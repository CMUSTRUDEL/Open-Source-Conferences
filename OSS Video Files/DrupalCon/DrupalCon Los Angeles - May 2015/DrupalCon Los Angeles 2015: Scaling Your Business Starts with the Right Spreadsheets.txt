Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Scaling Your Business Starts with the Right Spreadsheets
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Starting a Drupal shop takes engineering experience, guts, and intuition. Those instincts can help you get a successful business off the ground, but growing a business from a handful of contractors to a team of 15, or even 150, employees requires data-driven decision making. Consider the following questions:

What's the right volume and mix of client projects to afford hiring staff dedicated to specific practice areas, such as user experience, design, and backend engineering?
What's the weighted value, or pipeline value, of all work under contract plus likely new business and ongoing support contracts?
What's your billable hours target for a particular month based upon staff availability, training, and internal resource needs?
What's your projected "effective billing rate" for the next 6 months based upon the value of all contracts, technical debt, etc.?
In this session, we will review tools and techniques, namely some really awesome spreadsheets, for staying on top of these questions. Don't reinvent the wheel! Join us to collaborate and share management tools that will help you make better long-term decisions for your business. Learn how ThinkShout became the 9th Fastest Growing Private Company in Portland in its third year, as well as how Forum One has grown to become one of the largest and most established Drupal companies in the United States.

Andy lagan it's just like everyone that

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:10,050
I want to see and the rest you guys okay

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,240
so I'm going to dive in real quick so we

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,509
can spend most of the time kind of

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,449
looking at spreadsheets so this is a

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,970
session you're in a session about google

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,859
spreadsheets lots of fun and the google

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,689
spreadsheets and tools that we use at

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,320
think shout to be able to actually know

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,990
what the heck we're doing so a little

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,700
bit more about us and think shout think

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,680
shots based in Portland Oregon were

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,200
about four and a half years old at this

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,350
point it was started by me and left

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,840
sipping my business partner levas our

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,539
CTO I'm our CEO I managed more the sales

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,680
marketing strategy side of the shop and

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,449
then he managed our development team so

00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,010
again four and a half years old we

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,800
started out just with the two of us like

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,570
lab and I did the traditional thing just

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,579
two independent contractors seven each

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,809
other out for about a year decided that

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,250
you know it's a lot like getting married

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,140
starting a business if you've done that

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,750
with a business partner like we just

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,510
kind of recorded each other we got a

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,000
prenup in place all that stuff and then

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,860
decided to pull the trigger we just

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
started out with we each put 500 bucks

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,310
and a bank account and we were

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,810
profitable on day one which is really

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,880
awesome with Drupal you know like you

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,619
can really if you have some customers

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,700
you can just start billing and there's

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,270
really not a lot of overhead to get

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,939
started really fun so now we're a team

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,770
of full of 20 folks full time on site I

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,159
think by the end of the year will

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,500
probably be like 26 we're starting a

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:43,470
couple new initiatives and some new kind

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,060
of support services and I'm growing so

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,259
we've done a lot of open source stuff

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,540
like everybody else in this room i'm

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,950
sure there's about 50,000 websites

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,799
running on our code you've probably used

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,250
some of our modules MailChimp module

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,070
chimps rad Red Hen CRM our native CRM

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,219
for Drupal bat Salesforce sweet we

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,590
rewrote that for Drupal 7 and a lot of

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,420
other stuff out there leaflet module

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,580
stuff like that and and then

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,840
about a year ago now we were ranked the

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,340
ninth fastest growing company in

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,650
Portland Oregon which was really pretty

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,560
cool so what I want to kind of talk

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,209
about is the tools that we've used to

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,890
kind of I think and it's a little

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,540
presumptuous for me to say this and so

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,430
please hold me accountable and question

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,560
me and all that but like this stuff that

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,810
we've done to kind of jump to that I

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,250
don't know kind of mid lemme dear sighs

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,440
if you took kind of the averages of

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,720
Drupal shops we kind of like a lot of

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,500
folks I don't want to say stalled out

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,900
because we were doing really innovative

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,720
work and hiring great people but we kind

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,160
of had a hump there around employee

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,780
number like 10 to number 17 where there

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,519
was kind of a lot of churn and it was

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,230
kind of an awkward phase for us it was

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,030
kind of like our teenage phase you know

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,880
now I'd say that we're like really

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,340
arrogant freshman's in college but like

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,200
in our teens there we really kind of

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,299
made a lot of mistakes and I think

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,340
probably more important than anything we

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,510
didn't know what was going to happen at

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,299
the end of it every month when we did

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,790
billing like we knew intuitively oh yeah

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,190
we're profitable we're doing fine like

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,019
we've got tons we have we have the right

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,150
cash reserves like everything's stable

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,440
we're a stable healthy company but it

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,000
was kind of this guessing game at the

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,190
end of the month like the day before

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,540
building went out to say what was our

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,769
effective billing rate for this month

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,620
how much you know what was the average

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,910
our worth you know I knew basically what

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,320
we were going to invoice and basically

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,079
what our costs were so there's never any

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,459
concerns there but it was a little it's

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,709
a little weird to be running a company

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,359
that's based on building computer

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,980
software and not know every single

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,329
little detail so what we're going to

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,310
talk about our kind of the tools that we

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,299
use hopefully they kind of take us to

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,040
the next step and the stuff that's

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:48,109
allowed us actually scale really quickly

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,640
this calendar year in a way that we find

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:54,410
really sustainable so yeah so we'll talk

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,989
about that and then if you're interested

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,850
tomorrow just kind of promoting another

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,590
session there is on the business track

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,019
with this guy Kurt right here from form

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,060
one and me and Alex from zip tech and

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,889
Tracy from balance interactive a panel

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,910
on how to grow your business as well so

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,530
if you're interested in kind of more

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,569
than narrative side of things there's

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,639
some more sessions for that cool and

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,290
like I said to other folks last time I'm

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,489
going to say that when I show the

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,830
spreadsheets they're really hard to see

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,510
because its protector stinks so please

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,859
feel free to move forward and then feel

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,319
free to leave at any

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,460
not be held accountable for that so it's

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,490
totally okay to sit in front row and

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,979
leave alright so what the problems were

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,689
you know so I mean to be totally honest

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,419
I kind of feel like in this sound again

00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,949
a little bit on the arrogant side but to

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,860
be honest like I feel like anybody who

00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,240
has strong charisma and has like a

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,000
vision and cares about what they want to

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,490
do can probably build like a three to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,680
four to five to even ten person shop

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,310
like Drupal is really popular right now

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,069
if you've got spunk you can make it work

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,110
but what I found is kind of what would

00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,360
that spunk and that what helps kind of

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,770
folks like get these things started kind

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,020
of on the double edged sword is kind of

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,759
the opposite side of what you really

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,960
need to amend grow that company like

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,580
it's a different skill sets and

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,279
sometimes that spunk can kind of get in

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,569
the way so you know what I want to talk

00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,340
about is really kind of moving away from

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:15,469
that intuitive decision making process

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,599
that a lot of us who founded shops have

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:20,449
started off with you know it's how young

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:22,490
shops work early staffing decisions it's

00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,620
like can we hire this guy and like can

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,569
can me and my business partner work

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,219
enough hours into the evening to make

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,690
sure that we can always hit payroll for

00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:30,979
that first employee regardless of

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,389
whether or not we can build them you

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,839
know so you can kind of just gut it and

00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,009
just kind of make things work probably

00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,620
some stuff if you're a smaller shop

00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,270
you've encountered or a younger shop you

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,310
know it feels like it's always all hands

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,080
on deck all the time if you want to

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,810
specialize if you want to like innovate

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,400
a lot of times you're doing it at night

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,589
you're doing it on the weekends you know

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,180
you're working for your business all the

00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,689
time so you don't have that time to

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,830
really work on your business you know

00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,060
and any kind of sales and operations

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,500
stuff that stuff you're just boot

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,719
strapping on the weekends and whatever

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,349
you can you know so that's kind of like

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,879
the early days at least our early days

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,639
so you know you get to this point where

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,020
you start 12 wanting to track data some

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,520
things that we've found in starting this

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,729
that I think are useful points1 how many

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,879
of you guys use a time tracking system

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:24,919
like everybody good that's a pretty

00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,939
important first step but you know when

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,409
you start tracking data what our

00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:28,969
experience was is that there's there's

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,289
there's good metrics and meaningful

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,990
metrics and then there's really lazy

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,689
metrics you know one of the metrics that

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,399
we used a lot

00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,379
that is really lazy and what we found

00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,749
actually just in the last couple months

00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:42,249
we've kind of made a shift from it used

00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:44,199
to be that we track how many of you guys

00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,449
have your developers or your staff track

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,639
all of their time like all 40 hours a

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,199
week yeah so we were doing that and we

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,529
were evaluating the success of

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,909
developers based upon the lazy metrics

00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,399
we were getting there if somebody logged

00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:59,199
42 hours a week every week they worked

00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,319
harder than somebody who logged 41 hours

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,369
or who worked 39 hours you know and it

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,629
was because we were just trying to have

00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,339
as much data as we could but if you

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,559
think about it take a step back is that

00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,479
really meaningful like the fact that

00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,949
somebody did it somebody put a timer on

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,779
on the weekend when they are doing some

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,579
research and another person decided not

00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,259
to do that like is that really how you

00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,329
want to evaluate whether to stat how to

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,739
staff are performing so we've made the

00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,289
shift and now we only track billable

00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:25,599
hours because we realized not that we

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,879
realized that you know tracking the

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,800
energy and enthusiasm and commitment of

00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,749
our staff isn't important but just how

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,329
long they had the clicker the the timer

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:35,619
running wasn't what was really going to

00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,909
track that you know because you get that

00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,639
situation where someone just leaves a

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,439
timer running to go use the restroom you

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,969
know like you don't know like you can't

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,069
really know those level of details so

00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:46,479
trying to use that as information is

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:50,289
lazy and probably doesn't give you the

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:57,099
best data are the best information so a

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:58,300
couple other things yeah yeah right and

00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,739
you're not capturing that if the only

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,149
thing if you only have a chance to look

00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,649
at like five numbers and one of those

00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,509
numbers is total hours on your time

00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,399
tracking system are you really getting

00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:08,649
the information that you need so we've

00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,399
started to kind of question that the

00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,349
other thing is just kind of

00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,919
understanding what data is really good

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:16,659
enough so you know we've had the pitfall

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,899
of trying to work out some sort of big

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:21,099
crazy tool to figure something out and

00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,279
it was overkill and we ended up just

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:25,599
missing opportunities to see data sooner

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,309
but then also on the flip side kind of

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,329
recognizing what kind of information you

00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:30,759
need to actually say that you're

00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:32,589
starting to see trends so um we've just

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,379
been like kind of with agile like we're

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:37,240
not an agile shop necessarily we're in

00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,919
iterative shop but just kind of

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,839
iterating on the tools and the reports

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,610
that we're trying to do kind of the last

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,009
kind of big learning that I've had and

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,649
doing all this stuff is a prediction as

00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,520
part of measurement so when we build a

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,660
tool like when I

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,430
the spreadsheets i'm going to show you

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,340
one of the things that's been really

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,300
critical for us is like use the tool

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,680
predict the results that we're going to

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,420
get and then at the end of the month or

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,490
whatever the reporting period is going

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,260
back and reviewing that and that way I

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,840
can actually see if the logic that we're

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,130
using if it's if it's really the right

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,940
tool to figure out the information I

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,080
want to figure out so kind of an

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,160
overview of this tools that we're going

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,290
to show you and then we're just going to

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,080
dive into some really nerdy spreadsheets

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,970
for a little while so kind of an

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,740
overview of our system and our tools for

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,360
tracking your business try them tracking

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,010
tool how many you guys use harvest what

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,660
else out somebody who's feels really

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,440
passionate about some other tool time

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:36,220
tracking tool tell me what it is

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,140
freshbooks with how many folks okay

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,590
awesome yeah that's really cool anything

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:48,310
else that people really like zero tempo

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:53,950
awesome okay toggle yeah awesome what

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:55,300
we're using okay teamwork cool okay yeah

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,640
so we use harvest there's no right

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,960
answer there one thing that we like

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,810
about harvest I'm skipping a bullet

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,520
point here is the new forecast app fork

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,950
they bought I guess they bought forecast

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,110
app calm and they're rolling it in as an

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,490
extra service forecast app like we

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,770
haven't used it in production admittedly

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,670
but it's a resourcing tool for staffing

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:17,140
and it's awesome it looks really awesome

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,000
it looks like it's really cool and show

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,320
you if you have people over booked it

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,640
combines that against your project

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,990
budget so it's actually we're pretty

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,430
excited about it and it might cut out a

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,280
spreadsheet that we've been using and

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,890
that's really hard to work with so cool

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,360
so time tracking the key thing resource

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,500
allocation spreadsheet I'm not going to

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,940
show you what that looks like because

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,180
those are actually there's a lot of ways

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,180
to do that there's two that I really

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,310
want to kind of dive into in detail and

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,660
one would be we have a billable hours

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,750
matrix that we use and we're going to

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,900
dive into that and then what we call

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,120
like an aggregated pipeline tool that

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,500
allows us to kind of see allows us to

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,140
forecast how much money we're going to

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,220
make a month from now two months from

00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,530
now and so forth so we're going to dive

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,930
into that and then putting it all

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,880
together what sort of what

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,550
we're quickbooks online folks what other

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,060
accounting stuff do you guys use zero

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,410
okay awesome 0 we know it when I first

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,080
looked at zero it seemed like it was

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,000
better for folks in outside of you like

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,800
it was actually better adoption it's out

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,800
of New Zealand right yeah

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:35,710
that's awesome ok 0 oh you do ok yeah

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,950
we've kind of gone QuickBooks cuz

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,930
accountants tend to you know be more

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,690
familiar with it so we just saves us

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,790
money on the account on the CPA side but

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,020
that's interesting any other tools eight

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:52,060
folks were using for accounting stuff

00:11:47,020 --> 00:12:00,730
that's been really useful just works ok

00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm not familiar with that one cool ok

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,410
yeah that's me yeah it's outside of the

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,210
topic of this presentation we've also

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,000
just as a quick tip we've adopted

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,990
zenefits I don't know if anybody's using

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,700
zenefits or heard of them zennie fits is

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,050
awesome I mean it's completely

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,270
revolutionized our business so zenefits

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,830
is a service as well as it's a web app

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,890
as well but more importantly a service

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,930
that does benefits managing and it's

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,140
being it's it's a start up so they're

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,550
kind of have this IT feel and there's a

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,790
really great suite of tools but they

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,800
basically they manage all of our all the

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,270
procurement on health care all that

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,070
stuff they provide a portal for at all

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:43,300
it's absolutely incredible in the safest

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,890
ton of time that's it yeah so check out

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,390
zenefits it's really great the CEO of

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,670
the company and it's like a 300 person

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,530
company actually on boards all the

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,850
customers directly I mean like their

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,520
tools are that efficient it's amazing

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,750
it's awfully personal cool ok so we're

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,920
going to dive into spreadsheets the last

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,290
thing I kind of want to say with all of

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,910
this and this has been useful kind of a

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,160
concept for us as we've been rolling out

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,050
these spreadsheets because obviously you

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,080
know this these spreadsheets are really

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,190
great tools for founders or you know

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,660
executive staff but you're probably

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,410
going to be showing the staff or it's

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,730
really an impact your team and so you

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,380
know there's a lid of a risk when you

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,660
roll out any kind of tool or kind of

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,450
change your practices around tracking or

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,430
managing expectations with your team so

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,290
we've kind of had to develop if we've

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,610
developed a messaging framework about

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,650
that in a way of thinking about that

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,080
with our staff to make sure that they

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,400
understand what's going on so this is

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,870
just kind of you know everything that

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,640
we're doing in terms of reporting kind

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,480
of comes back to these three things that

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,550
we're really trying to support

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,020
internally and whatever framework

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,700
whatever values you might have in

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,890
internal values with your team it could

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,270
be whatever you want but for us the idea

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,700
of you know we're really trying to

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,100
balance innovation and clients customer

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,800
success or client success with staff

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,020
satisfaction so as we're like adjusting

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,790
and tinkering with all these things it's

00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,620
all in service to this and so that way

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,720
like we roll out a new policy with our

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,280
team and it fails we can really kind of

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,320
talk about that transparently with our

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,670
team and and let them understand that

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,720
this is the balance we're trying to hit

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,160
we're not always going to hit it

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,680
sometimes we're going to be in more

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,840
service to our staff we're going to send

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,010
a boatload of people to drupalcon even

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,980
though it might not make the most sense

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,210
business-wise we're going to like or on

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,440
the flip side we might have a couple

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,540
weeks where we have to really push it

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,980
and we're going to skip staff lunches or

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,870
skip sprints and we're all going to work

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,340
really hard on client stuff so having

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,310
this in place really allows us to kind

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,660
of implement solutions that are coming

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,830
out of the data broken out that make

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,280
sense what's that Xena Fitz it's like

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:43,660
benefits but with a Z instead of a B

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,500
zenefits calm cool all right so now

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,930
we're going to dive into some

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,700
spreadsheets so I am at my twitter

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,440
handle is I didn't have a great way of

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,320
doing this my twitter handle is Sean

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,910
underscore Larkin more you can just find

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,770
think shout on Twitter and there's a

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,150
link to this like so all of the

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,220
materials that i have here and all the

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,600
spreadsheets it's all in a Google Drive

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,250
folder and it's all available to you

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,110
guys so please grab it take it

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,010
manipulate it use it however you want to

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,240
use it there's no secret sauce so it's

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,700
all out there if you just want to find a

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,470
link on twitter but just because i

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,320
didn't obviously want to use like actual

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,500
client data or tell you exactly how much

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,000
money we make or whatever so the

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,440
spreadsheets have all been adjusted a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,910
little bit to use the mongolian torque

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,700
has anyone ever used this currency i

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,070
have not you have you were you were

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,110
awesome i intentionally did not even

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,580
look up the exchange rate anything like

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,380
that it's just a placeholder they had

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,290
they had the coolest currency symbol and

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,570
in google docs so we use it for that

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,310
reason but so none of the stuffs all

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,170
been abstracted it's not real data

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,140
there's no like algorithm to try to

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,030
figure out what it would be in real life

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,250
but you'll see that and we'll dive into

00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,640
this so one last thing before we dive

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,740
into this

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,660
red sheets it's how it sounds like

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,730
really simple but for a long time like I

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,770
couldn't figure out why my forecasters

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,470
weren't all that great in terms of

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,760
revenue stuff we do all of this

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,830
forecasting and you'll see it in here

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,600
for the most part by week as opposed to

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,310
buy month and that's because there's

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,690
different numbers of business days in

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,190
every month so your targets for each

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,530
month should probably change on the

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,240
revenue side maybe even on the costing

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,970
side depending on how you things are set

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,380
up so if you get confused as to have

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,890
some of the equations work that's kind

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:30,430
of what's going on there all right so we

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:32,710
are going to dive in and get going here

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,940
so cool one other thing that you'll find

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,340
in here that just really helpful a plug

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,590
to some of that we don't even work with

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,090
these guys we were put on to them by the

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,130
great folks here at four kitchens I know

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,240
Lola bot uses them as well but summit

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:53,770
CPA group they're a virtualized CFO firm

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,840
from what I hear they're awesome yeah

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,280
they're really great and they've helped

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,790
a lot of Drupal shops really kind of

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,220
navigate complex you know shareholder

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,650
arrangements and profit-sharing policies

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,510
and all kinds of stuff like that but one

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,970
thing they put out at the operations

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,880
camp operations camp I also heard is

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,310
really cool did you go oh yeah we should

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,390
have hooked you out we had people their

00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,339
operations camp great conference it's

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,390
it's more business operations but it

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,709
also kind of touches on project

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,199
management operations and stuff like

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:26,530
that too but it's a annual conference

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,089
was just down in Louisiana but this came

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,960
out of that so these are just some

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,820
metrics that they recommend that you

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,650
take or pay attention to if you're

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,150
running your business we won't really

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,040
run through this right now but just as a

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,300
reference it's something that might be

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,480
interesting and it's in the Google Drive

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,750
cool all right so the two spreadsheets

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,120
that I am kind of most proud of that you

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,460
can't see where the damn from way back

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,520
there so again please feel free to come

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,220
up this billable hours matrix and then

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,260
in under what we're calling like a

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,260
pipeline report or under contracts so

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,360
these two things work together this bill

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,280
will ours matrix is like the core thing

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,670
that we figure out what are reasonable

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,760
expectations

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,620
for our developers for our strategist

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,670
for our designers in terms of what can

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,550
we expect from them to do in terms of

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:23,990
work for us so I'm going to jump the

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:28,160
size up here a little bit again we're

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,390
using our mongolian currency so cool so

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,460
and I'm going to walk you through this

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,550
and then again like you grab a copy of

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,750
this use it do whatever you want with it

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,030
cool so the first thing that we try to

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,860
figure out is kind of like what is our

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,440
you know abstract profit margin that we

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,660
want to hit for us it's generally

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,400
something between you know fifteen

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,870
percent and you know maybe even like

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,580
twenty-two twenty-three percent and a

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,900
crazy big month where we will kind of

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,770
want to catch up on stuff or really

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,940
focus on client success so we kind of

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,140
looked at that and then you know

00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,820
everything else here is trying to figure

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,350
out well how can we support that goal

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,670
while also supporting other internal

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,260
goals that we have is our team so the

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,270
core there's a couple assumptions here

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,550
and again just spreadsheet assumptions

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,920
here you can adjust this this assumes in

00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,320
this case it costs us you know a hundred

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,200
thousand Mongolian torques a month to

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,030
pay our staff with our current size and

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,450
our target effective billing rate is

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,590
going to be 100 Turks per hour so this

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,270
is an interesting thing what is

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,590
effective billing rate so many people

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,990
that define that really differently in

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,850
our case here it s it's kind of like

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,740
average billing rate so all the hours

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,120
that we're working on client stuff what

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,190
do we want the average our that's

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,770
serving clients are working on client

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,710
projects to be worth okay some people

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,760
yeah like I said some people call that

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,170
average billing rate and then they use

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,800
effective billing rate to include all

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,200
hours that are non client related in

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,430
this case this is just saying average

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,830
averaged out for when we're actually

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,420
doing client work and then kind of what

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,610
is your base number of hours per week

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,830
per staff so that's kind of where we

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:07,130
start here and then we go through our

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,690
team for each role and I try to figure

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,490
out what people are actually going to be

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,260
working on and this is if you've ever

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,260
tried to solve this this is a complex

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:19,460
problem too when you talk about like

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,050
effective you know the utilization it

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,360
gets really confusing what people call

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,679
you

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,130
ization when they're talking about their

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:29,120
staff so for us we have like a maximum

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,610
utilization and then a realistic

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,660
utilization because community and mainly

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,040
we have these two distinctions

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,830
communicating around these expectations

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,690
to staff is really difficult you know if

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,610
you tell staff it's really kind of

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,799
confusing when you tell staff hey if you

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,799
work 40 hours this week we want you to

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,690
do 32 or 35 or Wow ever many billable

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,390
hours you have well then what happens

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,010
when there is a vacation day like does

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,570
that change number of billable hours and

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,220
so forth so like it gets really

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,280
confusing as how you talk about this

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,230
stuff with your teams so we kind of

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,330
broken out both options here so each

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,190
staff by position you know we're

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,460
assuming that they work 40 and 40 hours

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,410
a week and then we say okay you know on

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,559
a 40-hour week if they only did client

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,150
work what's a realistic expectation so

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,320
if they are not taking vacation they

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,780
don't have a conference in all of that

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,980
you know for this role for this designer

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,590
role I'm assuming that you're going to

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,490
work 32 billable hours that week and

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,980
then you kind of go through each of

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,780
these staff people project managers if

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,070
you're like us your project managers are

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,080
having more context which is so you

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,190
expect on a 40-hour week that they're

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,900
probably not going to be the bill as

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,299
much because they're as a developer

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,220
because they're not heads down working

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:40,650
so we kind of run through that and that

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,510
gives us kind of in that kind of ideal

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,090
situation how many billable hours could

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,150
we possibly hit in a week so with this

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,340
team here that's kind of got three

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,900
unbuildable staff on it and nine

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,280
billable staff that are all billing

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,510
different different amounts because they

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,460
have different roles we're assuming that

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,400
they could do like 300 and just shy of

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,440
350 hours so that's kind of the course

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,299
high level stuff in terms of how we talk

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,679
with our staff but the reality is that

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,600
we have people that are doing a lot of

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,640
different things and we have senior

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,260
engineers who we want to do

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
presentations at drupal cons and maybe

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,070
our junior engineers have other stuff

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
that we want them to prioritize so you

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,440
know we're not asking them we're not

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,480
investing and then doing speaking

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,740
engagements quite yet you know they're

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,440
really focused on developing their own

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,240
skills so here we've kind of broken out

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,790
and this could be different for anybody

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,230
for all of our for anybody here what are

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,970
the realistic things that we're looking

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,710
for them to do each week based upon the

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,780
roles and their interests and so forth

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,010
so these are kind of the big buckets

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,690
that we're using again

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,360
isn't translating the time tracking but

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,070
just in terms of expectation management

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,140
you know management responsibilities for

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,310
people who are leading teams you know

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,280
there's a couple folks who might have

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:50,460
that and so forth and this allows us to

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,220
say okay on average looking at vacation

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,330
time and pto and all this other stuff

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,250
that we know we're going to have

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,890
drupalcon the nonprofit technology

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:02,730
conference whatever it might be what

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,350
what can we actually expect on a reason

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,180
on an average week in terms of the

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,250
billable hours at this team this team is

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,810
producing so there's a big gap there you

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,530
know if everybody was just working and

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:15,390
not taking pto 350 hours but knowing

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,520
that people do take pto and they should

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,510
probably about two hundred and seventy

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,210
eight hours so so that let's just kind

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,490
of really kind of get a bigger picture

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,800
of what is actually going to happen in

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,000
our business so down here in this part

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,410
what we're doing here is we're just

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,600
projecting out okay we know what our

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,220
costs are we know what our salaries we

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,010
want our salaries to be we know how much

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,600
people can work what could we expect in

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,580
this scenario in terms of profitability

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,070
in these two scenarios the ideal

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,990
everybody's crank in 40 hours and then

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,210
the realistic people taken vacation and

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,980
so forth so that allows us to kind of

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,960
sanity check okay well if all this stuff

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,940
is working the way we think it is and

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,620
our costing is right we can expect under

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,110
this scenario to get about sixteen

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,820
percent profit margin and the realistic

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,040
scenario of having folks actually take

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,530
vacation and so forth and then we can

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,690
kind of play with that you know so if we

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,390
want to pump that up then we could make

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,770
a business decision well you know what

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,050
some of these unbuildable tasks here

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,280
like team sprints and set it in Sprint's

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,350
every every month we're going to do a

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,240
sprint every other month and that might

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:22,170
allow us to get more billable hours out

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,450
you know out the door each week and pop

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,030
that and bump that profitability margin

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,680
up or on the flip side if that margin is

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,780
like because of your equation is working

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,070
out to be like twenty percent

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,810
profitability well maybe maybe you need

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,720
to focus more on long-term innovation as

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,490
a marketing strategy and start including

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,000
more meaningful Sprint's with your team

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,770
take you know a day every month off or

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
every other month off with your team to

00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,700
work on some open source project that

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,540
that isn't client related so that make

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,560
sense

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:57,030
cool so kind of having to figure this

00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,670
out it allows us to actually start doing

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,140
some forecasting for what we can expect

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,550
for the rest of the year so i'm assuming

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,810
on this spreadsheet here that we're

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:09,450
starting out in january and looking at

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,340
the whole year so what we have here and

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,140
all these spreadsheets are all in tabs

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,270
are all interact interactive obviously

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,580
is pulling over from that that matrix

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:21,150
that i had here's that team that we have

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,870
right here this is what their monthly

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,940
targets are and then this is um you know

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,340
showing what we can expect each month

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:34,140
and what this allows us to do that is an

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:39,540
ugly spreadsheet right there is a start

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,280
to get a sense of what sort of what

00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,050
growth might look like if we start

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,300
hiring a different folk additional folks

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,700
so for us we just kind of kept it really

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,590
granular here and assume that you know

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,880
average engineer it's like how many

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,500
people were going to hire over the

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,850
course of the year this is not real

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,830
we're going to hire a different strategy

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,420
but just kind of the show you okay well

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,540
let's say in June we hire another

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,430
developer then and then we're in July

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,380
let's hire designer and then a femur and

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,150
then another engineer and that allows us

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,950
to kind of get a sense of well what what

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,620
are the total billable hours that we can

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:14,160
expect in this growth scenario for the

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,990
course of the year this variance right

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,850
here and this deviation is kind of like

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,740
allows us to kind of worst-case scenario

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,930
stuff you might not need this we've just

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,580
kind of find found it helpful to like in

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,680
terms of managing expectations to kind

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,180
of think about well certain months maybe

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,430
we know that we're probably going to

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,020
decide to do some strategic open source

00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,720
contributions or send a bunch of people

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,120
at conferences so maybe a job being able

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,730
to kind of adjust down or up each month

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,200
in a way that we know it's going to be

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,430
but again that allows us this allows us

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,690
to kind of forecast well how many

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,460
billable hours are going to have this

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,890
whole year if this scenario works and

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,330
then you know given that effective

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,670
billing rate or that average billing

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,730
rate what can we expect in terms of

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,560
revenue with this growth pattern that we

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,640
have here and this kind of allows you to

00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,520
start playing with it and we've actually

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,290
used this in practice kind of like we'll

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,010
get more specific and be like well we

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,050
know we're hiring

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,330
buddy next month but they start mid

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,830
month you know so actually just saying

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,910
they're not they're not an expense for

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,110
that full month they're not going to

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,060
build for that full month they're only

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,260
going to build for half of it or being

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,430
able to say well we're hiring a junior

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,620
person and they're going to have some

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,120
ramp up time so let's kind of get

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,570
specific about the hours that they're

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,920
going to provide and that allows us to

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,490
kind of get a sense for what our total

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,200
revenues are and then down here just

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,910
because we can we can start to just kind

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,740
of do some month to month over tracking

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,770
to see how well this model is working

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,630
for us so where it gets interesting is

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,190
actually been translating this to profit

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,020
doesn't really matter how much revenue

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,140
you make I guess it doesn't some some

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,930
ways but start thinking about profit

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,060
here so this is again just kind of

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,820
linking off the last spreadsheet this is

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,740
our current base those 14 staff you can

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,330
see this number goes up just i just

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,500
added a little multiplier saying that

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,000
you know obviously the staff we

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,860
currently have they want raises bastards

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,660
and so assuming that you know that base

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,820
that base salary is going to go up and

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,230
then looking you know this is really

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,810
course but looking at what are our

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,210
additional costs if we start bringing on

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,810
these other developers that allows us to

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,760
get kind of what our projected costs are

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:19,080
and then compare that to our revenue to

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,120
kind of get a sense of kind of

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,070
predicting what what our profitability

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,830
would be for the year in these different

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:30,000
growth scenarios so it makes sense cool

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,340
so you can kind of see with how that

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,810
impacts you know what your forecast

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,710
would be for that year if you if you hit

00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:40,980
those targets and then this last tab and

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,420
this one is the most kind of arcane and

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,830
I don't really know a great way of doing

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,960
this stuff yet I'd love to talk to

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,450
somebody else who has incredible sales

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,240
metrics and forecasting and stuff like

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:53,820
that but what kind of a pipeline do we

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,960
want to maintain a sales pipeline do we

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,310
want to maintain to be able to hit these

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,800
revenue targets so here are those

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:04,320
revenue targets that have been bumped

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,880
this one up here are the revenue targets

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,840
that we brought over from the second tab

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,010
and then you know what size pipeline do

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,720
we want to maintain to be able to hit

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,980
that and this is where it's kind of a

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,620
weird it's not as a pseudoscience

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,730
essentially you know because just

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,900
because you have something in your sales

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,610
pipeline you're not going to obviously

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,980
that doesn't translate to revenue that

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,559
month you know so this is kind of me

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,600
guessing around saying well you know I

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,460
really want this pipeline to reflect the

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,570
revenue goals that I have next quarter

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:38,710
or three months down the pike so you

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:40,870
know uh hoops that's not a good number

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,400
what kind of revenue goals would I what

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,679
what how big do I want that sales

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,480
pipeline to be and and how do I actually

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,860
kind of want to wait the value of that

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,510
pipeline knowing that is not all going

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:54,130
to close so does that make sense cool so

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,140
this is again like this is what this

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,390
tool here this bill will ours matrix is

00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,610
what we use that kind of like do the

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,010
theoretical work to kind of figure out

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,660
what our goals are and again you know

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,400
the goals change and you can adjust them

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,080
you know you might decide over the

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,669
summer like summers are going to be when

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,610
we really innovate Drupal eights coming

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:13,809
out so we know okay this summer we're

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,330
probably going to reduce the number of

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:18,570
billable hours that we focus on so that

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:21,370
we can have better Drupal 8 preparedness

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,630
and then you know in the fall we're

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,549
going to crank it back up and really

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,350
focus on client work and this stuff is

00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:27,490
important again in terms of messaging to

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,010
your team because they want to

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,360
understand what the logic is in terms of

00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,970
the decisions that you're making as a

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,350
business owner or as a team manager they

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,120
want to understand that there is some

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,299
sort of logic going into those decisions

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,419
so it does it feel arbitrary cool all

00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:46,450
right so this is my pride and joy the

00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:48,640
thing that I love the most of anything

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,240
that we use in our company it's what we

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,100
call an under contracts spreadsheet our

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,210
team our project managers Marcy can tell

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,669
you over there would probably spend you

00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,130
guys spend 15 20 minutes on this every

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,450
day yeah so it's like three it's got

00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,220
like four or five people updating this

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,740
thing kind of threw out like kind of

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,540
asynchronously all the time we tried to

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,950
think of other tools for this and I hate

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,179
using a google spread like having so

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,950
much of the business based on a single

00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:13,780
google spreadsheet but like we just

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,490
couldn't find anything that work so the

00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:21,280
problem that this spreadsheets trying to

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:22,660
solve is how do i figure out like i said

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
at the Ted of the that's the start of

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,980
this how do I figure out how much money

00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,750
I'm going to make next month you know so

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,520
I know that I've got like you know

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,780
I don't know 15 projects or five

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,960
projects whatever that number might be

00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,670
and because you know business this

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,770
business I gotta negotiate different

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,210
rates for different customers some

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,460
people are at a historical rate some

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,910
people are at a new rate some projects

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,650
have technical debt you know so that's

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,090
kind of pulling down the effective

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,940
billing rate on that project like how do

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,860
i actually know it's you know it's it's

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,970
May twelfth right now how do I know how

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,200
much money I'm going to make this month

00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:01,600
you know so so that's what this thing is

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,520
intended to try to solve and then beyond

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,080
that like you know three months from now

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,790
what how much money I'm going to make

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,290
three months from now I got the same I

00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,780
got some projects that are going to be

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,850
finished by then I've got stuff in the

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,500
sales pipeline that might be at maybe

00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,060
were doing awesome and so we're gonna we

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,820
have stuff in the sales pipeline at a

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,080
much higher rate or maybe like I'm a

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,330
little desperate three months from now

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,770
and so you know or I want to take on

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,630
something that's technically risky

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,340
because it's a really cool project and

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,870
let me do a technology that I want to

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,190
play with so I know that there's

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,900
probably going to be some technical debt

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,040
on a project that I'm that's probably in

00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,330
a closed and the next month and that

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,350
will start three months or now how do I

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:40,030
figure out do I have the right suite of

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,040
current project support projects and new

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:45,580
business so that's what this

00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,650
spreadsheets trying to solve so it

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,140
starts out with a tab that's just every

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:52,450
single contract every single opportunity

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,980
that's on the board and it might

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,260
actually be stuff that's closed out too

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,480
so this first tab here gets really long

00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,360
for us so I'll show you that kind of a

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,740
high level here and you can you don't

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,350
know what the heck's going on from that

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,550
view but essentially it's every contract

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,210
and then a bunch of parameters about

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,640
each one of them we do not work with the

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,730
major league baseball but just as an

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,230
example here so we have a line for each

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,670
of these the other thing that this does

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,080
is what we found is that actually the

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,060
spreadsheet everybody on our team

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,560
everybody who's managing projects pretty

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,050
much everyone but the development team

00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,790
or the design team uses this tool all

00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,470
day long because the other thing that we

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,390
found that it does is it's just like

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,130
kind of the one document of record like

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,770
how many of you guys have at this point

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,420
in your business have like probably some

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,880
Google Drive folder that has like a

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,710
hundred contracts in it you know like

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,990
how do you know how to find them you

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,670
know

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,500
like you try to do naming conventions

00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,840
and then business development people

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,820
were terrible at naming conventions we

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,660
throw stuff all over the place so how do

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,460
you actually keep all that stuff

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,550
straight to know what contract you're

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,340
working on so we came up with a

00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,170
contracting naming convention here and

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,450
this translates to harvest harvest has

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,800
really great project codes these these

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,330
client codes this is kind of our

00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,190
document of record for client codes

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,200
client clothes are really easy to

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,090
implement in QuickBooks it allows us to

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,550
kind of actually have everything on the

00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:17,720
right naming convention here so our

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,550
contract IDs here it took a lot for the

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,860
Nerds to get the biz dev people to be

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,810
cool with this but the naming convention

00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,960
here you can't really see it but it's

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,760
the client code then there's an m4 the

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,790
mast you know the master services

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,820
agreement that we're working under so

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:38,149
you know that the MSA that we're using

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,679
the scope of work the esso w has a

00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:41,419
naming convention and then this last

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,790
part here the sea and then the zeros

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:45,290
that's change orders so that allows us

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,030
to actually have kind of like our own

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,310
Dewey Decimal System they kind of track

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,020
like okay this project is a change order

00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,149
but it's a witch scope of work and then

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,649
which master services agreement do I go

00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,750
back to if I need to kind of understand

00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:00,020
the contracting terms that allows us to

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,670
kind of see how that stuff works out you

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:05,119
know this is just a link to the to that

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,670
document in Google Drive the link to the

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,900
harvest project so this is the idea here

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,060
is that any time we bring on a new

00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,890
project manager or account manager they

00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,300
can just use this form here and nowhere

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,000
to go to actually figure out what's

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,430
going on that was like when I talk about

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,800
that awkward stage like we had a project

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,480
manager leave I think we have to project

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,119
managers leave behind the size of like

00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,100
you know from being 12 to being like 20

00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,619
and those are incredibly expensive

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,270
transitions for project information but

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,730
also just account information like how

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,680
do you figure out what change order that

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,300
p.m. kind of got sign off on and all of

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,970
that so this allow this document allows

00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,859
us to manage that and again for each of

00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,950
these line items what is it is a scope

00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:47,690
of work is it a master services

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,340
agreement like so not you know is it a

00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,900
change order it's just a support

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,430
contract or is this a proposal that

00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,160
we're managing and what's cool here too

00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,500
if variables in google and google docs

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,260
are awesome i can actually just define

00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,670
these pick lists and a spot here I don't

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,050
have it turned on now because I wanted

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,150
you to be able to use this tool but

00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:10,150
Google Docs actually has a really great

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,859
new cell protection like to be able to

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,990
have certain tabs or certain ranges

00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:15,880
actually be protected so this way you

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,890
can kind of like your admin you can set

00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,210
this stuff up let your project managers

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,440
use it but there's certain stuff that

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,020
you know that they can't accidentally

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,970
hit a keystroke and kill everything so I

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,839
kind of manage what these these tabs are

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:32,890
what these pick lists are but we have

00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:36,069
our you know type our status you know so

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,170
this is this an active project is it in

00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:40,480
sales is it on hold is it completed is

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,460
it a deprecated meaning that like we add

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,109
the scope of work and then we gave it to

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,579
the client we have a copy of it in

00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:47,859
Google Drive but it's not the one we're

00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:49,690
working off of or you know we actually

00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,819
even use it for like managing sales

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,819
metrics like did we lose the project

00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:56,349
where did we disqualify the lead all of

00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:59,710
that so that we can do a lot of

00:36:56,349 --> 00:37:01,240
reporting on this am's and pm's this is

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,589
kind of become our document of record to

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
figure out wait we've got like for

00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:07,089
project managers and like three account

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,829
managers who the heck is responsible for

00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,240
this project like as you grow it gets

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,119
more and more difficult to think about

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,260
all that and keep it all in your head

00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,220
percentage likelihood to close this is

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,119
going to come in when we talk about

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:21,339
sales stuff date we want it date we

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:26,309
started it date we completed it the

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:26,309
contract value which in most cases is

00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:30,819
I'm going to drop the size here just a

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,819
little bit we'll still see it okay

00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:35,589
contract value which is going to be you

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:39,490
know billable hours under contract times

00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:41,140
billable rate unbuildable hours under

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,690
contract so this has actually been

00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,549
really helpful to we were struggling

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,250
with like not all of our contracts are

00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:49,599
set up the same way we'd love it if it

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,220
was just like we negotiated rate

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,079
everything's billable but sometimes you

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,869
have cotton you know clients where you

00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,059
need to have certain line items we

00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,710
listed as unbuildable or we'll donate

00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:01,690
this feature so how do you actually

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,119
manage that you know some projects it's

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,830
like flat it's flat rate other projects

00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:09,420
it's a rate plus a you know a discount

00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,860
of ours and features and stuff like that

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,540
so this kind of allows us to kind of

00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,100
normalize all of that when we get into

00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,900
this looking at support work like what's

00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,730
the max velocity that we can work on our

00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,110
project you know as this contract set up

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,870
so we can only do 10 hours a month of

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:28,290
support and then what are we actually

00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:30,630
tracking what have we actually tracked

00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,130
against these contracts and harvest so

00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,900
this is admittedly a bit of a pain in

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,410
the butt to actually have to go through

00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:42,210
this and update what the actual czar and

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,440
harvest to to know kind of like okay

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,090
well we have this contract for a hundred

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,130
hours we've done 50 hours how many hours

00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,230
we have left what's the value of this

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,520
contract moving forward so there's a

00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:56,220
little bit of a pain in the butt Marcy

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:58,710
would you agree whatever Marcy does this

00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,050
stuff you know it's a little bit of a

00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,640
pain but the one thing that we've done

00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,560
just to kind of make it a little bit

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,420
easier it's like so we had these reports

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,680
and then we would say we would actually

00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,510
just have a different one like we would

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,250
change the data the report to say okay

00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,990
let's do this all at once but what's

00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,370
interesting is when you get a lot of

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,770
project managers they can't all just

00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:19,440
like do this on the same day at the same

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,930
time so we've kind of and again it's

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,670
it's a little old-school to have to be

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:26,250
doing this but we have this date checked

00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,480
value in here that says okay this is the

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,840
last time that this line of this

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,130
spreadsheet has been looked at and that

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,230
allows us to do updates to this

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,610
spreadsheet asynchronously you know

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,870
different people can touch it anytime

00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,790
they want throughout the week and we can

00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,860
kind of take trap pay attention to that

00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:43,140
so this is just a date field and what's

00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,970
kind of cool about it is that we have

00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,000
this conditional format are in there and

00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,760
Google Spreadsheets just format

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,120
conditional formatting that says if the

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,730
date checked is not within eight days

00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,920
show that line item is read show that

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,780
contractors read so this for me as a

00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,280
manager is that it sounds silly but it's

00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,390
like a huge thing that have that in

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,250
there because I can look at the

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,840
spreadsheet and if I see a lot of red it

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,880
means that the data is probably not the

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,740
data is a little stale so it's just kind

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,690
of this visual indicator to me that okay

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,700
like I'm not using the most recent data

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,080
I want it obviously there's obviously

00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,670
for us there's always going to be some

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,230
amount of red in the spreadsheet can't

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,970
update everything all the time but this

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,380
way I can kind of see Oh

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,580
am i working with good data or bad data

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,220
and i can again i can figure out what my

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,320
tolerance is for bad data in terms of

00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,119
the decisions i'm trying to make so this

00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,680
is kind of the data side here so this is

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,940
everything sales you know we have

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,890
another conditional format or if

00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,750
something's in sales it automatically

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,630
just turns to green if it's been

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,400
completed we just kind of have it you

00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,020
know greyed out but this is everything

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,040
so and for our copy of this we've been

00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,400
using this for about two or three months

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,480
this tab here is big it's like you know

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
there's hundreds there's probably a

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,770
hundred lines on it at this point but

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,060
again it kind of surfaces the stuff we

00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,310
needed the surface with sorting and

00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,740
stuff so where it gets really cool is

00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:04,109
actually the the spreadsheets that deal

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,849
with this data so pretty much the only

00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:07,740
thing that our staff touches is this

00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:10,020
first tab and everything else is just

00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,810
getting calculated for us and it's just

00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,000
providing reports so there's this cool

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:19,650
function in google spreadsheets that I'm

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,840
hiding here the filter function in

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,510
google spreadsheets it'll actually do

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,190
dynamic filters so so essentially what

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,310
this filter is doing here is it's

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:31,740
actually creating an entire list from

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:36,570
that initial proposal of all of the

00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:39,839
contracts that are that are listed as

00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:41,099
active so it's pulling this data here

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,570
and it's just pulling in that data

00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,930
straight away from the other tab and

00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:48,089
filtering the data that I want to see

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,609
does that make sense so I hide all of

00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:54,240
that because it's not really useful and

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:56,160
then this is all calculations based upon

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,260
this is all just doing some calculations

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,640
based upon what I'm seeing there and the

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,080
longer the short of this thing is it

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,550
allows me to say these are all the stuff

00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,770
that we have under active project this

00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,570
is not support work this is not sales

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,580
work these are just builds like feature

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,830
development you know new features

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,800
whatever we have like a scope of work

00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,720
for or and a project plan and a budget

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,940
it grabs all of that and what it does is

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,349
it says okay for everything active given

00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,260
what we've updated here and the other

00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:25,740
tab from harvest I'll make this big

00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,930
because it's what do we have left to do

00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,220
you know and again this was one of those

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,570
things that like every time I wanted to

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,580
figure this out before the spreadsheet

00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:35,040
I'd sit down in a coffee shop for like

00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,540
four hours and i go through every single

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,340
and every single project in harvest on a

00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,050
piece of scrap paper and I would try to

00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,550
figure out what this meant I never knew

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,650
it was like such a pain that I probably

00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,970
did that only like once a quarter so I

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,430
didn't really have good insight it was

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:49,290
all just intuitive so this is saying in

00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,820
this scenario given everything that

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,400
we've recorded and done here's the

00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,230
billable hours we have available for us

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,640
this technical debt this has also been

00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,980
something that's been incredibly helpful

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,260
so going back to that contracts and

00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,750
proposals I have a column that says what

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,370
do I predict as of today is the

00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,840
technical debt that I'm going to need to

00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,090
do for this project that I'm not going

00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,750
to get paid for to make everything work

00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:14,340
you know that's a good question

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,290
everybody kind of defines it differently

00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,520
for us it would be the clients on I'm

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,260
going to be happy unless we do these ten

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,540
hours and we're not going to pay for you

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,330
know it could be other stuff i mean so

00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,500
for us it's like it harvest it depends a

00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,270
lot a lot of the stuff has to get

00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,190
adapted a tool which kind of stinks but

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,200
like harvest with kind of the way that

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,720
the billing stuff goes we just found the

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,970
easiest thing was to have our rates per

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,640
project we do a blended rate if you do

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,720
if you do a rate card this stuff i don't

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,080
know how you're going to do this stuff

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:47,400
that's just I Kurt maybe you guys have

00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:52,560
this stuff with a rate card I don't know

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,870
like predicting yeah no just in general

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,430
like if you're doing like how do you

00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,110
know like how many hours you have

00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:00,350
available at the different rate card

00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,350
rates

00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:19,770
yeah yeah yeah

00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:26,509
yeah yeah and those are you guys have

00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:29,380
100 + people at different different

00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:33,229
types of problems different types of oh

00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,909
yeah okay yeah so different types of

00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:36,289
problems but for us with the blending

00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:37,549
rate that's kind of works so yeah so

00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:39,380
it's just how many hours are going to

00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,880
need to do you know like we know we

00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,159
finish this we know we're have a time of

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,630
materials contract but like goodwill is

00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,189
not going to be saved unless we do some

00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,779
extra work and obviously we'd love for

00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:52,519
that to be 0 but that's just never the

00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:55,519
case you know it's not realistic it's

00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:57,049
not no it's like it's a we put a junior

00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,729
developer on this and they messed up a

00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,069
CSS thing and we're not going to build a

00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:02,839
client for it and so but this is also

00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:04,759
something that we act this number right

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,439
here is huge for us because it kind of

00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,549
just lets us say this is all the

00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:08,749
technical debt because then the next

00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:10,909
decision that's outside of the

00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:12,319
spreadsheet is I've got 50 hours of

00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:14,239
technical debt that I'm not going to get

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,399
paid for how do I manage that in terms

00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,409
of cash flow and client expectations you

00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:19,999
know so that's a whole nother

00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:22,609
conversation about how to manage that

00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:24,199
but like that number basically or this

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:26,209
number is also helpful when I'm trying

00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:28,699
to negotiate a new sales contract and

00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:30,319
again it's some project using some cool

00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:31,789
technology and I know I'm not going to

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,079
get billed for all of it and I want but

00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:35,269
I really want that engagement so I'm

00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,889
going to give something away how much

00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:38,719
can I give away given the amount of

00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:40,929
technical debt that I have moving

00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:45,159
forward that I know i have to give away

00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:48,229
so that aggregate numbers helpful

00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,759
technical debt outstanding work the

00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:51,439
value of all the outstanding work again

00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:53,449
this is saying how many hours versus the

00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:56,509
rate that I'm probably going to get paid

00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:59,630
in reality for this work and that's kind

00:45:56,509 --> 00:46:01,429
of that's the order of these is a little

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,459
off i just realized but that's kind of

00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:05,719
shaking the effective billing rate and

00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:07,909
multiplying it by the outstanding work

00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:10,669
so again I've kind of got a color coding

00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:14,119
conditional field here these numbers

00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:16,569
here these effective billing rates if it

00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:19,519
drops I have a threshold of a hundred

00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:20,929
Mongolian currency pieces for this if it

00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,509
drops below that it turns red and that

00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:25,009
is an owner I look at this number right

00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:27,139
here all the time and I'm trying to

00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:30,589
figure to figure out I'm sorry I jump

00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:33,740
spreadsheets but to figure out again

00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:35,240
like am I in trouble and

00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,460
are we dropping below the effect of

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,980
billing rate that we need to be able to

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,480
hit our revenue goals and if I am that

00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,369
means well maybe I need to have some

00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,650
more uncomfortable conversations with

00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:47,210
some clients to say hey like we just

00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,610
this isn't a month where this isn't a

00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,010
month or a two month period as I spill

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,260
everything all over my computer where we

00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:57,170
can afford to do a lot of unbuildable

00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,060
extra work you know or or vice versa you

00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,950
know maybe you you know these these

00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,330
conversations aren't static like the way

00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,760
you obviously the way you approach

00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:07,040
conversations with customers about do

00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,140
stuff outside a contract changes some

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,610
months you might have you might be doing

00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,780
great and so you're like you know what

00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,880
this month we've been cranking out

00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,530
billable hours I'm going to have a

00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,210
higher tolerance for a customer saying

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,680
hey could you just do me a favor and do

00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,840
this extra feature here and not bill me

00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,040
for it you know this gives us a

00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:27,080
framework for that so again this is for

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,030
our active projects and what's been

00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,980
helpful what's helpful here is actually

00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:33,590
saying these having two separate lines

00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,640
here one is what is their effective

00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:39,200
billing rate for all of our outstanding

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,210
work so all the contracts that we have

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,470
the amount of work we've done is the

00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,060
amount of work we've done just moving

00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,160
forward what can I expect a bill and

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,570
then related to that but different is

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,000
what is the effect of billing rate on

00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,859
those contracts so including the work

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,119
under those contract the open contracts

00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:55,220
including the stuff that we've built

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,200
already those are two different data

00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,760
points there right and it's helpful in

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,460
different decisions with different

00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,450
decisions to be able to see either one

00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,619
largely this this one's the most

00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,510
important how much money I'm going to

00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:08,810
make everything's done up till today how

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:11,720
much money can I make moving forward so

00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,970
that's active projects again we have a

00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,460
similar tab here for support work this

00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,840
one admittedly I don't understand the

00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,700
exact science to this this is one of

00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,800
those tabs that like we're iterating on

00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,060
trying to figure out and forecast

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,890
support work has been something that's

00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,910
been really tricky for us not a big

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,230
portion of what we do probably

00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,470
represents about twenty percent of our

00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:32,210
business at this point it where it

00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:36,020
supports a totally different beast you

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:37,850
know so in this case I don't think I

00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,540
don't know I'm just trying to get some

00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:44,840
data and then going to go from there so

00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,220
on this one you know where I'm not going

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,420
to talk too much about this one cuz it's

00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,270
not

00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,339
great but like you know trying to look

00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,960
at this is basically got some rough

00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:54,640
algorithms and here to look at okay well

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,680
historically how many hours have we

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,510
build on average for the for the support

00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,369
contract you know we set up our support

00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,960
contracts generally like not to exceed

00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,730
we don't do retainers but it's like not

00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,140
to exceed 10 hours a month or in 20

00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,970
hours a month over 50 hours a month and

00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,369
then we kind of try to figure out well

00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,829
you know on the one hand you know if

00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:13,450
we're really good at kind of being

00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:15,280
proactive with a customer like we might

00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,690
be able to build more hours under that

00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,890
support contract because that we might

00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,720
be able to identify things that they

00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:22,030
want or you know figure stuff out and

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,829
really push you know so you know we we

00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,329
at we know we have a max that we can't a

00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:28,059
cap that we can't go over every month

00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:31,150
but we can hit that cap there might be

00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:32,680
other times where you know we have a cap

00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,059
but a client just doesn't ever hit it

00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,770
their sites really stable they don't

00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:37,089
have a lot of feature requests so you

00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,010
know the cat might be 10 hours but in

00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,809
reality we're doing security updates

00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:43,480
every month and it's like two hours of

00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:45,190
work you know so what we're trying to do

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,130
here is kind of figure out what's what's

00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:51,700
our average velocity you know what's our

00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:54,010
max velocity daily and then you know for

00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,420
a projected period you know going

00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,710
through this date and I just have it

00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,450
through the end of q1 like how many

00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,099
business days are there what's our

00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,510
averages what's our max and then try to

00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,780
have this spreadsheet kind of figure out

00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:05,829
well what what could we build under this

00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,049
and then what's kind of a realistic

00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:10,690
scenario for that does that make sense

00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:12,790
this this tab admittedly like every

00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,920
organization is different I haven't

00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,119
nailed this one but it represents about

00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,190
twenty percent of the business so I'm

00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,809
not if it's off by a 50-percent like

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,390
it's not throwing off all of our numbers

00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:26,829
that badly so just kind of a predictive

00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:28,900
one the sales pipeline this one as a

00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:31,299
sales guy I love and spend a lot of time

00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,940
in so again this is just going back to

00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:35,680
that contract spreadsheet pulling in the

00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,160
percentage likelihood the clothes for

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,160
these projects from that other tab from

00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,049
that first tab the likelihood of stuff

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,240
to close and then what is the actual

00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:51,280
weighted value of your sale of our sales

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:54,160
pipeline we we we just have some kind of

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,839
internal not even written down kind of

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,520
just rules of the road you know it's

00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,839
kind of we have a sales meeting every

00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,440
week and our sales team kind of sits

00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:01,360
down and we just

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,610
kind of play we kind of play poker on it

00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,770
to figure out what it is different folks

00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,930
have more more kind of robots

00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,820
categorizations on that and if you use

00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,980
like pipe drive or one of those some of

00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:14,770
those project products they'll they'll

00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,630
actually have stages that are set you

00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,700
know so if a project's been submitted

00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,280
and your invest in the final it gets

00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,950
forty percent likely to close we found

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,660
that kind of having rough criteria for

00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,640
that wasn't as nuances we want because

00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,990
like best and final if you're doing that

00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,670
final presentation and there's two

00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:33,130
people that you're committing against vs

00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,770
10 like the percentages should be

00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:38,500
different you know so we just kind of we

00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:43,060
just kind of horse trade to figure that

00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:44,530
out so you know we have our proposal

00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,420
value and the billing rate and again

00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,470
like each project might have a slightly

00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,840
different billing rate if you're trying

00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:52,120
to like increase the value increase your

00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,070
billing rate percentage likelihood of

00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,840
clothes and then this is the weighted

00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,310
value the weighted number of hours given

00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,840
the likelihood of clothes and then the

00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:05,860
weighted value given the likelihood it's

00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:08,440
close um yeah we have a CRM we use oh ho

00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:11,530
I'm not super stoked on it I'm it's

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,550
ironic that we're Salesforce leads and

00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:14,830
we don't use a sales force but

00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,360
Salesforce is friggin expensive we use

00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:21,880
it for nonprofit so it's free for them

00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:23,740
so but yeah we you know we we use this

00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,240
here and mostly for marketing stuff to

00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,950
be honest like the reports we just

00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,260
couldn't figure out I'm a terrible

00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,760
developer so I just I didn't want to

00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,490
have to try to figure out API stuff to

00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,030
populate this from something else so

00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:39,910
it's a little duplication you know but

00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:41,410
uh but again like okay so how many and

00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,650
that allows us to have this roll-up how

00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:46,000
many hours do we have in our pipeline

00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,560
what's the face value of that sales

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,910
pipeline because like these are also two

00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,170
different ways of looking at it what's

00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:52,810
the face value of all the leads that

00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,060
we're going after and then what's the

00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,740
pipeline value if we kind of adjust for

00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,500
percent is likely the clothes on each of

00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,920
those four projects and that allows us

00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,670
to figure out what's the face value

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,050
effective billing rate that we can

00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,650
anticipate for the stuff is in the

00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:09,670
pipeline vs what's the weighted value

00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,190
knowing that different things are more

00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:15,190
likely or not that makes sense

00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:17,619
cool so that lets us hat roll up to this

00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:19,210
single dashboard right here and again

00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:22,150
this I just kind of keep this open all

00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:24,640
the time throughout the day and this is

00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:27,910
kind of like the 10,000 foot view if we

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,650
take all of our active builds you know

00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,930
we take our support work that we have we

00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:35,619
take our sales pipeline what is kind of

00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:38,200
our forecast what's our runway moving

00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:39,460
forward so I get the details again just

00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,569
as kind of pulling in the deep the

00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,000
recaps from each of those other

00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:46,000
spreadsheets and then these numbers

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,849
right here these four numbers are the

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,140
ones that if I did stay up at night not

00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:52,690
be able to sleep would be the things

00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,190
that I would stress about the most so

00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:57,150
taking everything sales pipeline

00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,440
everything that we have how many hours

00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,000
from today moving forward with

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
likelihood the clothes and support and

00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,130
all that can I kind of just anticipate

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:10,410
that our team needs again these are made

00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,410
of values what's the value of that work

00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,960
what's the effective billing rate for

00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:16,030
that work what's the average billing

00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,740
rate going to be be there and then

00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,329
knowing what my costs are in this case

00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,369
you know a hundred thousand of these

00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:23,859
current is kind of made up currency

00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:26,140
what's my runway like what what can I

00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:28,030
comfortably say that like if we stop

00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,579
selling if we didn't have any change

00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:32,170
orders you know if we if we didn't do

00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:34,210
any additional sales work from today

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,220
forward like what can I anticipate in

00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,490
terms of the number of months that I

00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:41,319
have available to me so for us with this

00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,510
I'll say that I like this number to be

00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,910
like seven and a half months you know

00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,530
that's all that's all a matter of risk a

00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,740
matter of like cash flow a matter of

00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,180
like cash reserves all of that kind of

00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,200
other information that's just like a

00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,880
decision that you have to you know

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,540
tolerance for risk and stuff like that

00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,560
but for me and for our business you know

00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,640
I'll just say we like to keep I'll be

00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,069
very transparent with you guys we like

00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:09,910
to keep like probably two months worth

00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:11,829
of expenses cash in the bank then we

00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,859
want to have like another three months

00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:16,900
or another two months of accounts

00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:18,369
receivable so stuff that we've build but

00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,720
you know you never know if that it's not

00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:21,670
cash you don't know that people are

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,250
going to pay it and then like a month or

00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,350
two of credit so that's kind of like

00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,940
what we have you know obviously

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,980
receivable cash in the bank those

00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,210
numbers are variable so we're still

00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,560
trying to work out what would be the

00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:35,980
right algorithm for that because they're

00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:38,140
not worth the same you know three months

00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,000
of cats receivable and no cash it

00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,070
doesn't matter you know you're kind of

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,600
screwed and then that line of credit

00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,580
like we would never want to ever touch

00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,840
our line of credit but just kind of

00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,490
having that out there just kind of

00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,830
allows us to kind of worst-case scenario

00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,320
things and then in terms of our runway

00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:56,260
you know for us 20 person shop being

00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,660
fairly conservative fiscally you know we

00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,910
try to have at least six months of work

00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:04,810
lined up in terms of support and active

00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:06,820
projects and then I'd say another well

00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:09,100
not 6 i'd say like four months six would

00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,200
be awesome but again like it's this if

00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,400
there's a balancing act between amount

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,620
of work that we have under contract

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,860
versus what's in the sales pipeline you

00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:19,180
know and those kind of go up and down

00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,460
correspondingly i'd say probably like

00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,930
three to five months of work under

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,180
contract that we haven't touched and

00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:27,610
then another like three to six months of

00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:32,320
stuff that's in the sales pipeline so it

00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:33,460
makes sense cool all right not only give

00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,190
us just like two minutes to three

00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,630
minutes for questions you guys have any

00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,700
questions or feedback or stuff that

00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:45,340
we're totally missing here that means

00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:49,450
our business sucks what's up that's a

00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:52,420
great question we don't practice open

00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:55,000
books because I think to practice open

00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,400
books takes a level of maturity in your

00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,100
management style that like if you open

00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,160
books done wrong is catastrophic you

00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,320
know so we in our organization we have a

00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,870
we have a what we call our small Council

00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,030
it's it's our kind of director level

00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:12,130
folks is plus a couple other folks who

00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,860
kind of like have operational roles and

00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,970
with those folks we're very trans we're

00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,950
transparent on top line numbers and

00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:21,250
bottom line numbers some of the stuff on

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:23,620
salary we've been slow to kind of roll

00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,090
that out you know it's a new thing to

00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,220
press have a middle management structure

00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:29,110
so we've again like just wanted to make

00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,540
sure that that information is useful to

00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:33,070
those managers so we're kind of rolling

00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,720
that out and educating directors on how

00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:37,360
to make salary you know hiring decisions

00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,700
you know being a team of 20 and having

00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,920
four directors and to sea level staff is

00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,630
a little bit overkill but it's kind of

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,780
like you know for us it's a future

00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,280
proofing thing so we're rolling it out

00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,359
but yeah I mean some shops do that

00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,060
everybody knows what everybody else

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,859
makes and I've heard of it being

00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:59,020
effective but like it can also get

00:57:53,859 --> 00:58:01,810
really miss confusing yeah I think the

00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:03,579
thing there that's tricky is like stupid

00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,079
developers get more expensive every year

00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:07,300
so it's like you know sometimes the

00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,280
raises are on a different schedule from

00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,660
like what you need because like you just

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,400
closed the deal you have to have

00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,750
somebody tomorrow and so you're

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,670
negotiating like it gets a little

00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,750
awkward sometimes if you don't if you

00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:26,320
don't have the time to tell everybody

00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:29,349
everything yeah you're a larger team to

00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,599
right yeah so yeah so you guys have some

00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:37,780
different things you're dealing with

00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:40,270
anything else what's that um well that's

00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:43,329
mostly in this sales pipeline Oh like

00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:45,369
actual lead gen we we're you know we're

00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:47,859
just that's an area where I need to

00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:50,680
focus this summer like we I don't have

00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:52,359
great metrics on that you know we're

00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,920
starting like once a quarter to do

00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:58,180
that's an area where we're iterating

00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,010
really quickly like win loss rates stuff

00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,780
like that it's also an interesting one

00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,150
like marketing dollars like what month

00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,710
of revenue should be tracked against the

00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,119
marketing dollars to know how effective

00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,589
they are because obviously the marketing

00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,970
you do this month is not the revenue you

00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:13,780
make this month so trying to figure that

00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:15,849
out if folks have ideas on this and have

00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,260
other templates I'd love let's share

00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:19,270
them over Twitter and let's keep a

00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,250
dialogue going because I don't know what

00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:26,220
the right answer is there we're still

00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:26,220
playing with it what's that

00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:48,140
yeah that we have a different

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,730
spreadsheet like I said like we're

00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:53,750
exploring whether or not forecast app

00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:55,369
could replace it but we have just a big

00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,349
spreadsheet that is every staff person

00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:59,420
every project they're working on all the

00:59:57,349 --> 01:00:02,089
unassigned work for each different

00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,559
project and by different category and we

01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:06,559
kind of we just horse trade with that

01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:08,839
the project managers love it it's it's

01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,630
it's it's very it's a very crude tool

01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:14,839
like there's just a lot of you can it's

01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:16,609
prone to user error but it's the best

01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:18,079
tool we could come up with we have a we

01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:20,660
have a resource allocation meeting every

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,700
week and then every other week we have

01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,260
an ampm account management project

01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,569
management meeting and so we're

01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,369
constantly just trying to it's it's very

01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:33,619
manual unfortunately I wish that it

01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:38,289
wasn't no well it's all fixed it's all

01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:38,289
timing materials not to exceed yeah

01:00:49,920 --> 01:01:02,680
yeah yeah it it plays into it keys off

01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:04,839
of this billable hours matrix to try to

01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,310
understand what are reasonable what are

01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:08,829
reasonable commitments we can make based

01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:11,380
on staff you know and that's something

01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:14,740
to like PTO debt is an interesting one

01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:17,290
to you know people don't take people

01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,880
earn you know four point six hours of

01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,530
pto every single week but they don't

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,079
take four point six hours every week so

01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:27,240
that's another thing sorry I haven't

01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:29,829
turned on that's not me so we have a

01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,180
yeah so that's another kind of we do it

01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:33,250
in our P&L report at the end of the

01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,760
month like if we've made a ton of money

01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:38,950
in a given month but nobody took any pto

01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,300
then you know that's great from a cash

01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:43,300
flow perspective but we're accumulating

01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,859
PTO debt like technical debt that comes

01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:49,450
up down the road you know typically

01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:51,579
December or whatnot so yeah so that's

01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:54,490
and zenefits actually has some decent

01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:59,530
reporting on that that kind of helped

01:01:54,490 --> 01:02:03,359
out a bit so cool anything else we are

01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,359
over on time yeah

01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:10,099
maybe I need to change the access

01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,099
