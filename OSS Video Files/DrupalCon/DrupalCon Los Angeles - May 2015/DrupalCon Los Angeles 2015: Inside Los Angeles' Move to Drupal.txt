Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Inside Los Angeles' Move to Drupal
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In this session, we will showcase the City of Los Angeles project to transform their existing government service sites into a manageable Drupal based platform. We will show how this project tackled major goals of internal maintainability, repurposing existing data sources, and minimizing disruption across a diverse range of departments and sites.

As part of any complex city government migration, many technical and political hurdles need to be overcome. Some highlights that will be discussed include:

The background of the project and historical infrastructure.
The planning and agile development process, and collaboration between the Los Angeles internal technology team and development partners.
Development of a common city-wide site platform.
Cataloging back-end data sources and planning integration points and approaches.
Supporting data feeds of various types from multiple sources.
Creating streamlined interfaces for content managers who are not Drupal developers.
Coordinating training of staff to become Drupal content managers.
Choosing a hosting and deployment platform to ensure reliability, performance, and a source controlled environment.
Baking accessibility into both the site and editorial tools.
