Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Inside Los Angeles' Move to Drupal
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In this session, we will showcase the City of Los Angeles project to transform their existing government service sites into a manageable Drupal based platform. We will show how this project tackled major goals of internal maintainability, repurposing existing data sources, and minimizing disruption across a diverse range of departments and sites.

As part of any complex city government migration, many technical and political hurdles need to be overcome. Some highlights that will be discussed include:

The background of the project and historical infrastructure.
The planning and agile development process, and collaboration between the Los Angeles internal technology team and development partners.
Development of a common city-wide site platform.
Cataloging back-end data sources and planning integration points and approaches.
Supporting data feeds of various types from multiple sources.
Creating streamlined interfaces for content managers who are not Drupal developers.
Coordinating training of staff to become Drupal content managers.
Choosing a hosting and deployment platform to ensure reliability, performance, and a source controlled environment.
Baking accessibility into both the site and editorial tools.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090
so at the city of Los Angeles we

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:11,849
embarked upon migrating our entire web

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,660
content management system to to Drupal

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,100
so next slide but before we go into that

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,449
let me tell you about the city of Los

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,320
Angeles to give you a little bit of idea

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:27,240
of an idea of our challenges so we can

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,720
see yeah so we have a very large square

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,550
footage in our city and at the same time

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,640
we do have a very distributed IT staff

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,559
so although I work for the ITA which is

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,440
a centralized IT department there's

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,840
about 40 plus departments that have

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,579
their own IT staff so it gets pretty

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,200
unwieldy when it comes to trying to

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,469
implement some pretty large you know

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,530
enterprise type systems and so 485 of

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,239
the IT staff of the 1200 are in the

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,719
central IT agency which is the

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,120
department I work for and over 40,000

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,100
city employees are are the number of

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,439
people we have to serve internally aside

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,369
from serving the 4 million residents of

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,760
the city so in addition to having that

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,850
big of a user base we have had forty

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,490
percent staff reductions since 2008 so

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:23,189
our service levels it says here no

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:26,250
change but actually it's increased so so

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,140
pretty much we've had to focus on trying

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,380
to deliver services online and of course

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,450
we try to figure out who our users and

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,920
pretty much people who are interested in

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,869
city government are people who we need

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,509
to serve online also residents

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,869
businesses visitors the usual but we

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,520
also saw that there were a lot of

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:47,130
investments in systems that cater to

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,439
jobseekers because we wanted to help in

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,600
I guess getting people jobs in the city

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,030
of Los Angeles which we saw is a very

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,009
very important user base at least in our

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,909
web statistics so that actually got a

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,920
special mention here

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,469
so yeah as I mentioned our goal is to

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,229
replace our legacy CMS we had snow any

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,360
people here have heard of snomint Wow

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:11,720
okay cool for my son you need protein

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,730
from us but pretty much it was a system

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,890
that required our users to use IE 7 and

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,660
with XP I know pretty old i could see

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,640
some painful you know it was really

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,370
painful for us and we had a lot of our

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,590
users internally jumping ship and it ran

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,629
on microsoft server 2003 and pretty much

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,340
we were doing a lot of workarounds to

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,830
get people to use that system it was a

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,629
fairly cheap system and our our

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,849
management liked only spending like 25

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,410
thousand dollars a year for 40 websites

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,590
which is the number of websites that my

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,549
group maintains but it had to end

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,890
because of IE 7 and like i said we were

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:47,360
40 plus and then because of the number

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,810
of people leaving us we were down to

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,760
like 20 websites so what mattered to us

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,940
we definitely wanted to who are going to

00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,680
ask management to invest considerably in

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:02,060
something more than 25,000 we had to lay

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,400
out our criteria what would make it

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,049
successful in the city and so our end

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,549
users it was very important because they

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,989
would basically have to evangelize were

00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,220
very distributed there's actually

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,810
competition within the city of Los

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,430
Angeles so a lot of our elected

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,109
officials a lot of our departments were

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,730
actually going open source WordPress

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,940
they were doing all kinds of things so

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,560
in a way there's kind of internal it's

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,209
some kind of internal competition so we

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
wanted our end users to be happy if

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,639
they're happy then they'll start

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,919
speaking about it and they'll say hey we

00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,870
love I t's solution for us we want to go

00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,940
with them so aside from that they were

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,859
demanding a lot of features and we like

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,750
I said we had to do so much to just

00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,819
customize even just a little bit for

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,829
very basic features that's out of the

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,329
box and a lot of these new solutions we

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,010
also needed high-availability we're at

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,209
ninety-four percent availability when

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,890
actually we should be at like

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:49,420
ninety-nine point

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,969
cost-effective obviously we had cuts and

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,939
people they wouldn't want to pay for a

00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:57,730
lot for technical solutions either and

00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,760
so we also wanted departments who were

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,739
doing stuff on their own to be able to

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,420
have also access to a system that we

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,129
maintain so that they could enable them

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,599
also to use the system so we wanted to

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,980
support different levels of users not

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,859
just the non-technical users but also

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,689
developers and of course we didn't want

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:15,189
to be stuck with something that for the

00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:20,410
next 10 years that wouldn't grow with

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:23,470
the web so that was our criteria so we

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,030
chose Drupal because it's free highly

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,860
functional a lot of stuff is out of the

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,410
box very innovative I mean I've been

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,240
following Drupal development and I've

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,060
been itching to get on to Drupal for the

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,539
longest time or something similar to

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,759
Drupal but definitely even before us we

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,259
saw City of Austin Bart definitely get

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,050
on Drupal and they had a lot of success

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,759
stories they were to give Austin won

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,680
best of web and we were itching to get

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,539
to that level too but those competitions

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,729
definitely show who's being innovative

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,960
what are they're using and basically

00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,909
what I've been thinking presenting to

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,800
management I was able to let them see

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:58,599
that hey this is a direction that

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,449
everybody else is going to and so it was

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,710
a easier sell than it was years ago when

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,159
we didn't have a lot of these digital

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,720
leaders using Drupal just yet but they

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:09,460
had I guess the flexibility their

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,010
smaller the city of Los Angeles would

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,240
have to be investing a little bit more

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,889
money and of course they didn't want to

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,970
just jump into it unless there was some

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,070
proof that it was going to be successful

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,650
and of course we needed enterprise-grade

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,780
system and support and years ago they

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,659
didn't have Drupal didn't seem to have

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,039
that just yet for cities large as ours

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:31,320
to be comfortable and going enterprise

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,320
wide with with an open source system

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,459
alright so I'm going to talk about the

00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:50,159
solution that we actually implemented

00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:53,089
and I'm going to start with hosting and

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:57,599
all of the tools that we decided to use

00:05:53,089 --> 00:06:00,059
so our solutions the main one is aqua at

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:04,289
cloud site factory and we also use

00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:08,219
github JIRA base camp goga hangouts and

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:11,459
slack and so for not sure is anyone you

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,709
slack before yeah awesome for team

00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,779
communication so that's why we use most

00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:18,479
of our real time like throughout the

00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,219
project we did Google Hangouts because

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,659
we're a very distributed team so we use

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:26,399
that for all of our face-to-face scrums

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,409
base camp we use for our asynchronous

00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,679
communications where we put our project

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,689
files that kind of stuff JIRA we did for

00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,939
agile which was another big part of this

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,259
project is not only implementing the

00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,099
solution but is also training and

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,099
enabling like the agile process we use

00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:45,479
github for all our code management

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,089
individual developer or developers had

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,189
Forks and then they do feature branches

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,569
and then they do pull requests and where

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,589
we could review them and then merge them

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,929
in and then Acquia cloud site factory

00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:02,610
was like our main like the platform that

00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:05,399
we built the solution on so site factory

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,719
if you look at it basically what it is

00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,669
is a interface for a multi-site and so

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,079
with the interface you can on the

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,179
individual site level you can go ahead

00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,259
and you can clone sites and delete sites

00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:21,179
and create new sites there's like single

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,739
sign-on built in so you can sign in to

00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:25,110
all of your sites without having to go

00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:30,839
remember login and passwords and that

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:33,209
kind of stuff yeah it's built on top of

00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:38,759
aqua cloud so it's high availability

00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:40,619
it's completely scalable everything yeah

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,449
I mean if there's any issues it's got 24

00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:45,850
7 critical support

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,870
also on the admin you've got like a

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,539
single interface where you can manage

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,370
code you can deploy new code you can

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,509
create tags to deploy to production

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,250
environment it controls or it supports

00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,570
user roles so you can put users in

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,759
certain groups and they can only access

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,410
certain sites and so for their needs

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,030
having different departments and then

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,740
different levels of users it just kind

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,990
of worked out really well fit exactly

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:15,289
what they were looking to do so creating

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,610
a common platform so we're going to talk

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,910
a little bit about like development

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,210
process data architecture theming setup

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:27,289
and content management so for the

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,180
development process the main deliverable

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,000
for me was an architectural document

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,130
which was about 60 pages and it was more

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,659
about maintenance and moving forward and

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:40,159
how to keep developing on top of the

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,740
platform we did two weeks prints for the

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,180
first well for the project timeline so

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,490
for the first five months of his civic

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,260
actions and myself doing most of the

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,779
development and then for the second five

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,800
months city of La was able to step in

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,480
and do a lot of their own development

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,300
work and then it was more of a

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,390
consulting role teaching them and

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,940
helping them get through issues every

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,620
development every developer had their

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,150
own fork and then they worked off their

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,250
own fork and then they got to learn how

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:12,080
to use git we taught la like the actual

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,480
agile process so then after the project

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,100
they could keep it going which they're

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,190
still doing every two weeks they're

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:24,580
starting a new sprint yeah Madeline

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,580
stuff

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:45,240
okay yeah we so one of the main features

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:48,940
that was important to LA also was a

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:53,170
responsive site and we have a responsive

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:57,700
navigation we the slide that you see up

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:59,170
there has control examples and if I had

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,540
a pointer would be a lot easier to do

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,280
this I make I could mention a little bit

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,620
about the background so yeah the city of

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,290
Los Angeles I have a team of six

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,390
full-time members and then for part-time

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,070
members and what we wanted to do is yeah

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,530
immerse ourselves in Drupal so that we

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,750
could become experts ourselves and then

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,340
migrate all those 40 websites that we

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,650
mentioned and one of the first things

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,480
that we asked civic actions and equity

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,460
to help us with is migrate our main city

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,490
website which award-winning we wanted to

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,890
make sure it was transferred over in

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,900
with expert help but at the same time we

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,600
needed to refresh the site and do stuff

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,750
that we had like for the longest time in

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,660
our backlog and so basically we came up

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,040
with LA City org as you see it here this

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,160
is a screenshot feel free to visit it

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,830
and yeah as was mentioned we needed to

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,430
make it responsive in addition there's a

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,640
navigation bar just within 10 months of

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:58,240
after installing or setting up Drupal we

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,280
migrated LA City org another site and

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,800
then we had a navigation convert top

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,650
that sits on every city website now

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,050
virtually every city website now and so

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,730
that's what you see from the very top if

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,640
you want to you want to go into other um

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:19,930
yeah some of the things we had here so

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:23,560
other other announcements which I can't

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:27,400
read things so yeah this is an

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:32,470
announcements feed that is managed in

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:37,710
Drupal the center part is more related

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:41,530
to city views programming but it is a

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,260
its content and so current and recently

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:47,139
archived media with indicators for if

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,239
anything is live or streaming

00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,910
council meetings board meetings things

00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:55,299
like that are streaming yeah so we have

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:58,089
we have a TV channel actually that lets

00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:01,179
people see programming we have like a

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,980
weekly magazine show we also have of

00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,739
course various committee meetings and

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,389
city city council meetings and what was

00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:09,639
important for us we have so much content

00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:12,040
but yet we wanted to let people see what

00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,149
was what's going on now so what's kind

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,100
of cool is there's a live and on-demand

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:20,019
indicators alive and on air indicator so

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,379
people going on to their going on to

00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,239
either the responsive site or the the

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,399
desktop site then they could basically

00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:29,079
see what's going on now so there's a ton

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,540
of content and we're like how the heck

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,519
do we make sure that people see what is

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,629
going on now because I think that would

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,859
be pretty cool plus at the same time

00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:42,669
people who are very engaged people want

00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:44,709
to know what what meetings are going on

00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,910
and also what events are going on they

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,730
can just go right to the home page and

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,739
find information that they need all of

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,519
that is from fees yeah yeah and those

00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:56,439
are all from feeds of external data

00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,419
sources that we've incorporated into the

00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:05,439
site we've also got a scrolling media

00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:09,249
bar with twitter feed there's links to

00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:13,269
all their social media accounts so they

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:15,009
are it's pretty much the front page is

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,899
kind of just an example of everything

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,339
that we did for the project who wanted

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,629
to be very dynamic we didn't want

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,759
anything static we wanted things

00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:23,290
updating constantly as soon as something

00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:29,230
was available we wanted to show it to

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:31,059
them so can move on in the data

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,809
architecture so we talked a little bit

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:39,100
about data architecture most of the

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:43,089
content on city of la's website was from

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,499
various external data sources on their

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:52,559
311 city services data shows up on here

00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:54,939
we we import that into Drupal recurring

00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,269
so that it's always up to date because

00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,499
that is managed in a different database

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,279
the

00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:07,319
on demand videos are from a Granicus

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:11,129
feed so those are actually updated in a

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:14,159
much more timely fashion up to the

00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:16,499
minute you know you can't have something

00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,459
update every hour when maybe it changes

00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:23,939
every 15 minutes the events calendar is

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:28,079
also from an external data source that

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:30,749
is still managed using the external data

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,569
interface we pull that in with feeds as

00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:39,539
well so that we can display it easily

00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:42,299
there are other feeds la ba VN job

00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,209
opportunities things like that all that

00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,639
stuff comes in using feeds in Drupal and

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,999
then it displays seamlessly inside the

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,449
website you really can't tell what's

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:56,099
being managed in Drupal and what's not

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:59,189
and so we did have to spend some time

00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:04,109
figuring out which of these things need

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:08,519
to be can be imported into Drupal have

00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:11,849
periodic updates may be Knightly versus

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,059
things that have to be retrieved pretty

00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:16,829
much dynamic and stored in a cache so

00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,659
that you're not spending a lot of time

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:24,629
on the main site looking for those

00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:26,099
things and and then determine we had to

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,889
determine an appropriate update schedule

00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:31,199
for all that content that was one of our

00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:36,779
first challenges and took quite a bit of

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:39,479
time on the initial project this is so

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,059
basically we had mostly contribs we

00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:44,939
didn't really have to do a lot of custom

00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,849
code for this which is speaks a lot to

00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:52,769
the power of Drupal and the community

00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:55,739
and all the great controls that are out

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,079
there most of our custom modules were

00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:00,509
features so configuration content types

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,199
things like that we really wrote a

00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:06,989
surprisingly small amount of real custom

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,199
code to support all the things that we

00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:09,199
did

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,589
we chose to use the feeds module to pull

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,860
in all of our data sources it's a really

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:22,490
powerful tool to help you manage mapping

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:27,949
between external sources and your drupal

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:31,550
source and it's it allows you to set up

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:33,889
periodic imports and Christian is going

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:47,540
to talk more specifically about what we

00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:48,889
did with feeds okay how many have some

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,860
familiarity or familiarity with the

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,060
feats of module currently good so a lot

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,519
of this is just going to be a little bit

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,180
of review but I'm going to run through

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,819
just a quick example here with some of

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,640
the power and things that were able to

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:05,870
do without a lot of customization a lot

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,539
of our data that was coming in through

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:13,069
LA City a lot of different formats but

00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:14,659
you know JSON XML CMS and this example

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,189
here is just a small snippet of some

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,780
JSON data that we would had coming in

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,949
from one of our event feeds so you know

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,490
anything from you know date formatting

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:28,069
sand things like that titles we we had

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,230
you know a lot of different other feeds

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,030
to deal with so the fuse module was

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,250
really key into integrating all of the

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:39,650
stuff and getting the content in without

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:42,169
a lot of extra effort so you know some

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,510
of the basic settings and things that

00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:48,830
you're able to get here or allow you to

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:51,710
do scheduling a periodic importing you

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,440
know setting up several multiple feeds

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,030
from different sources and this does it

00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,220
all in a really nice you know UI

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,140
interface it's it's not too hard to

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,909
teach to others which is the other thing

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,220
was great because we had to get there

00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:06,860
came into their transitioning them to be

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,360
able to run these imports and you know

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,980
know know where everything is that's

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,980
coming into their their data

00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:18,259
in this particular example here we had a

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:21,529
JSON parser so we would just be mapping

00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:27,710
all the fields coming into from our

00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:30,259
event data into named fields on the feed

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:35,259
side and once all of these things are

00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:38,240
mapped into this layer you're able to do

00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,070
to set up your note settings and things

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,559
so for you can map all of those fields

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,909
into where they going to end up in its

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,610
forest in Drupal nodes for note settings

00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:52,220
themselves this is important a lot of

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,049
the events we would want them if it was

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,429
event changes and other things that

00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,659
would happen there want to make sure

00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:00,830
those nodes would get updated

00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:03,980
immediately on the next import and pop

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,830
it up authoring information not having

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,749
any duplication of nodes and any other

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,490
content since we did have some

00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:12,289
collisions with other things is not

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,690
necessarily the same unique identifier

00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:16,460
us across all these things so that's one

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:22,399
thing that's really important with this

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:23,840
module and then for mapping itself's we

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,639
were able to just take the fields that

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,830
we need a lot of data we're able to

00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:33,950
throw away and then also set this up for

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:36,070
any other editing or transformations

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,179
that we need to do on this data itself

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:44,330
which leads you into the tamper so

00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:48,019
tamper was really important here taking

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,909
care of any other date formatting taking

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,230
a date and putting it into you know

00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:56,809
Drupal actual date you know feel

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,730
formatting and and not losing anything

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,789
and still having it you know all our

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,889
views not be maintained and everything

00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:06,049
and it also led us to be able to do any

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,330
customizations inside of a custom module

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,820
if we needed to you know transform any

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,019
of that data in some particular way like

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,019
we were matching things up with other

00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,789
videos and just other other data that

00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,889
would need to be paired together that

00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,190
this couldn't necessarily take on by

00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,190
itself

00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:29,450
and then I think we're leading into a

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,490
presentation of the data itself of what

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:37,159
we were able to do once we got this vide

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:38,450
atta imported yeah I'm going to pass it

00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,880
on this Stefan she was going to give you

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,840
a little example here of what we were

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,269
able to do with some of that data yeah

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:52,580
so this is the main page of the four

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:56,870
residents section and so the city events

00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:00,980
pull events that were tagged that were

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:07,429
for city residents and so that shows you

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:10,010
the current day's events and the other

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:16,010
thing that's on here off to the side is

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:21,250
a this menu over here is a taxonomy

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:26,380
driven menu but it pulls the 311 data in

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:29,870
from the city services and so these are

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,159
these are links to city service pages of

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:39,380
the data the information that is

00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:41,750
important for city residents to see this

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,389
is a little this is not in the LA City

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:49,370
site this is actually on LA city view

00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:53,480
this is their old weekly schedule for

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:55,190
the channel 35 on-air programming you

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,260
click on one of these and you just got a

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,500
little little blurb that didn't say much

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,649
more than what was right there this is

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,840
what we have now so you have a weekly

00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:08,380
program schedule you get what's

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,389
currently on air right now a big picture

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:17,960
you can click on that and get more

00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:20,210
information sorry below you see what's

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,980
coming up for today they now have

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:28,039
descriptions those weren't available on

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,070
the website before the city the content

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,610
editors are doing no more work than they

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,640
were before two

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,500
up the TV schedule but they're able to

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,710
get a lot more use out of the web

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,390
content we've got different views so

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:48,220
they can display this in different ways

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:51,490
if they want and it's really increased

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,150
the amount of value they get out of the

00:22:51,490 --> 00:23:02,080
work they do to create their schedule

00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:03,130
and I think this goes to Jason so real

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,510
quick we're just going to talk about the

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:09,190
demon strategy it's just basic drupal

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,450
theming really we started with the zen

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,540
based theme something that was very

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,750
clean everything was custom but it was

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,090
really a pixel to pixel translation of

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,240
their old site to the new site with the

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,000
addition of responsive in there we did

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,940
use a separate github repo for a theme

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,380
and then we had for each different site

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,880
that we made we had a different branch

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,929
for that theme and then we could connect

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,770
those into a site factory and then

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:41,620
deploy themes separately everything's

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:44,590
organized based on smacks we're using

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,419
sass and compass while enabling and

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,220
training la team they got to learn all

00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:50,830
those cool things and using smacks

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,360
really helped them spin up quickly

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,559
because they didn't have to go hunting

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,710
for code they could just find the

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,419
correct partial fairly quick and at the

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,720
theme level we're doing as much 508

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:03,760
compliance as we can because being

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,640
government site it's very important that

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,190
we do everything with accessibility in

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,200
mind this is just a screenshot of the

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,960
accessibility module so we were able to

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,850
go in and create define rules and then

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,010
we could incorporate that into our

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,919
WYSIWYG so then as they were creating

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,960
content and adding images they could run

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:31,210
accessibility scans and checks on that

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,010
piece of content itself for the content

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,980
itself is about forty thousand pieces of

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:40,030
content most of it was migrated in

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,590
through feeds or other sources again the

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,410
accessibility was built right into the

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,310
WYSIWYG so when they created new content

00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,770
we can make sure

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,660
because bad things happen when you're

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:54,860
not accessible I guess that's what they

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:57,260
tell me they get sued and same thing

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,510
with the media so with the images we

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,730
were able to bake in a lot of the

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:07,550
accessibility stuff for alt tags title

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:09,200
tags got single sign-on to log into all

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,910
the different sites and manage all the

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,590
content because when you have three

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,300
sites it's not a giant problem but when

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:20,630
they have 50 sites it's going to become

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:22,430
an issue so one of the big goals of the

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,070
project was being able to actually hand

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,780
off the project so we started it and we

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,660
work together and we built something but

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,070
we really wanted the LA City team to be

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,500
able to take that project and run with

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,450
it so we created two or three sites and

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,530
then we hand it off to them and they can

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:42,260
create another 30 40 50 sites or 4000

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:45,170
sites whatever they want to do and so

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,080
doing that we had to take these this

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:52,160
group of guys that were very technical

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,310
but they weren't jubilous and so we did

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,290
that in a couple different ways I was on

00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,270
site a couple different times a couple

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,510
other people from Okwe went on site a

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:04,280
couple times and gave workshops you know

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,560
our documentation was very focused on

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,010
how to keep building not what we built

00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,720
and we would do these weekly hour-long

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,510
google hangouts where they would just

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,950
hammer me for I mean question after

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,160
question about stuff that I couldn't

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,020
even figure out half the time started

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,240
off easy how to create a view and it

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:27,620
ended in things like where does this

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:31,040
feed source come from so on site working

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:33,740
sessions they were amazing because they

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,350
were extremely flexible I went there for

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,010
two or three days and I got to work with

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:43,610
their team leads and all we did was work

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:48,380
through workflow process merging code

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:50,180
deploying code how to roll back code you

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,860
know we focused on some Drupal stuff but

00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,500
more of it was like very big picture

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,440
like how to manage like this project

00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,820
going forward workshops were a little

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,950
more structured

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,690
to keep the schedule fairly loose so we

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,490
can kind of dress questions as they came

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,649
up and it was more like all right the

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,259
topic for this morning is going to be

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:11,450
display types and then that could go out

00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,429
that could spider into like a different

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,190
topic and then you know at the end of

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,570
the day we were talking about things

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,190
that weren't even on the schedule i mean

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,320
like we were doing how to build a custom

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,519
module and custom module was never even

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,590
like on the schedule I think the

00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,179
workshops we did a like a site factory

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,789
jump start and then we did like a site

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:35,740
building one and then I came in and we

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:38,330
did a week-long like how to theme a site

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,570
architecture document kind of hit on

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,490
that earlier it's about 60 pages and

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,539
it's all like it encapsulates everything

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,830
in the project like how to deploy code

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,720
you know the different layers of caching

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:54,590
because there's like varnish and there's

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,049
memcache and drupal caching we

00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,970
documented like each function of that

00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:01,220
was in the custom modules so they can

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,690
maintain it or they can figure out you

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,399
know they can read the document along

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,440
with the code and kind of figure out how

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,730
it worked so then they can work on

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,590
creating their own or at least

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,710
maintaining or modifying what we had

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:15,200
already done we talked about get things

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,600
like patching and you know creating a

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,789
patch and applying a patch and you know

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,830
submitting a patch and then we also

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,539
talked about upgrading and how to going

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,039
forward how to update your modules and

00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:27,470
how to upgrade your sites and then how

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,299
did you know upgrade and test and you

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,009
know staging environment and then if

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,909
everything is good how to deploy that

00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,710
code to production and then knowledge

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:39,620
transfer sessions which I think was

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,440
probably the biggest like beneficial

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:45,590
thing that we did in terms of training

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,929
because it would be an hour long google

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,200
hangout and it would be me and probably

00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:53,720
six or seven developers and all they do

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,210
is ask me questions and questions were

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,850
everything like what does this code do

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,409
or where do I look for this code or I've

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,480
got this issue assigned to me right now

00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:04,399
and I don't know how to solve it can you

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,110
help me and then we would just walk

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,669
through like the actual problem that

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,090
they had

00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:11,499
until we got to the solution at the

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,480
beginning the questions again we're

00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:16,179
super easy at the end I would have to

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,309
tell them I'm not sure but I'll look it

00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:23,289
up and I'll get back to you tomorrow so

00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:25,269
that takes us into the retrospective I

00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,919
think we can probably do this one

00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:39,850
sitting down since we're all going to

00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:41,440
talk Madeline you want to go first so I

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,590
have a lot of notes here a lot of

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,210
successes so definitely what I felt was

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,889
very successful about the project are

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,989
the fast milestone completions I mean

00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:52,119
we've never accomplished this much in

00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:55,119
such such such a short time with

00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,279
especially with changing specs in 10

00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,960
months we were able to establish the

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,669
city's Drupal platform for multiple

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,649
sites so I mentioned that my group

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,419
maintains probably like 40 30 to 40

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,309
websites at a time but in the city

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,109
there's actually up to probably 200

00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,429
websites i know there's 100 at least and

00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,049
probably a hundred more that I don't

00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:13,419
know so definitely we wanted to

00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:15,399
establish a platform that could where

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,679
everybody else could benefit from the

00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:19,720
platform we wanted to train city staff

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,109
within that amount of time and as you

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,399
heard from Jason Lee there was a lot of

00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:28,299
hand-holding that he was our like

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,980
training meals and so we're worried by

00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:32,999
the time you know the end of the

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,619
engagement only in the beginning only me

00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:39,429
but it was it was really great to have

00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:43,210
all the support and planning the type of

00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:45,940
enablement for us to be able to within

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,009
ten months beyond our own we adapted to

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,320
the agile project management methodology

00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:52,330
which is amazing in government you

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,580
rarely see that and where the first I

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,259
think of the entire city to actually

00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,749
adopt that and we're actually being

00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:00,570
asked to mentor other teams so that's

00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:03,190
that's how successful this project is

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,869
migrated enhance LA City or gets a huge

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,460
site I mean you heard about all the

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,620
feeds coming in it's almost like

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,080
asad LA City isn't really there it's all

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,000
EADS Drupal is the one putting it all

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,760
together and in a way that's that's true

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,650
and we had an open data platform

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,910
launched during that time and so that's

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,440
where all the feeds were coming for him

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,320
for a lot of the events and a lot of

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,390
other data so everything is like API

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,460
feeds web services and we needed

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,530
something like drupal to bring it all in

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,630
and make it look like it's all coming

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,060
from one site so we also launched and

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,820
redesign and stuff to touched upon

00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,070
earlier that channel 35 and I mentioned

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,930
that we have a cable TV channel with a

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,020
lot of great content but it wasn't being

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,640
presented well to the public and it

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,160
wasn't being put on LA City organs

00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,170
really well until now so that's channel

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,750
35 if you have cable you live in LA you

00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,370
can check it out and we were able to

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,020
develop and distribute a citywide

00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,720
navigation bar I touched a pint earlier

00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,040
but yeah with 100 200 websites all of

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,460
the departments are worried about is

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,690
that nav nav bar going to be highly

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,400
available so it doesn't bring down our

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,170
site it doesn't mess up our our site

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,580
interface and so that was something that

00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,220
was really cool and it has searched and

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:17,560
notifications so soon we'll be able to

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,060
send well develop a notification feed

00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,150
and if there's an emergency or if

00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,680
there's something that is really big in

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,570
the mayor's office let's say wants to

00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,040
announce that navigation bar is going to

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,320
have a pop-up underneath it's going to

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,850
appear on like the hundred to two

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,890
hundred websites in the city so that's

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:36,400
that's pretty cool and we see a lot of

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:41,230
opportunity for that in the future but

00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:43,870
I'll keep that to myself improvement so

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,250
I mean it was great working with

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,990
everybody but of course not everything

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,780
is one hundred percent perfect i mean

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,130
it's we're not in the utopia but i think

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,870
one of the things that we learned is

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,130
that i discovered that training maybe

00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,750
could have been scheduled at the start

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,660
with more time allocated for it i think

00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,860
you scheduled trading kind of in between

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,300
but i think we should have started off

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,970
from the get-go I think we would it was

00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,760
a little bit

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,190
because we didn't know a lot of the

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,960
terminology earlier maybe if we knew it

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,130
much earlier we could we could really

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,350
understand what everybody was talking

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,080
about even though we're technical the

00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,250
terminologies you know you just

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,480
understand it and pick it up right away

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,730
and understand whenever he was talking

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,290
about I felt that we should have

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,270
prepared well in advance my team should

00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,450
have prepared well well in advance with

00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,440
more detailed responsive design specs

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,820
probably took it for granted that oh

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,020
there's going to be some responsive

00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,690
design things out there it's just gonna

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,430
look really cool after it's all

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,960
developed but obviously we also had some

00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,410
we had some tweaks that we wanted and

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,510
and it would have been better to list

00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,810
those out in the beginning rather than

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:51,080
kind of see what was out there and then

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,550
have to customize it later and then more

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,920
time for quality assurance testing I

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:58,340
think it's sort of a change in pace for

00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,400
us so we didn't seem to a lot a lot of a

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,170
lot good amount of time because at the

00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,590
same time we were also training so that

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:09,500
was that's kind of lessons learned

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,780
future opportunities we we really want a

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,850
Migrator 20 to 30 sites that we have on

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,500
silent that's a must and I we're trying

00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,760
to do that within a year we want

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,460
departments to leverage the new city

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,080
platform we want to reuse a base

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,120
template so we're working towards that

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,910
and basically want to cut the

00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,940
development time in half if we can and

00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,290
then sites we want in other city

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,520
websites we want them to be able to

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,160
integrate with other systems just like

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,200
ours is able or at least it is able to

00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,500
integrate with so many other systems we

00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,420
want them to benefit from that as well

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,860
and pretty much it opens the door for us

00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,450
to develop more features that will

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,840
encourage user engagement will have more

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,070
time because now we didn't have to we

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,180
don't have to do all those workarounds

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,770
which we constantly had to do with our

00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,609
old content management system so there's

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:58,039
a lot of time savings that we

00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:58,039
see that'll give us future opportunities

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,509
so for me I don't know if we call them

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,470
successes but they're definitely

00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:09,150
highlights you know like as the

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,970
development partner Pacific actions were

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,460
amazing like I can completely trust them

00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,849
and I could offload so much of my work

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:21,420
to them because they did so well I mean

00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:25,739
Ethan's not here but Ethan was a giant

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:29,609
part of this team communication was

00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:30,450
fantastic like we could talk like he was

00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,430
one of those things where you can ping

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,049
somebody and be like hey I need 15

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,970
minutes of your time and then you're on

00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,440
a hangout you know a minute later and

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,819
you can talk through issues and like

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,039
help through deployment problems and

00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:45,690
this is probably like one of the first

00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:50,130
projects where it's like it's been

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:52,529
seamless between team yeah between

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,849
client partner everything like we we

00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:57,150
basically worked as a team we had one

00:35:53,849 --> 00:36:03,619
goal for the sports analogies and we

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:06,150
reach scored a touchdown and yes

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,380
improvements as Madeline said like we

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,180
probably could have got her team

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,539
involved sooner which would have

00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,190
probably helped us develop faster and

00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,880
they could also they would have been

00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:20,400
able to take over more work sooner and

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,509
yeah it have been great another thing I

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,549
had was oh my documentation fell behind

00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:28,529
because you know work kind of gets in

00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:30,089
the way and there's certain times ready

00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:32,249
to step in and do some development tasks

00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:33,779
and then if I could have shelved that or

00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:36,329
push that development task off to

00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:37,950
someone else then maybe I would kept the

00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:39,749
documentation up to date and then they

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:43,190
could have been learning sooner and they

00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:43,190
may have been able to jump in sooner

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:53,220
okay yeah some of our successes from our

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,770
viewpoint we thought you know I mean we

00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,750
had a great project owner and there was

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,270
a great working relationship between all

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:04,190
the parties I mean having a having a

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,690
project owner that was as engaged and

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,930
interested in what we were doing and

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,549
they learned so quickly it was it really

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:15,539
made everything great and everybody had

00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:17,160
a great sense of humor you know you're

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,530
all busy you're all trying to get stuff

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,210
done but we all had a really great

00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:27,539
working relationship we also did a

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,039
really good job with our estimation for

00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:31,619
the amount of work we could get done in

00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,579
a sprint so you know things didn't get

00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,220
pushed back and pushed back so that was

00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:41,190
you know that was a great thing there

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,440
was a lot of give and take when maybe

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,990
things would change a little bit and so

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,119
we were really good at working out our

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,770
differences and you know when additional

00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,109
feature request came in in the middle of

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:55,140
a sprint we were able to accommodate

00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,789
those or you know decide what we have to

00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:01,200
wait until the next time to do this so

00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:03,839
that was really great we really did get

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,130
a lot done in a very small project time

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,230
frame it was it was a really it was a

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,569
really great thing there was a really

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,700
good division of labor we I think we

00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:16,650
work towards everybody's strengths so

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,400
that you know the most amount of work

00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,960
got done in the least possible time and

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,880
for me this was my first time really

00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,039
working on a distributed project like

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,859
this I only joined Civic actions last

00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:33,299
year and this was my first civic actions

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:35,369
project and I thought you know the

00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:39,210
communications tools that we used were

00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:41,640
really great I felt just as connected

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,470
with people in time zones three time

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,599
zones away from me as I did when I

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,930
worked in a in an office with people

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,200
that I could throw spitballs at so you

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,950
know that was that was really great

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,510
Kristin do you have anything else you

00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,800
want to add for

00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:02,430
and maybe you want to do though I think

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,240
the agile process really showed shine

00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:09,810
here in this manner too we had Lizabeth

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,850
really was our project manager and she

00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:14,460
did an excellent job at coordinating the

00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,520
team and making sure we you know stuck

00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,750
to what we're supposed to be doing and

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:23,700
that was very helpful and then we also

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:25,680
had Steve Curtis on QA one thing as the

00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,990
most projects it seems to happen an

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,880
improvement area is that you know having

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,860
your QA tests it'd be a focus we we

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,100
really didn't get our QA test going as

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,140
well as we did until later on during the

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,480
process so it's definitely an area

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,440
improvement that almost every project

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,380
seems to encounter we had a little bit

00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,970
of scheduling you know we making sure

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,270
our data feeds and things that we had to

00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,650
work with being available early enough

00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,840
it's a little bit of challenge because

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:00,390
we were working with a lot of different

00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,910
departments who all operate on different

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,250
schedules and you know ensuring that we

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,300
can get the data in time because you

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,410
know you got to start figuring out how

00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,300
to get everything important and so I

00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:15,450
definitely would recommend nailing that

00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,670
stuff down as early as possible and we

00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,400
did not get it to implement any

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,460
automated testing which was a real

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,390
bummer and I definitely would put that

00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,309
on the

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:31,410
the beginning the to-do list for our

00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:34,200
next our next project I think that would

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:37,279
that's going to cover it and I think

00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,210
we're going to open up to Q&A here if

00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:41,210
you want has you questions for us

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,490
you

00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,869
yeah so our accessibility focus more on

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,690
section 508 so there's a legal compliant

00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:06,800
of making sure that the website can be

00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,690
you know accessible by screen reader

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,910
when it comes to diversity in the

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,440
different languages that has been

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,190
something that we've been considering

00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,390
but then we do have let's say Google

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,980
Translate and that's something that we

00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,440
could put there we're still working it

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,330
out with our legal team to see if that's

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,369
something that you know not human versus

00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,810
machine translation but city clerk is

00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,140
promising because city clerk has already

00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:35,089
adopted the google translate yeah so we

00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,190
just have to look into whether that's

00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:39,530
grayleigh city door because we could

00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,970
translate it but then when we pretty

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,570
much linked off to a lot of other sites

00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,000
so from LA City it's it's we link off to

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,660
other departments sighs so the

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,570
translation won't be there once they

00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,770
leave the translation is gone so but now

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,770
we're working towards that as well

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,420
sure we were actually lucky the open

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,740
data initiative came directly from the

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,010
mayor's office so they actually

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,900
appointed a open data director and they

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,370
work directly with another team actually

00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,190
in high tea so there was a lot of

00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,200
resources already available and the

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,620
entire city basically each department

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,690
was asked to identify their open data I

00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,420
guess data that would that's good for

00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,310
open data and it was done it was done

00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,880
really quick probably within just six

00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,350
months departments were were mandated by

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,180
the mayor's office so it helps to come

00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,380
from above so they had the luxury of

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,990
having that vacuum from the mayor's

00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,340
office our redesign of LA City org

00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,260
actually in going Drupal was pretty much

00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,200
a grassroots effort my team and I we

00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,690
really had to put together very

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,120
compelling numbers and a use case to

00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:11,110
even group will go open source and and

00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:13,240
even you know my grade and give the idea

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,760
of migrating 100 to 200 websites onto

00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,310
one platform so I know I kind of strayed

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,650
from it but open data pretty much that

00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,060
went much more smoothly when it came to

00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,680
getting everybody on board with open

00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:29,110
data I have another question about the

00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,060
feeds since you're taking some data from

00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:33,960
the public sources like Twitter do you

00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,960
do any curation

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,530
so we have a distributed model as well

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:42,230
for our content for communication so

00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,200
Twitter feeds the Twitter feeds that we

00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,390
have actually are it's it's a

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,220
compilation of all City Twitter feeds so

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,940
we expect departments to do the curation

00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,890
and so really what we're only putting on

00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,090
LA City org is something that they are

00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:20,090
already curating it's either their

00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:24,310
tweets or their retweets so most of the

00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:27,740
feeds pull into drupal nodes so if the

00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:30,170
feed source goes down we're not really

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,080
displaying the feed source we are

00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,240
displaying the drupal node so for those

00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,860
feeds the biggest problem is well maybe

00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,160
the updates aren't happening quite as

00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,130
often as you want for the other one for

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,990
the up-to-the-minute things that we

00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:47,660
really aren't using feeds for but it's

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:51,980
more of a custom code to pull in the

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:54,440
feeds we pull them in out of band so

00:44:51,980 --> 00:45:00,920
there's a cron job that runs to pull

00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,900
them in there cached locally if that the

00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,930
next time the cron job comes along and

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:09,140
the source doesn't happen then what you

00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:12,170
get is stale data but you don't get no

00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,670
data so there were pros and cons we had

00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,040
to consider I mean right now we're

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,750
looking at one of our feeds we wanted

00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,270
more real time and we have actually our

00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,620
301 data they're moving into a CRM and

00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,630
they're asking us rather than giving us

00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,250
a JSON feed they're saying well so we

00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,270
don't have to maintain a JSONP can you

00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:30,860
can you just use our new systems API and

00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:32,180
where I'm trying to see what the pros

00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,110
and cons are they have to tell me that

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,630
they're going to be available all the

00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,100
time or something otherwise we'll go

00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,440
back to the problem we had when

00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,150
stellen when they were down our site

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
went down or the pages were blank so

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,060
definitely there's there some

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,980
give-and-take we have to consider what's

00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,570
key data that really shouldn't go down

00:45:45,980 --> 00:46:08,330
and if that's the case then we need to

00:45:47,570 --> 00:46:10,190
cash it curiously are there other design

00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:18,230
guidelines or anything else that is

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:20,150
going to be why they're so my team we're

00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,520
working on a style guide actually um

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,170
yeah so it's coming down it's just a

00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,000
matter of is this going to be a mandate

00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,400
or is this going to be an option or very

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,900
compelling option for you guys so but

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,360
it's we're working towards standardizing

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,670
that and providing again responsive

00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,280
design style guide and templates so that

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,080
it'll be easy for a lot of the IT shops

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,790
to be able to stand up their own website

00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,800
whether it's on Drupal or they have to

00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,420
you know neighborhood councils have to

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,460
do it on their own at least there's a

00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,360
resource that will make it available and

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:52,010
would identify with the Pacific we're

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,230
working with the mayor's office and so

00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,000
far our goal is to have it ASAP and test

00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,700
it with a few pilot sites and we have a

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,520
few volunteers so we're still working

00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,830
out the strategy of how to deploy that

00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,310
but essentially you're the answer to

00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,310
questions yes

00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:29,010
and they're changing yeah so again we're

00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,020
working with the mayor's office I mean

00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,360
with open data that model was pretty

00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,460
successful I mean it's not sort of a

00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,780
mandate but it's in a way and it's

00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,030
totally different I mean open data it's

00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,120
just putting a bunch of data you're not

00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:44,640
asking them to use a system as in-depth

00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,860
Lee as as you would Drupal but yeah I

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,630
mean what we're trying to do is win them

00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,370
over I mean we're not gonna even the

00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,420
mayor's office I they even know that

00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,740
they're going to meet a lot of

00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,150
resistance and sometimes with that

00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,730
resistance they won't it'll be

00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,820
impossible so what we're trying to do is

00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:02,130
lay out you know here is at minimum your

00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,740
the standards that your website should

00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,900
have and even with that list especially

00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,670
for government websites it shows that

00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,860
there's a lot of work that needs to go

00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:14,040
into developing a responsive design

00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,330
section 508 compliance especially for

00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,080
the number of checkpoints that we expect

00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:21,240
them to you know to have for when they

00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,260
go from a huge screen to just a tiny now

00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,540
watch i guess but definitely the way

00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,820
we're doing it is is showing them the

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,500
numbers pretty much showing them that if

00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,300
you were to go on your own and some of

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,580
them have experienced that and are

00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,490
actually coming to us so it won't be

00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,570
that difficult to sell for probably half

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,880
of the departments but for the other

00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,530
half who think oh look at how much

00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,580
especially if other contractors are

00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,800
coming to them and saying look how much

00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,180
I can do your site and it won't even

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,370
cost that much and I can do it in a

00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,780
month compared to with us when we tell

00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,850
them you're going to have to talk to

00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,320
your contractor and ask for all these

00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,450
requirements why don't you go back and

00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,620
tell them how much is that going to cost

00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:00,750
versus if you and how long it's going to

00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,850
take versus if you if you adopt this

00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,830
model and use a platform that's already

00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,840
there use a base theme that's already

00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,280
developed for them that's responsive so

00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,550
that's how we're that's our strategy

00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,420
it's pretty much competing competing

00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,480
with what's out there

00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,480
you

00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:29,230
yeah so we're going to decide based on

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,030
metrics or web analytics but at the same

00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,960
time we're also going to see but

00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:37,000
basically what is I guess hit the

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,020
heaviest because at some point we're

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,370
just going to have to turn off our

00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,230
system so we stopped paying for it if

00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,910
we're down to some sites that can

00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,980
actually be static like we can export

00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,180
export them then we'll do that so we're

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,410
going to start with the busiest website

00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,840
so it's kind of crazy that we went with

00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,670
Alisa they don't work first but that's

00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,740
how we plan on going about doing that so

00:49:51,670 --> 00:50:09,730
that maybe we can really shut it down

00:49:53,740 --> 00:50:13,450
our silence server within the year it's

00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:15,460
all basically just a JavaScript so I

00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,710
mean it's a little bit more than

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,410
JavaScript but the the output is

00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:23,440
JavaScript so the alerts feed is

00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:26,680
basically like a JSON file we're cashing

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,720
it we're displaying it but the actual

00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,450
menu item are all the menu items and

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,390
everything comes from another JSON file

00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:38,170
which gets pulled into so we just have a

00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:39,940
JavaScript file hosted at a cert and

00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:41,380
then if you're on Drupal there's a

00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,180
module that you just turn on the module

00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,250
and then you can pick do you want to

00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,540
load the you know the test source or do

00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,850
you want to do production version and

00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,330
then if you're not on Drupal then it's

00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:54,670
just attaches script to your website

00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:57,970
that's on LA City ordinary chase on

00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:00,940
using JSON for menu because we actually

00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:03,760
our menu is built off of our citywide

00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,040
services directory so that that taxonomy

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,900
that we have of that navigation is

00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,910
has a one-to-one relationship with our

00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,350
citywide services taxonomy which is in

00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,740
another database that's why it was built

00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,740
that way

00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,690
we use copy and paste for most of the

00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,609
content like if it could it be imported

00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,440
from a feed there wasn't really a whole

00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:34,589
lot of content that had to be migrated

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,510
and so it was copy and paste as opposed

00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:38,510
to setting up some kind of migration

00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,600
yeah I'm not actually sure we've got

00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:02,330
some really good migration people I'm

00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:05,240
not one of them but uh I can probably

00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:06,710
find out for you essentially what we

00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,410
were told is because we asked about that

00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,790
too we heard about you know the ability

00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,280
to migrate into Drupal there's this

00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,530
migration module and so he said well

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,970
wouldn't it be easy and they said pretty

00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,640
much there's a lot of setup and

00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,600
configuration if you don't have

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,280
something very structured if you don't

00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,750
have like Stalin is not database driven

00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,320
it's I mean our database the database

00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:29,930
for Stalin is pretty much indexes and a

00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,140
lot of the content is an XML so to

00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:35,840
configure that configure getting from

00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:38,240
XML and putting it into Drupal actually

00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,380
might take more time than and testing it

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,030
and then just making sure it works

00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,490
properly is more time than actually

00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,900
copying and pasting so there may be some

00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,840
websites that will have maybe over a

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,000
thousand a thousand pages with a lot of

00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,910
PDFs and all of that and we might end up

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,440
asking about the migration module but

00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,780
for a lot of our sites they're small to

00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,640
medium and we thought it was just faster

00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,740
to just do copy and paste and we would

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,510
engage also our end users to practice

00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,770
using Drupal and they would help us with

00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,770
the migration so that's the plan

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,440
yeah we did luckily though a lot of the

00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,050
city websites were pretty simple there

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,610
are only few and the only ones that had

00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,870
like the sticky headers you're talking

00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,460
about we're actually within their

00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,280
content management system so we had some

00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,230
WordPress people wordpress users saying

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,900
we lost our WordPress menu because of

00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,180
your navbar so well we would work with

00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,860
them one-on-one but luckily we're pretty

00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,770
lucky and we deployed it slowly we had a

00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,180
we did a survey and ask for ask people

00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,990
what their platforms were and then we

00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:09,730
selected them as their as the first

00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,780
pilot group but when we first told em

00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,030
can you test it for us they wouldn't

00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,910
test it so we said okay we would be see

00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,410
them I'm coming okay everyone away a

00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,670
little bit we beat would be see them and

00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,220
say we're deploying this they don't know

00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:23,440
who got destroyed got distributed to so

00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,940
these small group users would tell us if

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,190
there if there were some issues and we'd

00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,110
work on them 1101 so we deployed it

00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,850
slowly without them knowing yeah I think

00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,380
the goal was like you know we got it to

00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,790
work on maybe seventy five eighty

00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,280
percent of the sites and then there was

00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:38,050
always those use cases that you don't

00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,360
think about where it's like I have a

00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:42,970
site made out of frame sets or I have a

00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:51,030
site that doesn't have a body tag it's

00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:51,030
like they were really best viewed in ie6

00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,730
yes

00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,000
yeah no definitely the community was the

00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,920
deciding factor to one of the deciding

00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,350
factors because what I mentioned earlier

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,920
is we wanted things I would look ready

00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:28,080
out of the box and by far you know

00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,030
drupal just had all of these things out

00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,280
of the box through modules and so we

00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:34,680
were we were developing a lot of custom

00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,330
code workarounds like force talent for

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,790
example just so that the interface is a

00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,320
lot easier for the end user so i mean i

00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,780
can't wait for drupal 8 i kind of want

00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,520
to delay the project a little bit and

00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,710
get drupal 8 and then migrate the rest

00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,310
of the 20-plus sites that we have but

00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:53,010
definitely the community and drupal

00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:54,660
estas I mean would if not for the

00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:57,440
community wouldn't have all the modules

00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:00,270
in the core Drupal the way it is now and

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:04,980
and that was yeah definitely a big

00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:07,280
factor do awesome questions by the way

00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,280
yeah

00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:20,420
I'm sorry searching search oh how do

00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:22,910
things let's see we have in some sites

00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,070
where they're using google search but

00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:29,060
then on LA City we first launched it

00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:30,830
with just core search so uh yeah a

00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,500
couple of sites were using core search

00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:36,170
and then on other sites were using like

00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,690
Google site search for the city it's a

00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:40,940
Google Site Search pretty much like the

00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:44,470
global navbar uses Google Site Search so

00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:47,540
you can search across city website so

00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:49,190
google for now is it's free it's easy to

00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,790
set up and that's what we're doing so

00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:54,530
there's nothing beyond that maybe

00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,920
that'll be our next project maybe in a

00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,920
couple here

00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,080
yeah no that's a challenge it's still

00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,369
distributed departments are it's up to

00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,260
departments to put out the good material

00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:21,510
and of course there's a range of quality

00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,520
out there and so I know that the mayor's

00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:25,500
office is working to put together a

00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,330
working group they're calling it social

00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,430
media working group but actually it's

00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:31,349
it's really content the way I see them

00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:33,349
the scope of what they're putting

00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:38,460
together is really trying to get

00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:40,590
departments to be at a minimum minimum

00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,730
standard that the mayor's office pretty

00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,410
much is guiding so the mayor's office

00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,450
elected officials they're really good at

00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,010
putting together communications team so

00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,109
they're going to be mentoring a lot of

00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,849
the departments in this yeah so that's

00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:52,680
their strategies going to be parallel

00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:54,720
with our strategy in terms of

00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,099
infrastructure and putting a template

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,520
together so I think with that going

00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:01,140
together I think just that hand in hand

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,910
in a couple of years while you can see

00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,800
la just really improve its digital

00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:21,700
digital presence online

00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:23,470
there's a question back there I think so

00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,500
we're not using Drupal for records

00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:30,400
management for now we're just using it

00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,170
for user engagement I don't know if

00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,730
there's I don't think we have a policy

00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,280
at four records retention only for

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:39,880
certain things maybe contracts and maybe

00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:42,190
city council meeting agendas and and

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,430
stuff like that but when it comes to the

00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:48,600
web web sites we don't have any records

00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,600
retention policy just yet

00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,790
it's a bit early we're kind of waiting

00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:01,099
but no I'm excited I've been looking

00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:04,930
into what are the big differences

00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:07,010
between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 and yeah

00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:08,599
so far i'm looking at like the user

00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,240
interface how much how much more

00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:14,060
improved it is and so excited about that

00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:17,180
but yeah it's a bit early for us but as

00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,040
soon as I guess we're able to love to go

00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,780
to Drupal 8 especially if we don't have

00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,339
other sites migrated yet I think we'd

00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,280
rather do it sooner rather rather than

00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:27,170
later I don't know if there's any any

00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,420
recommendations when we should start

00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:40,520
looking but but i'm going to constantly

00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:43,430
