Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal 8 Media Status Update
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 Contrib Media Team is making good progress on our master plan for media handling in Drupal 8. We'd like to share what we've done so far, what is left to do, and how everything fits together into the vision we have for D8 Media. 

Specific things we'd like to have a conversation about with the D8 core and contrib developers:

How can we solve contrib library dependencies? We're using Composer for Drupal Core but we also include all of our external libraries in Core itself. Should contrib do the same?
What, if anything should we propose to improve the media handling support for Drupal 8 core before release? What could we include in the 8.x.x minor releases? What needs to wait for Drupal 9?
What needs have we not considered or need to meet?

interject with some questions that's

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
totally fine this should be more of a

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,670
back and forth even though it's more of

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,140
like a status update so feel free to

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,640
jump in with question I'll repeat it or

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,369

afterwards that you think of her I

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,689
didn't want to say hi tweet me i'll also

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
be at the lull about booth pretty much

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,890
the rest of the week so if you want to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,350
stop by and say hi so let's go ahead and

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,320
dive in a little bit you know a little

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,679
bit about me Dave I've been around in

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,120
Drupal for 9 to 10 years now which makes

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,810
me feel really old

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,360
um but I liked a lot I'm typically known

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,519
as the module guy I have that reputation

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,370
I don't know if it's a good reputation

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,590
or a bad reputation but i think the

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,680
count of modules that I've maintained

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,829
had has definitely been over a hundred

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,709
recently that's not like actively

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:37,470
maintains just written I'm not actively

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,569
working at all hundred at a time but

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,310
I've definitely gotten involved in more

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,489
of the media stuff recently in the last

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,280
couple three four years ever since I was

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,950
working for palantir net we made a big

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,549
push to improve media handling that's

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,650
where the 2x branch of the media module

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,390
kind of started and we really pushed

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,569
forward we had a big sprint that we had

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,209
a week with with Aaron wind-borne there

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:05,220
who's no longer with us and I had some

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,200
powdered abs and some samak we adepts we

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,849
had kind of I mean a big push so I was

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
really fortunate to get into that and

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,500
kind of dive into that and be feel

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
responsible a little bit for it and it's

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,130
kind of evolved since then right now I

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,650
work for a lullaby as I kind of

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,599
mentioned with the booth we're a

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,549
full-service drupal design development

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,169
strategy firm and we're kind of proud

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,290
because we got named like the number one

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:31,319
web development agency by clutch I don't

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,829
think that matters a whole lot it's nice

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,139
to say that we're number one but we're

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,049
just we like hanging out so come down to

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,500
the booth if you want and as a moment of

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:46,620
personal pride this is my five-week-old

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:50,099
that I left at home Linus who also

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,540
shares my great looks at looking at code

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,230
this is pretty much how I look during

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,620
the day like when I see stuff like what

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,269
is that where did that come from who

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,560
wrote that he's it's just great he's

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,849
picked that up already and if my wife is

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
going to listen to the recording

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,349
afterwards I'm sorry you'll get all the

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,750
sleep this weekend up I promise because

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,410
she's at home with two kids now but

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,620
they're a blast and the fork it insured

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,740
of course and of course this just isn't

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,440
about me like we have this is a whole

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,750
team of the media people and it's not

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,550
just these five people as well although

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,160
we kind of consider these you know these

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,500
5 2 b's somewhat of the core team that

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,440
we're kind of pretty active and always

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,789
involved and we have lots of more

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,830
contributors we're trying to get more

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:43,110
new contributors and we've got google

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,970
Summer of Code students coming in we

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,470
actually have three projects with google

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,830
summer of code that are involving media

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,990
this year and will detail those a bit so

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,520
it's just really great like it's it's

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,259
not just one person we're trying to make

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,569
this this team this kind of initiative

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:03,810
kind of thing even though it's

00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:06,240
unofficial so yeah so let's just kind of

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:10,949
hit the overview of the plan we came up

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,960
with this plan at New York City camp we

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,240
got the the media maintained errs and

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,729
thus called maintain errs together in a

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,460
room in the same place and kind of lock

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,319
the doors in a boardroom and we wanted

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,729
to figure out you know we're both kind

00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,130
of doing this media thing but we're both

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,110
kind of competing in in doing different

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,639
things that are kind of the same how

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,759
about let's figure out what words are

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,199
common where do we interact what common

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,599
functionality do we have what can we

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,030
work on together as we look forward to

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:42,030
Drupal 8 so that maybe we can share some

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,070
stuff and we kind of we got the big

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,500
whiteboard and I grabbed it out and we

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,729
kind of realized there are some things

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,639
that we couldn't share and work on

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,530
together and so we came up with this

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,360
plan to move forward from that that we

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,759
want to have these more independent

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,380
components so if you use the media

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,990
module in Drupal 7 it's kind of like

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,509
this big module you know there's there's

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,830
file entity but media module like does

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,500
all this stuff it does the WYSIWYG

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,599
handling it does the browser component

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,360
it's just this monolithic component that

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,669
just is hard to support and ends up

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,340
being it's it kind of shows the

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,139
struggles that we've had in Drupal 7

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,099
supporting that so we wanted to kind of

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,990
break things up into smaller chunks and

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,550
that way we could reuse them like you

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,009
know someone could come along and use

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,560
the the browsing component or the

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,240
embedding component and we also want to

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,039
make sure that these were pluggable so

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,740
like they didn't just work for media

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,130
stuff

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,740
they could work for any entity in Drupal

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,310
which i think is a very important point

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,960
and helps keep us abstract enough and

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,120
keeps us on that goal like if we don't

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,569
think of everything in files or media I

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,470
think we're on a good track with that

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,250
but I mean that's where we're coming

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,630
from too so the components that we

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,819
decided on I kind of touch them a little

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,130
bit so there's embedding so there's I

00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:06,090
want to take this file and put it into

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,620
my body field that's one major

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,900
responsibility so that's embedding in

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,139
WYSIWYG it's not necessarily WYSIWYG it

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,360
could just be like an HTML tag that you

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,120
could use because I know that with

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,340
decoupled architectures you know WYSIWYG

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
may have a less important role too so we

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,419
want to make sure that we're still

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,039
supporting that browsing and selection

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:32,080
of items is another big component and

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,940
then storage like how do you actually

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,220
what's the lower level like what are you

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,990
dealing with are you doing with files

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,630
are you dealing with some muzzling

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,830
something more abstract so there's some

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,210
other smaller things but these are the

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,469
three main components that we really

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,389
like to focus on and this is like if you

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:51,370
think of this in media and file entity

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,349
terms you know media was the first two

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,650
and file entity was the last one the

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,710
storage so we're kind of breaking it up

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,870
into three parts instead of two if we

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,090
look at it that way and of course that

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,669
the the goals that we have from this

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,620
plan you know a lot more collaboration

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,599
we want to keep talking with all these

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,130
people that are interested in media thus

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,990
called maintains the media maintain errs

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,849
people that work with files entities

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,169
like we want everyone collaborating

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:19,840
together and working on these shared

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,009
components because it's it's nice

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,569
because we're already struggling for

00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,250
resources it's it would be great if

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,969
we're all working together on that stuff

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,710
I rather than trying to compete you know

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,479
it gives us more momentum we communicate

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,060
a lot more we communicate in public a

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,229
lot more you know with our plans and

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,990
that kind of stuff we give these kind of

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,560
presentations rather than them maybe

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,199
being sequestered secret roadmaps that

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,459
aren't shared or public we want to make

00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,630
sure that this gets out a lot more

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,779
because that way we can bring more

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,100
people in

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,360
more people can see what we're doing and

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,850
say hey that's cool i could build

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:58,459
something off of that so that's really

00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:00,920
important to us so the first big part of

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:04,370
this is we're going to go into embedding

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,339
and this is the entity in bed module and

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,899
this is like my favorite part I'm really

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,589
really proud of the work that's been

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,509
done by the team on this and I'm happy

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,249
to say that this is usable right now in

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:18,499
Drupal 8 and I know those several sites

00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:20,509
like using this module in production on

00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:23,149
Drupal 8 those crazy people are but

00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:27,079
they're doing it and this is definitely

00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:29,990
like pretty ready to go so the modules

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,059
pretty much ninety percent there we've

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,699
even back ported it to drupal 7 Devin

00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,079
Carlson backboard of that to Drupal 7 so

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,019
if you're interested in using this as

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,470
like an alternative to media was he wake

00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,910
handling you could try this out and

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,589
we've also improved improved some

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,829
usability of the display configuration

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,569
I'll show that with some screenshots we

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,180
do have some remaining tasks so the

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:55,490
selection of what to embed right now is

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,559
just a simple autocomplete field which

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,209
will see and we want to integrate with

00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,089
that with our other component entity

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,649
browser which is still being worked on

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:07,129
and we've also discovered that there's

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,600
like the the button creating a button to

00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,670
embed nodes and creating a button to

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,920
embed files there's also these like

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,920
concept of embedding and how to display

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,480
them that we can share on among other

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,470
things that we kind of want to abstract

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,800
so we're going to make that another

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,420
module called embed API and we just want

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,110
to look polished usability of that stuff

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,350
too I can't really go much further than

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,120
mentioning this terrific guy who's been

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,509
our google Summer of Code last year

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,370
student who worked on SD in bed and kind

00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,829
of has taken the lead on entity in bed

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,759
and done a really really great job so

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,860
thanks to him so this is the the basic

00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,829
like selection form for how to embed

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,540
something and so i'm going i'm inserting

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:53,449
a file and it just right now

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,100
autocompletes by the file name which i

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,139
recognized for most people isn't very

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,600
useful that's where we're going to swap

00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,800
in a more better selection component

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,360
if it's available so this is swappable

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,660
and it works four nodes all that kind of

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,880
good stuff and then the next step of the

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,680
form is you get to pick how you want to

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,259
display that item so you select it and

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,440
then configure how to display so with

00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:21,139
files you can pick from a file or image

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,110
field for matter so like here you could

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,759
pick just like an image style or you

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,180
could do a responsive image for matter

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,920
as well it's just ready to use and you

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,319
type in the alternate text if you want

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,540
to it's just this is all based on field

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,980
for matters which is kind of another

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,440
thing like we're trying to reuse things

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,329
as much as possible so rather than like

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,160
these custom ways to display things were

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,899
like hey it's a file why not just let

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,060
them use file for matters and image for

00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,029
matters they're already there just reuse

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,190
them and if you insert a node you can

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,310
use any kind of entity for matters that

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,440
kind of stuff and so this is an example

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,220
of an entity one I am inserting a node

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,319
called test article and I'm saying

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,490
display as the label and link to that

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:09,319
node so or you could have let render

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,870
that node completely in your body and it

00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:15,259
totally works out of the box you can use

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,600
the Drupal 8 quick edit links inside the

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:21,589
rendered entity it's really really great

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,949
it works really well and so I inserted

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:28,250
the picture of matt lauer eating cheese

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:30,470
and I can't really edit anything about

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,319
this aside from being able to edit that

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,569
again in the contextual menu so I can't

00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,250
like accidentally change it here in the

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,430
WYSIWYG preview which is really nice and

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,720
the new feature interpolate so I could

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,730
edit and go back and select something

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,350
else swap it out or change the way it's

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,290
displayed and it just works and that's

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,240
really great and kind of the

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,540
nitty-gritty of it is that we use a

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,949
custom tag called Drupal dash entity and

00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,949
there's just some really cool stuff in

00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:05,750
here so for example we have an entity ID

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:07,339
for but we also store the UID of the

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,050
file of whatever entity is being

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,939
referenced so when you deploy stuff all

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,720
your embedded content when your body

00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:17,370
fields will work

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,459
which is really nice and it even that

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,579
alternate text is just an alt tag alt

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,620
attribute like as normal and it doesn't

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,810
need any more conversion than that so

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,120
that's using these nice data attributes

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,160
jefita is presenting right now on like

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,560
the battle of the body field he just

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,949
goes crazy for this this is like his

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,350
perfect system and so I don't want to

00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:44,819
say it made it for Jeff but its its

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:48,990
benefit and then this is a little bit

00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:50,339
smaller you say if you don't if you look

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,680
at the slides you can see this but this

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,050
is how you configure a button for

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,449
embedding so it's a you pick an entity

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,000
type you can give it an image for the

00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:02,730
button to provide the label and you can

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,529
actually configure which displays can be

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,990
used so if you want to manually control

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,899
like I only want them to be able to use

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,519
responsive images or I only want them to

00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,250
be able to use the the rendered entity

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,180
format or you can have control over that

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,370
which is one of the recent things that

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,899
we've added and I think has been really

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,850
nice and so I mentioned that we're so

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,300
going to abstract some of the stuff from

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,040
the the entity embed into this embed API

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,649
that's one of our google Summer of Code

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,139
projects this year so the concept of

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,170
making a button that corresponds to

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:41,850
something like an entity or something

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,589
else and then has display plugins and be

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,910
willing to just select the display

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,980
plugins that's going to be in this

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,339
module and we're going to kind of reuse

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,009
it for stuff like embedding URLs so like

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,910
you paste in a youtube link and we want

00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:58,470
to be the de facto way to do that so

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,790
this is another Google similar code

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,129
project to out of the bat so if you

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,040
paste in a YouTube video we kind of want

00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,420
to kind of do the same thing we're not

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,519
going to use a custom tag but we're

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,649
going to use a link but maybe add some

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,779
custom attributes to that like how to

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,839
display it just as the HTML how it

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,910
embeds that kind of stuff and we also

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,309
want to support more things than just oh

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,740
in bed you should be able to provide

00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:26,490
some custom plugins and like provide

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,130
your own custom

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:32,670
like URL like oh I'm going to paste in a

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,350
drupal.org link and i'll put this HTML

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,770
and you could add support for people

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,839
that paste in urls and it would also be

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,080
nice we have on the road map for this

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,480
that if someone like pastes in a iframe

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,029
embed of a YouTube video rather than the

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,550
URL to have it like magically convert

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,450
itself underneath into the actual normal

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,350
syntax so they're all normalized for you

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,640
which is something that WordPress

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,920
actually can does if you paste in the

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,870
URL to youtube it pops up and in bed for

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,540
you so we want to make sure that we're

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,320
kind of feature parity with that because

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,149
I think that would be useful and then

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,920
there's the shortcode in bed the other

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,350
embed thing that we're planning which is

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,910
kind of like macros I don't know if you

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,370
only one to use shortcodes and Drupal

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,250
it's kind of just like little random

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,950
stuff like oh I want to you know do a

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,010
special call out text in my body that

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,370
maybe doesn't respond doesn't correspond

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,839
to a specific tag out of the box so I'm

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,810
just going to put a like a form that

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,149
says here's type in the call-out text

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,490
and select something else and it'll

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,170
transform it into an HTML tag like this

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,480
that's kind of one of the other use

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,110
cases there are not as much as the

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,589
entities and URLs but it's it's there so

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,839
we're kind of planning that right now

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:57,529
all right so we cover the embedding any

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,529
questions about embedding all right yes

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,299
yes the question is how those tags go

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,029
through yes they go through a text

00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,370
format system that converts that Drupal

00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:20,230
dash entity tag into whatever is

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,679
rendered like it'll be inside a div or

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,679
whatever

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,510
yeah it should be possible yeah that's

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,330
definitely what we're trying to abstract

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:46,360
is is different ways to embed stuff and

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,360
kind of use that same system yeah yes

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,790
yeah so so the the question of like

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:20,060
keeping kind of the files and assets

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,890
separate out of the body first as kind

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,320
of storage and not directly embedding

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,000
them the nice thing about having this

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,740
kind of standard tag is that it should

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,810
be totally possible sir like the insert

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,540
module to basically reuse the same

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,670
syntax and like have an insert button on

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,970
your file field that then just pops up

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,110
that that tag into your body field so as

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,840
long as you've like uploaded it

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,460
somewhere it can just be used and as

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,910
long as someone uses that tag it'll just

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:50,930
automatically work does it help a little

00:18:46,910 --> 00:19:04,430
bit all right if you have more just let

00:18:50,930 --> 00:19:08,120
me know cool yes so file locking in

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,920
Drupal 8 an update on that we've

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,490
actually got an issue into core that's

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,230
been committed that makes the so the

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,330
issue is that like if you upload a file

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,500
and then don't use it anymore Drupal

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,530
will automatically delete that file

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,360
after six hours we've got it made it's

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,010
now configurable out of the box

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,140
interpolate you can set it to be like

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,570
don't ever delete my files just keep

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:33,260
them around which eliminates the need to

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,810
lie clock every file we do still track

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,850
file usage in Drupal 8 and the nice

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,730
thing about having that standard syntax

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,620
of that tag for embedding entities is

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,350
that we automatically can track that

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,570
usage then so like I've embedded that

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,340
file on note 1

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:53,230
and it stores that automatically we've

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,230
worked with women leaders on that so

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,050
yeah once you save the note it'll it'll

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,040
record that in for the file usage table

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,960
yep hmm but it's kind of nice that like

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
out of the box you can set that you

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,770
don't need to lock all files which is

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:44,590
nice let that hacker in duple 7 I hate

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:46,810
that yeah yes yes in since it tracks the

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,030
usage is fine if you've embedded a file

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,310
and you delete that note it'll delete

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,280
the usage for that file and then if

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,060
Drupal sees that oh I had usage but now

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,560
I have none it will mark it as temporary

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,850
and it's up to your configuration

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,520
whether you've set the default of six

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:13,690
hours or change that it will remove it

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:17,340
or not so no you cannot set that in four

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,340
individual files it's it's a global

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,610
yeah I would definitely foresee a use

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,040
case for some kind of file locking on

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,500
individual files still like always

00:21:41,040 --> 00:22:16,110
always keep this file I yeah I would see

00:21:43,500 --> 00:22:17,430
that use case got it good point um the

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,380
great thing about your point is that

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,350
file usage system is totally swappable

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,450
so you could swap out a like per file or

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,180
whatever logic that your your

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,690
organization needed to do that so it's

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,070
it's very possible so yeah alright any

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,710
questions about embedding before I move

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,370
on to browsing all right we'll go ahead

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:41,490
move on so entity browser is the the new

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,530
home for the browsing component and this

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,470
is probably the biggest challenge I

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:49,350
think for for moving forward because

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,690
it's not a simple task to kind of

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,590
abstract browsing files into browsing

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,350
any entity but we're working on it it's

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,930
making progress I it's may be usable if

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,910
you're if you're living on the edge but

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,500
we're definitely working a lot more we

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,060
this is our third google summer of code

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,290
project to have someone helping out on

00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:13,910
this and so we have completed the basic

00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:16,950
architecture and api and like the

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:20,520
configuration like the config entities

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:23,490
for browsers and I'll kind of show the

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,870
the fun architecture picture and it's

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,990
also integrated with the inline entity

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,460
form right now so if you browse for

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,120
something you can also in line edit it

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,370
in the in the browser as well we still

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,140
need to work on the UI for browsing it's

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,820
still a lot in progress

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,440
um and we also want to make sure that

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,330
it's really fully integrated with views

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,310
you use vuze to select stuff that was

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,740
one of our big things that we really

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,810
liked when we did the media 2x branches

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,120
basing it on views and we want to make

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:55,510
sure that that's possible in Drupal 8 48

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,890
and neat and the any entity type but it

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,540
gets complex when you had you know

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,880
filters and all this extra stuff that

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,200
views wants to do so it's just a hard

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,980
problem we're trying to work through but

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,870
that's that's that's our goal so so the

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,550
fun architecture for entity browser is

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,340
there's like you know there's different

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,960
ways to display the the browser you know

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,760
could it be a standalone thing could it

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,150
be an iframe could it be a modal most

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,330
people probably with a modal or in line

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,520
kind of a thing there's you know the

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,650
widgets the individual widgets for the

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,200
browser you know is there an upload tab

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,480
is there a selection tab is there a

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,580
paste a URL tab that kind of stuff and

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,650
we really want to make sure that we're

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,190
you know we're using existing stuff so

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,620
it could be a view it could be a widget

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,860
for a Drupal whitefield type so like the

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,540
upload widget for files should be you

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,330
know something you can use natively in

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,340
this entity browser and that way it kind

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,500
of reduces the need for custom code and

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,470
if you can write a widget a field widget

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,380
you can use it here there's the way to

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,970
you know display the widgets you know

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,440
are they tabs are they drop downs are

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,050
they buttons could you change the way

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,340
that they're displayed and then how you

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,170
display the items that have been

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,000
selected do you put them in a grid do

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,830
you put them in a list that kind of

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,010
stuff so like there's a pretty complex

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,810
architecture here and I think we we run

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:20,290
a little bit of a risk of this being the

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:22,060
next big project still that becomes hard

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,280
to maintain so we're trying to make sure

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,720
that that doesn't happen and there's a

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,110
lot of good people working behind that

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,570
too and just kind of a tease a little

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:36,400
bit this is you can kind of see in the

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:39,130
background here this is the browsing

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,230
here it's then select entities and we

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,780
popped up the browser in a modal window

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,960
and using inline entity form to edit a

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,630
media entity so it is kind of it's

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,659
working somewhat so feel free to give

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,639
that a try

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:57,259
or if you want to help out have you

00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:59,960
appreciate it so that is the browsing

00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:04,849
component and now we can I hit into the

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,519
storage part so file once d I've been in

00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:09,859
one of the maintainer zuv this there was

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,950
an effort to porn it about 10 months ago

00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,419
that kind of hasn't had any update since

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,580
then so it's a little bit stalled

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:20,239
because I highly doubt that that code

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:24,229
works on Drupal 8 right now being as it

00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:27,919
was 10 months ago and that's like 500

00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:29,929
cat years in Drupal so we're going to

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,999
regroup a little bit on this one we kind

00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,669
of want to take a better plan because

00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:38,029
file MC had a lot of responsibilities in

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:41,479
Drupal 7 2 it made files filled a bowl

00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:43,239
it added the UI so adding editing and

00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:46,580
deleting files individually without

00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:49,899
having to work with nodes the listing

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,519
forms it added downloading for matters

00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:56,059
and lots of other stuff like it added

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:58,129
audio and video for matters basic HTML 5

00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,899
for matters so it kind of had a lot of

00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:01,820
responsibility I think we need any need

00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:04,580
to look at you know how should we split

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,599
this up should we just make a html5

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,849
formatters module you know and what is

00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,019
file in 2d become interpolate I think we

00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,179
just kind of have to stick a step back

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,429
with that one but it definitely will be

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,919
ported to Drupal 8 this one will be

00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,479
available I think that doesn't get out

00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,330
as often as much but there's definitely

00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:25,369
an intent to do that so if you'd like to

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,570
help i'm sure i'll be talking a bit

00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,830
about that this week with some of the

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,229
other maintained errs if you have ideas

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:36,109
come see me the the media module that

00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:37,669
became all that glue for everything is

00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:39,200
still going to be a glue module in

00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:40,700
Drupal 7 but it's not going to have all

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,749
those responsibilities it's just going

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,659
to be glue and glue is good as long as

00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:49,460
it's good glue so it'll be based on file

00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:52,549
it's the in Drupal 8 it'll have a

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:55,099
pre-configured entity browser for you to

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:57,919
use with files and have a pre-configured

00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:59,359
into the embed button for files so like

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,739
if you install media out of the box

00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,479
interpolate or hope is that like

00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:03,889
everything just kind of works for you

00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,640
you can customize it tweak it however

00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:08,400
you

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,810
and with the configuration management in

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,720
Drupal 8 I think that'll be a lot easier

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:16,320
to do as well so we're looking forward

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,600
to that the other big storage component

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,280
is the media entity so this is something

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,830
new well not really that new but the one

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,130
of the discussions from from the New

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,690
York City camp nice camp was that the

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,960
skald maintain errs have this kind of

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,370
abstract concept of you know not

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,990
everything should be a file it should be

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:40,670
this own separate thing they call an

00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:43,050
atom but we wanted to kind of maybe

00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,220
switch that into a different terminology

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,470
that could be then shared by other

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,000
people so that's kind of where the media

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:52,260
entity was born so this is pretty usable

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,330
right now there's some people I think

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:59,130
examiner is using it for a Drupal 8

00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:01,260
project and we've the basic forms and

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,430
editorial you eyes are completed and

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,410
there's already some provider

00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:08,820
integrations for YouTube Twitter

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:10,500
Instagram and local files and I think

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,760
rendering is one of the big issues

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:19,520
that's still kind of to do so yeah I

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,930
mean it's in progress / usable so and

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,850
then I have kind of some quick

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:27,540
screenshot just so the progress of this

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:30,240
so this is creating a YouTube media file

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,230
as you'd paste in the URL so that and

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,290
it's kind of a little bit more of an

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,150
abstract kind of form and this you know

00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,070
you'll kind of get to pick interplay

00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,990
between 500 entity and media entity and

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,700
we'll try and do a good job of

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,800
documenting the reasons why you want to

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,360
pick each one once we've got them fully

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,240
developed because that'll probably be

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,740
the big question for everyone but it's

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,300
it's kind of nice to have these two

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,220
different kind of options for storage

00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,990
because it makes us really think about

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,550
that embedding and the browsing

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,430
components and making sure that they

00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:04,050
work for both of these things because

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:07,050
there's a immediate pinkeye module now

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm not sure how it got that name it

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,929
kind of has a disease kind of

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,279
connotation but

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:18,649
I'm sure it's great it's kind of what's

00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,419
bringing together media entity the media

00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:23,029
brow the entity browser together it's

00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,889
kind of the glue module for the media

00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,360
entity so you kind of well if you want

00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,669
to try and see how that everything works

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:33,499
together with these components I would

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:37,129
give that a shot another fun module

00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,779
dimension is the the cropping API this

00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:40,820
is a a new module that we kind of

00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,440
started looking at all the cropping

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,779
different cropping modules they're all

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,119
storing basically the same stuff you

00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:49,639
know an XY coordinate or rectangle some

00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,440
kind of thing about an image and we

00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:56,480
wanted to give them kind of an API to

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,480
base off of and kind of standardized so

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,369
it's it's just an API but it's it's in

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,009
progress right now it's it I think it's

00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:07,519
pretty almost finished just aside from

00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:09,830
any integrations or UI but that's pretty

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,389
ready to go so if you're looking for for

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,389
cropping I would keep posted on this one

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,590
another small module that I think I find

00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:23,090
really interesting is the fall back for

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:26,210
matter so meet file entity in Drupal 7

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:30,019
had this fun concept of you know ok I

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,029
have a video file and I want to figure

00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:35,629
out how to display it ok I'm gonna try

00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:37,369
my YouTube file format of first and that

00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:41,179
formatter says hey are you a YouTube

00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,249
file no okay move along and then it goes

00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:46,309
to the next thing like okay is it a

00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:48,679
local video file and it says yes I am

00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:52,820
and it says okay I'll here's the HTML

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:55,399
and formatter to use use html5 video and

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,929
it kinda has that system of falling back

00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:01,100
to the next one next one next one until

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:03,350
it falls back to a default and so we

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,629
abstracted this to its own module in

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:09,679
Drupal 7 and it sported a Drupal 8 as

00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:11,269
well it's not passing the test though

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,529
for some reason I tried to fix that this

00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:15,740
morning but I couldn't I didn't have

00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:17,360
time but it's an interesting interesting

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,740
concept to use like if you have a file

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,740
field yes

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,090
totally yes it works for multiple values

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,530
it's the design for like the multiple

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,450
value use case like if you've got a

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,730
YouTube video and slot one of your field

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,250
and an image and slot two of your field

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,720
and a local video in slot three of your

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,460
field like this would gives you a way to

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,580
display all of those items in their own

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,770
way if you had a file field so it's it's

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,360
you can kind of see like you pick which

00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,950
formatters you want to do you drag them

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,810
in the right order that you want them to

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,470
run in and then you give those four

00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:58,960
matters the options that you want so it

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:02,950
just it works it works great so that's a

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,990
it's a fun one to use if you need it and

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:08,080
another interesting one is the recycled

00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:12,190
for matters i like this name so there's

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:15,220
an interesting problem that say you put

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,670
a file field on your node and you upload

00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:21,190
images to it um you can't actually just

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,600
like pick them to be displayed as images

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,750
you have to have them like rendered as

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,790
generic files or a link because if you

00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,320
use a file field you cannot use image

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,560
field for matters they're two separate

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,900
field types or if you had an entity

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,880
reference field that had files you're

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,620
limited to entity reference field for

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,930
matters you can't use a file format or

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,700
or an image for matter and I don't think

00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,960
that's cool you should be able to reuse

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,030
those between those they're all

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,120
references essentially their files or

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,160
entities so this is this we have a

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,810
module in Drupal 7 called file image for

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,900
matters that lets you reuse between file

00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,910
and image fields though we wanted to

00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,850
take that to the next level in Drupal 8

00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,560
and possibly backport that Bashar

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,710
between image file and into reference

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,910
fields so it's like a little bit of

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,790
insurance like if you pick the wrong

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:16,570
field type you're not screwed down the

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:19,929
road so yeah I mentioned downloading in

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,159
file entities responsibilities we want

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,050
to put this off into a separate module

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,090
just called like file download there's

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,710
been several modules out there like

00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,139
related to file download and file

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,110
download tracking it'd be nice to have

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,280
one good home for that now in Drupal 8

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:38,030
so like having a URL to hit for it

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,280
download like file / 5 / download with

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,919
secure tokens that people aren't

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,730
crawling every file download link by a

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:49,130
numeric index you know provide support

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,940
for access control can this user

00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:55,010
download this file or not and logging

00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,280
downloads to like all right this file

00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,480
has been downloaded 40 times by this IP

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,570
kind of thing which i think is useful

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:07,280
for a lot of implementing sites so we're

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,960
planning this out right now and then we

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,870
have struggles so that's our progress

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,320
and I and I want to touch on the human

00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:17,540
side of this too I mean we struggle as a

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,110
group I struggle as an individual with

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,000
this too I think recent I mean I was on

00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:26,570
paternity leave for four weeks I was

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,640
completely out and so like I couldn't

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,410
really follow stuff and taking care of

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,650
two kids I can't really do stuff on the

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,650
side was learning how to how to handle

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,330
that and I you know just got back to

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,890
work a week before drupalcon so it's

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,770
kind of like this flurry of trying to

00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:45,410
get everything prepared and get updated

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:48,230
on everything and I think I let you know

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,690
some things fall and it's like when we

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,120
don't have a definitive person to lead

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,050
stuff like the official drupal.org

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,420
initiatives you know someone who's you

00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,580
know that good communicator and you know

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:04,450
project me project manager kind of

00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:08,270
person that can help motivate people and

00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:09,680
ensure things are constantly going we

00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,340
struggle with that since we don't really

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,660
have that so we're trying to keep that

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,430
going but it's it kind of it goes well

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,670
and then it may be goes not so well for

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:25,220
a couple months so yeah we're just we're

00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,510
trying to keep improving that we're

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,550
still working on you know stuff like

00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,790
funding you'd be nice to have sprints

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,260
every quarter with our team like not

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,300
necessarily a Drupal events like it'd

00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,790
just be nice to hang out for a week you

00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,580
know at an Airbnb and just you know code

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,110
all of us together in the same room you

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,600
know where we're not distracted with a

00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,799
Drupal event so we're trying to figure

00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,720
that out

00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:54,160
another thing that's been interesting to

00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:57,819
look at is composer usage in Drupal 8 so

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,430
stuff like plupload you know including

00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:02,950
external libraries how do we do that

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,930
from a from a reliable perspective you

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,760
know if you install modules how do those

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,109
libraries get downloaded because the

00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,230
user shouldn't have to know all those

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:12,849
libraries for them and I would wanted to

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,910
call specifically there's a buff today

00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:18,460
at five between five and six pm to kind

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:22,270
of discuss our options and figure out a

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,500
path forward so I will be there and I

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:27,309
would encourage anyone interested in

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,750
that issue to be there as well so we're

00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:32,280
just we're not sure how to use composer

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,280
quite yet from a module standpoint

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,630
something I kind of deal with is is

00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,910
github versus drupal.org we moved a lot

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,670
of our development to github for these

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,799
modules with ink which i think is great

00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,740
github has definitely good use case and

00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:49,180
I love pull requests it's all good an

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,589
inline commenting and Paul request is

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,119
good but I'm starting to really get

00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:54,849
frustrated with the separation between

00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,440
like our issues in drupal.org and the

00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:58,210
pull request in github and like

00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,440
communication happening in two different

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:05,530
sides and there's a proposal to make

00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,650
issue workspaces on drupal.org to kind

00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,390
of help give you git repos per issue so

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,329
you could make you know check out a

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,920
branch that corresponds to an issue and

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:16,420
so there's a session on Wednesday I want

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,240
justice we call out for that because i

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,589
was super interested in that too but I

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,780
just find that challenging like

00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,970
duplicating efforts like it's nice to

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,280
have one home on github as an

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,200
organization like here's all the modules

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,690
we're working on you know rather than

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,809
drupal.org trying to search for all that

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:38,049
stuff so that's just kind of one thing I

00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:40,839
wanted to point out and of course how do

00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:45,640
you get involved there's lots of ways to

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:47,349
get involved we attempt to have weekly

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,780
scrum meetings in IRC but I think the

00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:51,960
last two months have been not very

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,099
regular on that that's that's our bad

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,230
we're going to try and revamp that again

00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:58,970
but if you come to IRC just feel free to

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,370
ask a question meditate I'm you know

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:05,180
I ceased I had log stuff all the time so

00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:06,830
I respond back when I can someone posted

00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,180
a question at two a.m. this morning and

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:12,290
I finally got back at 7am today so we

00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,080
like I said we have our github

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,150
organization Drupal dash media that

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,180
poses houses all the development

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,760
projects there we like to use a service

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:26,060
called hack pad for planning discussions

00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,660
and architecture documents to and we

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:33,380
have a group group on group stupid org

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,320
as well that we post stuff to as well my

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,860
cell phone Yanez are here we both you

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,540
can contact us on drupal.org we're

00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,550
trying to get more Sprint's organized I

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,590
have a slide on the next one we use

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,440
Trello for like organizing our sprints

00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,930
and stuff just Trello calm / Drupal

00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,640
media and we also have a website drupal

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,690
media org but it's kind of this

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,480
should've been when one of our struggles

00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,760
I'm not sure how to use it properly yet

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,070
we haven't figured out how to like what

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,700
content do we post there that kind of

00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,380
stuff and how we keep it updated I

00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,040
wanted to point out that we are

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,240
sprinting all this week in Los Angeles

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,160
so feel free to join us in the coders

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,860
lounge if you're there or just pop into

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,500
IRC and in the pound Drupal dash media

00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,840
channel will direct you to someone who

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,780
can help and there's also going to be a

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,640
dedicated week-long media sprint at nice

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,890
camp the New York City camp July

thirteenth the 19th so if you're

00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,720
interested in that feel free to check

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:38,450
that out or if you want to have a sprint

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:43,180
on media let us know all right any other

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,180
questions at all yes

00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:53,349
um it's it's kind of hard for me to

00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:56,229
explain a little bit just because it is

00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:59,380
an API so it's just mostly like how does

00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:00,849
I think it stores an entity type for

00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:08,229
yeah he's going to give a better answer

00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:10,869
I'll let them answer yeah it's it's

00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:15,249
basically a storage component for for

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:18,549
crops it is a custom entity type that

00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:21,479
stores the coordinates of the crop area

00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:24,939
on an image and it's kind of done

00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:29,079
generically so it can work with file

00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:32,559
entity and media entity and you could

00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,409
you could do like straight strange

00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,569
things if you have an immature node and

00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,939
you could implement it in a way that you

00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:42,819
would store crop information directly

00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:44,589
for that node even going around for

00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:48,399
entity so it's kind of generic its

00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:52,119
storage part it is implemented in a way

00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:55,269
that allows you to store either just

00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,689
focal part information or the entire

00:41:55,269 --> 00:42:01,269
crop region and it's that way we wanted

00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:03,789
to provide support for both cases

00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:07,329
because right now 57 you have modules to

00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:10,179
do either of those and that's more or

00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:12,189
less it it's just storage that stores in

00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:15,009
an entity and because it's an entity you

00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:18,189
could add fields to it if you need to

00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:21,609
store on some more information with it

00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:22,959
or could be revisional yeah yeah like

00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:25,089
your focal point could be revisional

00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:27,399
that's kind of interesting you couldn't

00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:29,469
reference to it from some other entities

00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:35,339
use the entity reference things like

00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:35,339
that there was a question over here yeah

00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,720
sure so the first part of kind of what

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,869
the screenshots are based on this is me

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,460
entity here and the screenshot of the

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:34,730
Media Browser is also media entity

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,980
powered as well the embedding stuff is

00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,740
just any entity works out of the box it

00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,619
doesn't really rely on files files are

00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:51,430
in core it's just like you can only

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:56,589
reference them by a file name so yep

00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,589
does that help answer that part okay

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:17,070
it would be the same thing so like let's

00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,560
see so like this example where I'm

00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:22,500
referencing the file that has the file

00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,750
name Matt dash cheese gift that is a

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,320
file ends d just in core they're not

00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,910
feel double and there's a listing page

00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,370
of files but you can't really do much

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,920
with it it just linked the file and

00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,840
shows you where it's in use you can't

00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,710
like delete the files from that page or

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,510
edit them that kind of stuff but you

00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,800
know this since they're already defined

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:48,660
as an entity type it works out of the

00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:51,030
box with the embedding stuff yeah well

00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,740
they were in it to type in Drupal 7 it's

00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,260
kind of the same situation enjoy it now

00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,870
so yeah but we didn't have anything that

00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,880
worked on an abstract basis like this in

00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:04,410
Drupal 7 before but it's nice to have

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:08,930
this now and the second part okay all

00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,930
right cool yes

00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:20,100
totally yeah totally put in a user you

00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:28,980
can put in a block you can anything

00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:32,609
that's an entity type it can get hairy

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,170
but it works which is nice like the fact

00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:36,570
that it works is kind of the big thing

00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,220
for us yeah yeah that's your

00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,740
responsibility if you do crazy things

00:45:38,220 --> 00:46:05,100
with your tools yeah you're on your own

00:45:40,740 --> 00:46:07,830
there yeah yeah it gets you know they're

00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,630
rolled a file or document is in a very

00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,030
sort of like document management system

00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,550
sort of idea and this idea of game with

00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:17,040
revision files or vision data data do

00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:19,320
you see this as being like basically a

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,030
way that we can provide digital asset

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,820
management or something like the

00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:29,650
or providing some type of other

00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,650
provisional file entity type through

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,380
contribu seen any of that as working

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:38,450
so I think yeah it should be totally

00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,100
possible you know with both solutions

00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,930
media entity and violent ed I think we

00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,710
should be shooting for revisional out of

00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:47,600
the box for both I know media entity is

00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,550
and I know that there's a computer

00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,460
project for file onto these in Drupal 7

00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,840
like violent few revisions and that's

00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,880
kind of one of the things that like I

00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,400
was taking a look at file onto the again

00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:01,400
it's like maybe adding revision support

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,320
like as a sub-module like to have it

00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,390
there and not a separate a separate

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,180
project like bringing it into file into

00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,690
the abit might be a good idea like hey I

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,530
really would like revisions for my files

00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,530
would be nice to have

00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:06,440
yeah or based on the crop API yeah

00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:10,310
definitely all right if anyone's

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:14,320
interested see him and all right any

00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,320
questions at all yes in the back

00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:28,390
you

00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,390
mm-hmm yep

00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,089
yeah so why don't we ditch the file and

00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,510
image field type cinder bite and just

00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:44,720
use empty reference at before there

00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:47,150
wasn't like the ability to say like oh

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,040
if I'm referencing a file only these

00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,780
four matters are available that was only

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,480
added kind of very late in the diploid

00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,800
cycle and I think like at this point

00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,780
we're trying to get to release out the

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,400
door I think that should be the goal at

00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,349
this point is to have just an entity

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,069
reference that says I can reference

00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:07,040
files because Drupal core does now have

00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:10,250
the way that says hey am I I Miami I'm a

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,750
formatter is in my attached to an entity

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,540
reference field that references files

00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,760
okay I can be used if not no don't show

00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,680
me in the list so that way like you

00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,630
could see image and responsive image in

00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,640
the list of four matters for that but

00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:25,250
not in like the node reference fields

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,339
yeah I know there's an issue for that

00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:33,160
out there but that's probably 8.1

00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:33,160
material so yeah all right

00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:50,760
so does the HD browser allow me to

00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:53,390
browse a both files and so that's an

00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,390
advantage that

00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:08,820
yeah we're not exactly so bringing up

00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,320
the point that like if the embedding

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,599
concept right now is very specific to

00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,250
one entity types like it's very discreet

00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,010
I went to insert a file I want to insert

00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:19,380
a node we haven't quite figured out how

00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:23,760
we're going to handle cross like

00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:25,349
multiple entity type support it should

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,760
be in our roadmap it's just kind of the

00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:28,400
problem that we're like let's get this

00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,780
working and working really well first

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,760
kind of but that should be in a roadmap

00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,760
so if not what's file an issue for that

00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,940
yeah

00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,750
in Europe yeah and you're also going to

00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,100
run to the issue that views can't list

00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,740
multiple entity types in the same

00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:18,140
display like that's that's a blocker for

00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:18,140
that to two different widgets yes yeah

00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,800
yeah yeah I mean for now you can just

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,260
have separate buttons I think that that

00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:52,950
works for a majority use case yeah

00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:54,750
totally yeah in an editor side to I

00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:58,350
think it's more discreet like I'm going

00:51:54,750 --> 00:52:00,630
to insert this thing yeah yeah yeah all

00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:04,550
right if you have any questions tweet me

00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:04,550
find me a little about booth after ya

00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:16,470
pink eye is based on Animal Farm not the

00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:19,170
disease okay got it that's we might well

00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:22,310
put them on the project page alright

00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,310
