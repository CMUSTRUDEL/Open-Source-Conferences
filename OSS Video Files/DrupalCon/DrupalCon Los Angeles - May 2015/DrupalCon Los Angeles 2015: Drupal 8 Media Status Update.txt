Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal 8 Media Status Update
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 Contrib Media Team is making good progress on our master plan for media handling in Drupal 8. We'd like to share what we've done so far, what is left to do, and how everything fits together into the vision we have for D8 Media. 

Specific things we'd like to have a conversation about with the D8 core and contrib developers:

How can we solve contrib library dependencies? We're using Composer for Drupal Core but we also include all of our external libraries in Core itself. Should contrib do the same?
What, if anything should we propose to improve the media handling support for Drupal 8 core before release? What could we include in the 8.x.x minor releases? What needs to wait for Drupal 9?
What needs have we not considered or need to meet?
