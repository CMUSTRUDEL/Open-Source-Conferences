done I maintain CRM core I maintain a

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,690
couple of other modules I really believe

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,389
that people run technology companies

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,360
should know something about technology

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:17,850
which is what makes me cool and then I'm

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,150
also the father of two kids and I have a

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,330
dog like do you want it-- reduce

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,279

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:44,910
wonderful kitten and lacy millennial as

i read thanks Blake I'm Jake two min I'm

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,469
a project manager here at trollin I'm

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,260
from San Diego originally you can find

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,969
me at JW two men on Twitter IRC and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,140
drupal org and I'm excited to say this

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,340
is my third drupalcon together the three

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,910
of us today are going to talk a little

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,989
bit about agile development techniques

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,689
we're going to talk about this from the

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,610
perspective of being a company that is

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,260
trying to implement agile processes I

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,200
would love to just see a show of hands

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,119
here you know who works for a web

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,369
development firm maybe you know not an

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,750
agency but so I'm group looking to

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,040
implement agile can I see a show of

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,320
hands ok I think that's that's about

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,509
forty percent of the room by a quick

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,310
count I think you're going to find that

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,049
we have some very practical techniques

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,000
and some very practical approaches to

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,079
talk about here today the very first

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,390
thing we're going to talk about really

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,390
is implementing agile ok what goes into

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,590
that why people think about it but we're

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,049
going to look at it in terms of some of

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,030
the challenges that exist secondly we're

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,399
going to talk about where to start I

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,950
think every long road starts with the

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,110
first step and we're going to make some

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,880
suggestions about you know kind of kind

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,270
of where to consider putting that first

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,969
foot third we're going to talk about how

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,740
agile fits into our sales process we

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,570
have vertically integrated into

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,880
everything that we do and so will show

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,069
off some of the techniques that we use

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,250
in order to get agile going even before

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,540
in a project starts next we'll talk a

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,680
little bit about from the design

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,159
perspective

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,500
really where I'll jump in and just try

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,939
to illustrate how agile happens okay

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,760
because for a lot of folks they have

00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,890
trouble visualizing like where to start

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,810
having conversations about user stories

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,310
and things and so will lay some of that

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,889
out and hopefully you know lend some

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,969
clarity and then finally we're going to

00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:35,609
talk about it from the development phase

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,709
okay when does agile come in to what

00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:40,680
we're doing how do we do sprints and how

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,420
do we stick with our scrubs but first

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,920
roll it all back let's talk a little bit

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,900
about implementing agile okay

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,530
implementing agile within an

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,269
organization I Trella is our company

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,919
it's you know ten years old we've been

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,870
involved in the community since you know

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,669
God knows one and over the last 10 years

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,489
we've had a lot of time to try and

00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,689
perfect or project management processes

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,069
it's really been over the last three

00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,409
years that we've been making a strong

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,419
push to move towards agile we have an

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,419
existing development process that's been

00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,859
in place forever it is effective you

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,109
know when answering some of the common

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,549
challenges that we have but at the same

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,040
time getting to the point where

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,889
stakeholders outside our organization

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,870
developers designers are all on the same

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,239
page has really been like the holy grail

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,069
for us having an efficient and

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,260
convenient way to move between different

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,609
phases of projects where people are

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,019
really bought in and excited about what

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,810
they're doing you know I think is what

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,569
every development process should be be

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,699
structured like so we had to look at

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,259
agile we had to really think to

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,909
ourselves you know what are the things

00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,220
that that we're looking to accomplish

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:50,790
here we find that it helps to start with

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,370
some definitions but there's a lot of

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,560
words to learn some of the I guess

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,290
common terms that come up very often or

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,030
listed here what we found is that as you

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,669
went from a project manager to a

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,549
director to a you know technical lead to

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:07,530
a lead developer to a designer all of

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,030
these terms had very different meanings

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,680
even after we had sent people to

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,379
trainings they would come in and talk

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,229
about what a sprint is what a backlog is

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,519
you know what burn rate really means and

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,070
it wouldn't be a universal definition

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,989
that everybody adhered to so an

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,450
organizational challenge that we really

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,430
faced was you know trying to get

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,900
everybody on the same page about what

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,370
this is

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,070
another option that a lot of folks have

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:36,430
is to go out and get some training which

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,870
takes time to implement most shops look

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,210
that are looking to implement agile

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,980
aren't necessarily looking to just jump

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,990
in with both feet they're not

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,450
necessarily looking to send people off

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,890
to extensive training courses what

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,650
they're looking for is very practical

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,330
ways of getting started that haven't

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,220
demonstrable impact that can be measured

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,220
you know in the near term in six months

00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,670
to a year not necessarily one that that

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,960
takes a large investment in order to

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:07,390
switch over to so um we had sent a few

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,710
people to get certifications with scrum

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,780
alliance it worked out okay those people

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,700
quickly found jobs at other companies

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,910
because now they were certified product

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,180
owners and you know there's there's

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,310
other sides that go along to it so how

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,990
do you find a balance for Trella and

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,510
what we really tried to do is focus on

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,820
integrating agile development techniques

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,550
not just in the development process but

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,430
with inter sales process within our

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,190
design process and and then also in you

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,160
know our coding and that was hard okay I

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,350
wouldn't say it's like NP level hard but

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,300
when you have a lot of different people

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,460
with a lot of different ideas about what

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,710
things mean there tends to be a lot of

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,450
confusion instead of working on a

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,390
project there's a lot of discussion

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,820
about some abstract concept about how to

00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,620
work on a project all of a sudden and it

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,630
takes time for the dust to settle and

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,410
that's normal that's that's what should

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,020
happen at the end of this road it led to

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,990
a lot of improvements and outcomes okay

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,630
we were able to finally start making

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,610
promises that you know if it's going to

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,020
take us six months to get a project done

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,850
we would really deliver within six

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,530
months things wouldn't get stretched out

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,820
if we're saying that it's going to cost

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,680
a hundred thousand dollars to do

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,560
something we're not suddenly charging

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,390
you 120 thousand dollars okay and then

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,830
finally that the quality of the project

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,840
you know what we actually build reflects

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,300
what you intended it at the start

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,860
there's not some feature missing that's

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,800
suddenly getting pushed to a phantom

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,210
phase two that doesn't exist yet these

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
were the kinds of outcomes that we were

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,190
seeing

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,260
across the board as we started getting

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,310
deeper and deeper and using some of the

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,830
techniques we're going to talk about

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,400
here in a few minutes but there's one

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,780
big outcome that really does matter and

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,880
with all of the other ones we can still

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:59,290
get away with it if we if we slip in one

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,050
of those areas but happiness is kind of

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,670
the key outcome that that I like to see

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,560
people should really love what's doing

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,960
what's being built if you're doing agile

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,210
right what happens is you see people's

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,700
hopes their aspirations their ideas for

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,250
their applications being expressed in a

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,870
much more meaningful way that they can

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,720
understand when you get to the end of a

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,730
project um these are some letters that I

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,910
got recently i'm not doing this as like

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,380
an advertisement but um i think our

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,580
clients actually say it the best and

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,560
much better than i ever could you know

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,840
having a perfect delivery on this is

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,580
very real for us and I'm glided Trella

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,200
again came through with goods you guys

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,350
are in danger of making it look easy but

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,180
I know it's not we get to the level of

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,620
predictability where we can say look you

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,290
know we're going to do this at a certain

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,640
level of you know it's it's going to

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,860
cost so much and it's going to be done

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,140
at a certain time and and that's the

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,200
kind of reaction you get from folks when

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,580
when they actually see it happening you

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,900
got an exceptional amount done in a very

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,700
tight time window I've said it before

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,070
but your project managers are great

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,050
communicators one of the other sort of

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,910
tangible effects that we've seen is

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,880
since we've really switched over to

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,880
agile everybody thinks we are the

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,520
greatest communicators on earth I don't

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,380
put us too far above or too far below

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,110
anybody i think you know we're not

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,420
mediocre but it does create an

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,430
impression relative to other people

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,790
folks have worked with that that you're

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:28,780
really on the ball at all times so a

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,460
useful perspective on where to start for

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,950
me it's always the way i like to think

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,990
about agile and the way i tell my team

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,570
to think about agile is really that we

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,479
are telling a story about a system and

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,219
we're carrying it out sorry and we're

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,520
carrying out the plans for how to build

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,470
it so when we can get away from the idea

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,390
that there is like a technique to this

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,360
and we can really just boil it down to

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,190
the simplest form this is what you can't

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,870
do without and still say you have an

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,030
agile process is that you're telling a

00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,350
story and you're putting the plans in

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,810
place for how you're going to build it

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,030
what we really started with you know our

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,770
pract our first practical steps that we

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,740
implemented into all of the stages of

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,170
our company processes is really the idea

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,210
of user stories okay they give us a

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,040
basis to understand what needs to be

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,410
done they get if it's a basis to

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,510
understand how much work goes in to

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,430
making it happen and they also give us a

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,470
basis for testing the outcomes when

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,940
we're done with development how do we

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,339
judge what it is that we've actually

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,300
done and that's what user stories give

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,600
us so for anybody who's unfamiliar you

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,130
know I'm sure the crowd this large you

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,900
know most folks probably have a have a

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,700
good sense of it but with each story

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,470
where there there is a construction to

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,870
it and we stick with a very formal

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,940
construction every story has a

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,910
perspective will say as an automated

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,800
user sorry as an authenticated user you

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,290
know as an administrator as someone else

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,330
but we're always saying where the story

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,390
comes from who this is attached to who

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,790
were worried about when we when we put

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,160
this down each story also has a

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,230
requirement that story has to say that

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,380
there's something this person can do

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,080
when they're in the system okay I should

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,839
be able to change my password each story

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,190
also has a justification that

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,110
justification is what communicates the

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,150
business value of it and the route you

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,680
know you could have a story that

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,620
explains how to do something without

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,420
that but when it makes sure of is that

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,610
your business stakeholders and your

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,740
developers always understand things and

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,910
see things eye to eye it lends greater

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,380
context everything that comes subsequent

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,700
once we got through user stories once we

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,800
got to the point where people could

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,740
grasp user stories where a designer and

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,180
a developer could write it and our

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,560
clients could tolerate us when we were

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,540
trying to put them together because

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,030
there are a lot of awkward steps in that

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:54,339
direction we moved on to points we use

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,589
points to measure everything okay to

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,140
measure work advert to measure business

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,240
priority those are the common ones we

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,950
use in the planning stage but then also

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,540
to measure the response from focus

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,430
groups we might be done with

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,650
design we might be testing a design to

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,540
understand how effective it is we will

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,060
actually use points built around user

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,470
stories to do that and then also to

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,450
assess outcomes at the end of a project

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,700
we might want to understand how well our

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,430
work matches up with the business value

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,470
that was expected at the initiation of a

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,470
project and so will will use points

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,350
there points are weird things you know

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,170
you want to apply them in a way that is

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,710
contextually relevant to a project but

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,630
you don't want people's kind of

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,220
preconceptions to creep in we use

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,950
something called a Fibonacci scale you

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,410
see it depicted here and it's just a

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,020
relative scale okay you know how much

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,790
work effort is required how valuable is

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,680
this compared to other requirements in

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,360
your system depending on the question

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,820
being asked it can be a really useful

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,280
tool what we really like about it is

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,800
that the answers that people give or

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,080
relative within that project maybe your

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,300
password reset feature as a business

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,940
value of one in one side because there's

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,380
a lot of users you need to reset their

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,000
that will rather there aren't many

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,160
people who need to reset their passwords

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,720
and maybe it's an 89 in another one

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
maybe it's a giant community and they

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,550
don't want administrators to ever have

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,380
to go back and change my password the

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,100
Fibonacci scale actually allows us to

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,590
kind of kind of stay in on that one

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,200
thing about points and this is something

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,760
we kind of trade as a truth is any time

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,770
we're going to collect points we don't

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,420
do it from just one person we're not

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,910
interested in one person's perspective

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,220
we try to shoot for a minimum of three

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,430
we try to shoot for no more than seven

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,230
and there's a little bit of research on

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,820
the you know upper side of that scale

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,800
that says you know you tend to get less

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,380
relevant results when you have larger

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,970
groups but on the lower side of the

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,550
scale what it is is we just don't want

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,040
one person's perspective to predominate

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,810
a conversation and that's why we're

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,700
always pulling together teams in order

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,850
to help evaluate you know whatever it is

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,920
that we're measuring after we got

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,820
through user stories after we started

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,470
creating points for everything looking

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,480
for those nexus between you know

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,730
development effort and business value

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,740
we got very serious about sprints and

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,110
structuring the work output of our team

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,449
to make sure that any time a developer

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,699
is working on code it's part of a plan

00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:30,279
where we've sized it and we can make

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:33,550
sure that things are going to get done

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,769
in a structured way every time we have a

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,810
sprint what we do is we prioritize the

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,540
Sprint's themselves around the things

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,120
with the greatest business value this

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,040
keeps us from you know risking letting

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,199
like you know critical path items fall

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,910
off of our development schedule right

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,339
you know we can always make sure we're

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,990
hitting the high notes first what's

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:55,110
Prince also allow us to do is to keep

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,240
development from getting out of control

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,160
any time we create a task that is part

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,649
of a sprint what we do is make sure it

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,930
won't take more than a week if it has

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,899
the potential to we break it into more

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,149
than one task and the reason is is just

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,180
we want to have predictable measurable

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:15,670
results at all times that's been kind of

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,610
a game changer for us the way sprints

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,910
and user stories intersect and and this

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,709
is what a lot of people you know I think

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,899
sort of miss when they think about how

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,389
all this goes together is that each user

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,190
story goes into a sprint if you collect

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,790
a hundred user stories maybe you break

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,649
it up ten by ten and suddenly it's ten

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,850
sprints but more likely what's going to

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,560
happen if you run organized

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,029
automatically into something called a

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,529
saga and a saga is well this is the way

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,380
we describe it to clients sometimes is

00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:51,220
it's the story of a user's journey

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,680
through your site it simply talks about

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,750
one kind of set of actions you want

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,610
people to take to do or one set of

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,240
things you want them to take away when

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,690
when they've come and experienced what

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,010
you have to offer part of what we do

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,110
with sprint says we're constantly

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,630
verifying and assessing what we've done

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,730
so we can involve stakeholders and the

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,490
sprint so you know every single day when

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,160
we're reviewing our work and doing

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,720
check-ins but most often what happens is

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,610
we have a shared desktop and at the end

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,990
of the week where you know logging in

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,939
demonstrating the way you would click

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,100
through things providing a little bit of

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,949
training you know on how it would work

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,230
and it's incredibly useful for us to do

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,080
that

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,690
because we're just collecting unbiased

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,940
kind of impressions does this work well

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,400
enough for me is this the thing that you

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,640
know I would like to be using incredibly

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,200
useful tool for all this is joined on me

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,570
we'll just get a shared desktop going

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,540
we'll get as many people into it as you

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,980
know feel like they need to be there and

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,260
we'll start showing off what's going on

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,560
at that point we have this opportunity

00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,580
right where we can stop being those

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,560
experts on the phone with you and we can

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,020
start being those people who are just

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,060
other users just like you and we can

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,550
talk frankly about what's going on it

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,800
tends to lead to better outcomes when we

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,090
can get stuff down to that level one of

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,710
the other things about sprints and I

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,940
just want to short quickly make that

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,670
point is that they're always time

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,230
limited we never go over two weeks on

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,520
any sprint like I said it has the

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,130
potential for things to get out of

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,640
control but really there's other reasons

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,010
for that too if you've got like 50

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,930
stories lined up okay and you fail on

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,520
you know three or four of them that's

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,180
better than failing on one out of ten

00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,310
isn't it like from a points perspective

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,590
anytime you can quantify developmental

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,510
measures and say to ourselves you know

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,090
we've got pass fail on this number of

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,740
things it's just a more structured way

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,200
of communicating and that's one of the

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,560
big reasons that we use time limits on

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,000
on all of our splints so some of the

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,560
side effects and this is just kind of to

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,330
summarize what you know three of the

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,640
very practical techniques are that we

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,830
think people ought to be considering in

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,010
order to get started really a

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,840
transparency the idea that your client

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,630
knows as much as you do about your

00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,420
application at all times and also about

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,430
the plans for what's going to you know

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,140
happen next you want business

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,200
stakeholders and developers really to

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,580
have that same level of understanding

00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,250
one of the things I've always hated is

00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,620
the idea that you know because I have a

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,600
technical perspective on something my

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,520
clients don't have a clue what it is

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,640
that I'm talking about and they're kind

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,960
of trying to tune me out agile

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,770
development techniques help us to get

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,600
past that real quick predictability we

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,290
really like knowing how much things are

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,830
going to cost and win

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,290
going to get done so to most folks when

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,440
we can get to that point where you know

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:55,110
we're making claims and we're delivering

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,880
on them that gives this whole other kind

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,770
of perspective into the things that is

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,510
that we do and it really plays into

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,550
those feelings of satisfaction that I

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,320
was talking about and it finally in

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,820
sight you know what one of the big

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,860
challenges that I've had with trial

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,110
under of ears is the idea that you know

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,580
like hey why did this thing break you

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,990
know I asked five different people all

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,370
of them worked on it none of them know

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,530
why it's broken it's really hard in the

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,000
midst of the development process to like

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,130
get to some of those answers sometimes

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,290
I'm not saying that I have the answer to

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,760
everything but probably four out of five

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,070
times what I go to ask a question about

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,840
what's going on I can track it back to a

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,300
user story I can track it back to a

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,920
sprint we can find a way to deal even

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,590
with really complex regression errors

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,690
simply by looking back at our process

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,130
and looking at the way these stories

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,440
unfolded it's a whole different

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,510
perspective to develop in I'm going to

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,510
back off and my good friend Blake here

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:51,810
is going to talk about the sales process

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,600
thanks Mike I'm going to talk a bit

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:58,490
about the sales process and using agile

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:04,500
techniques even at that early stage of

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:07,770
development so using sizing to scope of

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,100
projects you want to know that you're

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,290
not losing money on a deal and you know

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,520
since we've been since we've been

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:19,350
implementing this process I'd say you

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,960
know nine out of ten of the projects

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,510
that I've brought on have operated a

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,750
profit it creates transparency about the

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:31,170
work that will be done you understand

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,080
the time and effort needed and so you're

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,910
really empowering your developers you're

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,510
empowering your clients you're

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:43,140
empowering yourself as a salesperson and

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:46,080
you're keeping everyone happy as much as

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,120
humanly possible everyone is involved

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,350
and that's what's really cool about this

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,260
process

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:57,760
you don't have to be a genius to use it

00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:00,490
on you know I switched industries into

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,210
technology and it was very intimidating

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,320
at first because a client asked for

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,750
something and you want to make them

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,320
happy but then your developers are very

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:14,370
upset with you or me for promising these

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,549
things at a certain price level and so

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:21,940
this gets everyone involved and there's

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:24,400
um there's really two sides to it

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,820
there's the sales side the account

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:32,140
executive me and then there's the

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:35,830
developers and whereas what what Mike

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,780
and what Jake will talk about it has a

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,799
few more people involved with with the

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,870
process with with me it starts with

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,850
collecting requirements from a very high

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,539
level so meeting with clients

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,010
discovering what they need and and

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:53,020
collecting questions from the developers

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,200
so I bring I bring the list to the

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,700
developers and they'll ask me more

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,130
in-depth questions like how are we

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,380
actually going to get this done and from

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,539
there I'll itemize the things that need

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,720
to be done and put them in a list in a

00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,120
spreadsheet and we'll all hop on so

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,419
we're dealing with some third-party

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:17,049
integration with a non-profit recently

00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:19,480
and you know I really didn't know much

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:23,440
about this this type of integration and

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,240
so we went around we collect comparative

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,860
design compositions to understand the

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,960
user interface requirements and in that

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,690
process the developers evaluate each

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,130
requirement they point out gaps and

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,030
things that I might not have thought

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,770
about and they provide relative levels

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:46,270
of effort required to complete the work

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:49,600
so really it's just a process of

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:52,870
empowerment on any any employee at trail

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,780
on has a support system or or a safety

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,360
net almost so you're not going to over

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,390
promise something and with that you know

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,650
what needs to be done and you know that

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:07,000
you're not operating at a loss

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:13,260
yeah i'm going to hand it over to Mike

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,670
to discuss the design process thanks so

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,060
to paint a little bit of a picture here

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,610
when let's say a project has been closed

00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,310
on we have these sort of proto stories

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,920
that come over that we're used to create

00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,420
you know sizing for us to estimate the

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,750
number of hours it will take to do

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,280
certain things and at that stage you

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,840
know we're kind of reading through them

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
and we're thinking about what they mean

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,670
and asking some initial questions during

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,090
kick off the eggs but then things kind

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,830
of get real serious with my designers

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,870
you know some of the guys who work for

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,760
us who do a lot of the planning we get a

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,740
lot of questions about like you know

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,420
when would I create a user story when is

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,820
it appropriate to get started I see a

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,010
lot of hesitancy that happens and the

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,220
reason is that designers tend to be

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,110
visual people more so than word people

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,000
you know they might use words for

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,670
emphasis but at the same time they don't

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,770
really focus on putting things down so

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,690
I've taken kind of a militant answer all

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,430
the time if you want to know when to

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,810
create user stories that should be the

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,930
first thing you do it should be done in

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:19,270
parallel with everything else that

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,130
you're trying to handle I really think

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,430
user stories complement wireframes

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,780
naturally and I put these two graphics

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,180
up there to kinda trying to illustrate

00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,580
some points if you look off on the right

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,920
you know that's a wireframe right we add

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,320
annotations to wireframes those

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,500
annotations naturally can become user

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,830
stories not just because you know

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,290
they're there okay but annotations tend

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,570
to let's just say explain some of the

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,190
intricacies of a design and they tend to

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,540
be the sorts of things that developers

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,100
really need to know about like what

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,560
happens when I click that button how

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,410
does the interactivity occur so what we

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,310
always say is that they go hand in hand

00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,410
annotations for a wireframe should

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,700
always be reflecting user stories that

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,640
doesn't mean you shouldn't have other

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,920
user stories right but it's kind of a

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,750
nice visual for you know getting the

00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,550
picture in your mind for how they make

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:14,650
their way from from one side to the

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:16,990
other so how do i organize user stories

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,090
okay for a lot of us we have

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,620
wireframing process is where maybe

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,059
there's a home page there's a bunch of

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,740
landing pages you know we've already

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,309
spelled them out for how they're going

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,200
to do the one big change that we've you

00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:31,290
know kind of had to have is you know to

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,280
tell people to organize them in saugus

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,620
describe what it's like to go through

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,500
four or five pages that are part of the

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,960
registration process make sure that

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,179
we've iterated that story before we move

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,650
on that's the only part that's really

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,840
required to change in thinking for our

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,940
developers is the idea that you want to

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,740
make your way to some endpoint before

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,950
you move on and try to normalize

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:58,080
everything else it's you know kind of

00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:00,340
had a let's say a big impact from

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,320
another perspective and that's of the

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,350
stakeholder the idea that they can look

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,510
at multiple pages in this arc that are

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,550
coming together and they can make sure

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,050
that those things are consistent rather

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:16,000
than just focusing on a set of

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:18,580
disconnected landing pages so how do I

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,650
share user stories okay one of my goals

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,970
always is to make sure that our clients

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,790
are participating in the construction of

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,170
stories you know my degrees were in

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,780
English and Philosophy I think of a

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,370
pretty well spoken person but when i'm

00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,650
sharing user stories with a client i'm

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,630
constantly being corrected nothing i can

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,760
say is good enough there's days where it

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,580
feels like that and the reason is that

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,160
this is the story of what of something

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,710
that they care very much about there's a

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,480
very specific way that they want things

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,370
stated when you can start putting

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,070
stories in front of them that just

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,200
aligns you with what's they're expecting

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,970
which is a good thing and maybe in the

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,460
first time you sit down to do it you

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,260
know that that's kind of rough right but

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,650
the third or the fourth time you're

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,580
using the same language as them you

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,760
expectations have been adjusted on both

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,830
sides and so that's a way of getting on

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,929
the same page which is usually a little

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,620
bit more effective than than other ways

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:18,670
of doing things so I put just in terms

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,080
of you know decreasing importance a list

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,420
of the things that we usually do so a

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,190
shared desktop literally sitting down

00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,990
writing stories together is the most

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,330
effective process we have it's when we

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,830
use all the time shared spreadsheets is

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,299
really the number to the idea that

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,399
you could take a spreadsheet that I've

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,140
been working on pick up on my stories

00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,269
start writing them yourselves we can

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,710
track the changes and see what the other

00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:42,830
one is done you know that's a big deal

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,720
third is wikis I don't like wikis as

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,250
much just because they're not they don't

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,169
have a forced structure you can kind of

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,809
do anything our stories tend to become

00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,390
bizarre for folks who you know don't

00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,070
have experience with that floor mat over

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,470
time but yeah they can be effective

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,120
tools and then sometimes doing it in

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,710
front of a group can be effective I

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,019
simply do that the least because we

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,549
visit our clients offices a lot less

00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:06,889
frequently than we do the other things

00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:09,340
but sometimes I'll have a group of 10 to

00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:11,539
15 stakeholders and people are offering

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,630
perspectives on certain parts of the

00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:16,700
system that's a good way to make sure

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,230
you get those right and finally email

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,179
and downloadable documents sometimes

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,370
people ask me to email them right user

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,019
stories I try to cheat I try to tell

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,399
them no I can't download those there's

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:29,659
no way you have to use the shared

00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:31,850
documents but that's just how it is so a

00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:33,559
common objection I get from designers

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,779
like what they growls about when I say

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,880
look we're doing user stories and

00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,100
they'll say it takes a lot more time and

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,230
i'll say yeah at first it does but we

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,029
always make up for it in terms of

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,070
development you know by the time we get

00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:48,200
to where we're building things out we've

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,419
got this huge backlog with all of these

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,760
stories and developers can go to town on

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:55,340
it developers having to do less research

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,840
is a lot cheaper than having designers

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,220
put some stuff to put together their

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,159
notes in a structured format those

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,409
animations atmost add on another common

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,760
outcome that we have is another thing

00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,980
people are worrying about is how do we

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,240
hand them off to developers and the

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,519
answer really is you don't you know you

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,639
should be involving project managers at

00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,860
that stage during design on getting them

00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:20,809
to size stories getting them to do some

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,659
of the planning way ahead of time before

00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,159
it's time to start working on stuff on

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:27,169
when you're able to do that your backlog

00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,200
is completely sized you can literally

00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:32,029
jump to development okay right I mean

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,000
once you start getting near the end of

00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:37,429
design we tend to shoot for ninety

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,809
percent design meaning we've got ninety

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:41,000
percent of our design deliverables in

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,159
place prior to starting to hand things

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,570
off to developers really but you know

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,549
again with great communication

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:51,590
in project management that's that that's

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:53,419
usually a pretty easy process so so now

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,059
we get to the fun part I'm going to see

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,740
how far my voice projects but Mike did a

00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,600
good job of kind of giving us an overall

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,720
sort of bird's eye view of the agile

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,889
process and how Shaolin is adopted it

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,049
Blake did a good job of explaining that

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,610
it does start with the sales process all

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,990
the way till the end of the process but

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,269
we're really here at this point because

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:15,320
of this development so let's prepare to

00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:16,820
set our phasers to stun sizing the user

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,100
stories is really the most important

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,039
part as project manager I get this very

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,440
long list of user stories or backlog if

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,360
you will and my goal right away as

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,700
project managers identify any faulty

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,320
user stories these are basically user

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,879
stories that I don't think are defined

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,549
well enough maybe a little it too big or

00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:36,649
just need more definition so at that

00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:38,149
point I take it back to the clients and

00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,980
order developers and try to help them

00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:42,470
understand how can we cut this down how

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,820
can we make this more digestible and the

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,169
purpose of doing that is just so that

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,850
everyone's on the same page and we're

00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,440
not trying to introduce a user story to

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,629
the process that's really just too big

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,399
to handle in a sprint that's really

00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:54,980
grooving the backlog is what we call it

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,960
on the other side is I actually as a

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,389
project manager only I do not show my

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,399
developers is there's a business value

00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:02,960
assigned each user story and this goes

00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,250
back to that Fibonacci scale that we

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,830
were talking about earlier and this is

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,840
done by the clients they go from zero

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,460
all the way up to epic that helps me as

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,720
a project manager know what's really the

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,190
important features that we want to

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,809
accomplish in this project but also to

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,919
help me prioritize which ones we should

00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:20,419
focus on first so at that point we get

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,830
to something called user poker but at

00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:23,539
trailing and this is actually the

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,639
purpose of user poker is really just to

00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,610
have some fun I like to have two to

00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:29,539
three developers together with me and

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,149
ideally the reason is just to have a

00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,470
really broad spectrum of kind of how

00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:35,059
developers might think of a user story

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,919
and how they might evaluate it and I

00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,830
actually keep it really simple i use a

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,419
google doc and in column a i leave blank

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,190
column b c and d i put the developers

00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:45,379
name and then what happens is that i

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,980
take each user story I plop it into

00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:50,419
column a and I say it out loud

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,970
developers here they kind of digest it a

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,760
little bit and then I go three two one

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,649
go and each one of those developers in

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,400
their column put in their Fibonacci

00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,830
scales so

00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,120
of how they rate it as far as effort at

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,040
that point it becomes really fun because

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,740
you get to see how different developers

00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,150
sort of rate on effort a user story and

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,610
kind of help understand how we can come

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,680
to a sort of consensus decide what is

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,080
the actual effort required for this user

00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,850
story so this is a process we use quite

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,040
a bit of trial and we find that's very

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,050
fun and effective of really finding out

00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,700
what is the pure value of how to use a

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,260
user story and what does it requires

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,920
effort and again these are points on

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:30,710
effort not on time after we've done the

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,630
user stories poker and we've got

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,030
basically our backlog now of our

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,310
business value and are now user story

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,690
effort value we begin to sprint and I

00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,250
think we all kind of know what sprint is

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,480
Mike touched on a little bit it's just a

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,760
period of time and which we actually

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,530
start development all Sprint's start off

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,540
with a kickoff and that's where we

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,100
include the clients myself and the

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,570
developers to kind of get out any sort

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,600
of last minute clarification that might

00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:55,850
be required on our user stories we also

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,860
that point identify based upon business

00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,950
value and where the user story efforts

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,080
can intersect decide a total amount of

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,030
effort points that we want to assign for

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,010
the Sprint sometimes it's a hundred

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,010
sometimes it's 200 but what this

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,660
eventually becomes is our burn down rate

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,000
so after assigning our points to a

00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,590
sprint we basically begin begin the

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,240
sprint and again we try not to do

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,460
sprints more than two weeks I like a

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,590
week but each square each day during the

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,910
Sprint I I do a scrum and I think

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,190
everyone here kind of understands how a

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:29,420
scrum works I take 15 minutes no more

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,740
than no more no less and then I I ask

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,570
what did you do yesterday what are you

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,580
doing today and in other any obstacles

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,440
if at any point in time during the scrum

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,360
I feel like a developer's getting a

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,830
little bit to sort of technical I stop

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,930
them right there we move on we say

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,460
that's a tech huddle so after a scrum

00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,140
either right afterwards or later in the

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,850
day I'll have a tech huddle where we can

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,740
get a little bit more involved share

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,910
screens and kind of figure out what is

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,820
it the developers trying to accomplish

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:55,130
and seeing how we can fix it my actually

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,480
favorite part of agile is during a

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,670
sprint I really don't get any client

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,130
involvement it's pretty clear what we're

00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,580
doing the expectations are set so they

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,230
can't really inject any of their

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,060
requirements or concerns during that

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,500
sprint and that's pretty much a benefit

00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,210
for a project manager

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,220
after a sprint is complete I then looked

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,750
at the burn down rate again back to the

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,150
user stories how many of those points

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,799
were completed in that time period

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,840
during that time also I do a client demo

00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,460
for review and I point and click and

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,410
decide do you accept this or do you not

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,540
and if they accept it great remove it

00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,520
from the backlog if they don't we add it

00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,080
back to the backlog for the purpose of

00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,270
potentially adding it to a new sprint

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,799
and then again we just go through that

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,809
process over and over it's pretty

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,780
straightforward nothing too fancy about

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:49,559
it so with that being said thank you for

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:50,610
all your time and any questions okay

00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,049
we've got through things a little bit

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,760
faster maybe than what we thought but

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:55,760
yeah we'd love to we'd love to talk

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:28,629
I think so um yeah I'll put one up that

00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,190
we can kind of look at and if anybody

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:31,619
has any specific questions about it this

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,879
is a screenshot of the one that I did

00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,169
this for a website that we're working on

00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:38,050
currently and you can you repeat that

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:40,419
question yeah just so everybody knows

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:45,609
what he was asking is can I show a

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:47,770
sample sorry you know chart for tracking

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:49,659
user stories it might actually help us

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,280
if anybody does have questions we have a

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,750
microphone there you know the back the

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,790
room maybe just feel free to get up and

00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,770
lineup that will make sure everybody

00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,750
hears but yeah that's what it looks like

00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,270
and usually there's you know 100 or so

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,470
on you'll see on this one we've actually

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,030
rated business value and technical

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,800
effort you know using some of those

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,150
scales this is what it actually looks

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,220
like when we start putting those things

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:16,569
together what we're always looking for

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,609
is hi business value low technical

00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:20,079
effort that's how you rate a great story

00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,160
that's one of the ones you want to

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,660
include in your first sprints because

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,050
then you're setting yourself up for

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,290
success when you find ones that have low

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:32,920
value well even high value and high

00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:34,569
effort you want to wait if you can so um

00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,970
but that's what one of these sheets

00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:40,960
looks like and I don't know if I can

00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:43,839
scale out but hopefully it helps next

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,530
question could you talk about the

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,140
process you've gone through and how the

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,270
scoring the efforts values have improved

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,940
or did you get it right from the first

00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,099
time and and determining the Sprint's

00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,660
like how much you can include in a

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:03,339
sprint yeah what I'd say is the process

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,250
we went through to get this implemented

00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,650
was an organizational shift of a very

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,000
high order I had good friends who had

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,710
been working with me for a very long

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,799
time and for many of them I had to help

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,910
them move on you know two roles and

00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,170
other companies because they weren't

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,020
getting it and they were never going to

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,059
get

00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,040
you have to have good leadership to have

00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:27,089
good agile processes that's what I think

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,059
you have to have people who are not

00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:33,180
going to rush to build stuff you just

00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:35,140
don't really get anywhere there

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,240
everything has to be a little bit

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,900
measured and and that's a second

00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,730
reaction to some folks so I would say

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,920
our shift towards agile started close to

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,329
three years ago i'd say we started

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:52,359
seeing results roughly a year ago and it

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,950
was very painful at times but again I

00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:58,329
think it's very satisfying when you

00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:00,430
start to see the optimist and you know

00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:12,730
just leave it at that what are the

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:14,410
questions okay so the question is with

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,690
billing and documentation what's

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,220
different around a normal client the

00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,170
answer is nothing most of our work is

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,349
done on a time in materials basis we

00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:26,140
bill you know a certain number of

00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:28,990
dollars an hour for what we do so it's

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,030
the same it's just that our billing

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:34,569
tends to be very accurate at this point

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:36,450
it's very rare that we go over or we're

00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:39,069
coming less than ten percent off of

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,450
where we were originally so we're going

00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:43,540
to switch to just the questions at the

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,339
mic so this goes back to the sales part

00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,089
of it when you're going through all of

00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:50,680
that exercise of estimating are you

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,720
actually doing that as like a paid

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,839
discovery phase are you actually getting

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,650
like some sort of request a proposal and

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,240
you're going through all that effort

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,170
because because I know how much effort

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,880
that takes so where are you doing that

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,309
and because then you're having to come

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,710
up with like kind of a fixed bid rightly

00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:10,480
so that's not about that because that to

00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:14,319
me is really the mystery behind all of

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:20,500
this yeah it's it's not part of the paid

00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:22,630
discovery phase but it's um it's when

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,359
we're trying to scope it all out that's

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,420
it see a very initial phases and the

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,400
initial discussions with the client and

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,730
it's not as involved as the development

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,280
sizing exercise

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,280
it's a matter of sitting down grabbing a

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,340
couple developers and and making sure

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,020
that we're not over promising anything

00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,410
just remember we've got some pretty

00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,930
bright guys on our team so it's never

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,790
that much effort for us to have to go

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,530
through something like this if we know

00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,240
that there's a part of it that we're not

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:58,340
going to get right without that we will

00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:01,220
include our own paid development cycle

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,630
or discovery cycle as part of a part of

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,070
a proposal like if you're trying to

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,830
create an API to some system that you

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,450
don't know or something like that so I

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,790
another common thing that will do is

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,380
will say look you have like up to a

00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,060
hundred hours of Pi and that will be

00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,980
spent on this or we're going to do like

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,859
up to eight wireframes will build

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,100
logical separators in just to give

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:23,540
ourselves some protections it I mean

00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,070
building boundaries and having

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,600
constraints is a great thing and when

00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,580
people understand them they get very

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,640
creative about how to work within them

00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,440
and it just leads places that you know

00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,440
people wouldn't if they thought it's a

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:42,530
buffet so that's kind of kind of why we

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:44,840
do it that way I think for sharing we've

00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:49,430
been implementing a gel for a while and

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:52,550
we've noticed that design and specs

00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,460
creation like UX design and stuff like

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,510
that really blocks or way when we're

00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,000
trying to apply that with agile so we're

00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,250
kind of we've kind of moved it away from

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,950
the edge of process and we're making it

00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,960
before we start the sprints per code so

00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:14,600
my question is do you guys do anything

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:18,619
to get design work and design spec for

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,140
usability with agile or is just the

00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,000
development part absolutely the two

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,910
things happen hand in hand I don't think

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,330
you can build a great site unless you

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,340
have a great design process I can

00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,140
totally understand some organizations

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:36,320
struggle with the idea of doing agile

00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,210
during design or that you know you ex

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,920
can happen you know before you're

00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,440
actually building clickable prototypes

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,880
and things right it's really hard to

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,920
assess an experience at that stage

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,960
so the way we approach it is that we're

00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,170
going to create user stories in parallel

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,910
with wireframes what that does is it 10

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,099
sets the stage so that our mock-ups

00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,140
later on are going to be a little bit

00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,869
more informed we'll be spending a little

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,220
less time on those when we get to the

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,589
point we're actually building the

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,690
interfaces if we were to find that like

00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:09,390
you know hey like we completely got it

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:12,059
wrong it's ugly yeah that's a potential

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,640
outcome but that's never happened and at

00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:17,849
what we see is the opposite clients just

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,380
kind of know what's going on we tend to

00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:22,309
be thinking down the road of like being

00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,900
a partner where we really understand

00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:27,329
what the outcomes are that they seek at

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,710
the end and so just given the fact that

00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,059
there's a lot of folks who are thinking

00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,220
down the same track because we're

00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:35,490
building these user stories that tends

00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,640
to solve a few usability issues long

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,140
before we even get to development so

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,849
yeah that that's how we do but we don't

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,349
consider that a blocker that's not

00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:48,750
that's not hard for us yeah there's just

00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:50,640
curious when you have a user story or

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,890
more than one user story they get in

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,839
progress and then inevitably takes a lot

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,819
longer than you expect doesn't get

00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,529
completed within the sprint what sort of

00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:01,529
mechanism you use used to roll it to the

00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:03,029
next sprint or what do you do yeah

00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:05,279
generally you know it's a time period

00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:07,619
right so if it's not done that's really

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:09,690
just an indication of may be either the

00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,990
effort points weren't assigned correctly

00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:15,809
or maybe we need to add more effort

00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,519
points in a sprint but generally if it

00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,200
doesn't get completed that's it pencils

00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,789
down you got to put it back in the

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,710
backlog and then decide if you want to

00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:27,210
add it to the next sprint thank you hi

00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,220
there as a consultant sort of walking

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,740
into a client that wants to do agile

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,599
sprints can you talk a little to the

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,000
idea of sort of evolving into the

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,319
process versus hey we're ready we want

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,490
to start we just bought Jarrod sprint

00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,490
zeros tomorrow go oh

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:50,500
that's a part of the threatening

00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:51,730
sounding situation in a way so on the

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,620
way I would answer it is just to say

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,170
look you know everybody gets some place

00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:59,860
right we don't all start off perfect and

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,310
that goes with our processes as well as

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,140
was a relationships we go to people and

00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,400
you know some of the longest some of the

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,890
clients drawings been working with for

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,990
like six or seven years now you know it

00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,760
started horribly like something

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,190
god-awful happen in the fur that cost

00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,010
them money embarrassed us like threats

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,360
of lawsuits and stuff but over time you

00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:23,560
know we kind of learn to work together

00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,400
and keep things going I'll just say that

00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:29,110
experience is a teacher and when you

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,720
walk in on a first day and you know

00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:35,710
folks are ready to go you just try your

00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,110
hardest and if it doesn't work you try

00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,970
again okay and I don't think it's any

00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,530
more complex in that right like one of

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,390
the things I tell folks on our team all

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,450
the time is just remember to swing the

00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:48,310
bat like you can't just push this aside

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,610
for a few months and then hope you're

00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:55,870
going to catch up on it I will notice

00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:57,430
and make you feel guilty but before it

00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,230
even you know gets anywhere it's just

00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:06,070
try and that that's fifty percent of

00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:09,070
implementing the practice this question

00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:12,370
is regarding team dynamics you have a

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:14,820
team and invariably there's developers I

00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,810
can do a lot more points than others and

00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,370
let's say that developer maybe is on

00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:21,400
vacation your burn down chart doesn't

00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:23,050
quite affect the reality of it what kind

00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,420
of tips have you guys experienced

00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,010
perhaps that you can share that to deal

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,290
with such situation

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,740
biggest variances that we see are

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,570
actually generational I don't mean to

00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,070
sound weird about it but like Gen X

00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:40,160
developer's do things a different way

00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:42,050
than millennial developers on what you

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,700
tend to find is that the kinds of

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,070
solutions people will want to implement

00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,830
are greatly influenced by what they've

00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,660
seen in the past and it's really true

00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,550
there's generations to technology and

00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,410
the solutions people may have

00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,500
implemented a long time ago like write a

00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,060
query might be very different these days

00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,950
you know use drupal's database

00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:05,300
subtraction layer and put something else

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:06,860
in so where we see the biggest variances

00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,170
is and stuff like that when you have a

00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:12,500
different style of programmer coming in

00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:16,130
we don't really do vacations at relic so

00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,750
like that's ever again well you know the

00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,890
8020 will you have eight you know twenty

00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,390
miss any developers do eighty percent of

00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:23,660
their work and when they're not they're

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:27,830
kind of yeah my other question is do as

00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:30,310
a rule or maybe hype story high point

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,650
stories you should break up into smaller

00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,390
story points for us forgiving sprint or

00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,680
it's just you can assign a twelve or

00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,780
twenty one to somebody that's

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,430
recommended practice we have a

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:44,240
designation for something that must be

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:45,980
broken down it's epic and I learned this

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,100
from my good friend Zack who works for

00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,720
some giant University and anytime we get

00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,940
to the point where something's epic it

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,010
must be broken and we don't care it just

00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:58,820
automatically it's like accusing

00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:01,310
somebody being Hitler you know IRC forum

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,130
you know just a conversation over let's

00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:07,660
move so that that's our designation and

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:10,430
basically epic would mean over two weeks

00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,790
so there's a relationship between points

00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:15,430
and time eventually kind of we're just

00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,740
saying once you get into a gray area

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,270
that that's it there's any ambiguity

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,120
whatsoever you have to bring it down it

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,240
has to be in digestible chunks and sort

00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,240
of

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,090
sort of put into a situation where if a

00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,100
developer can't deal with it in two

00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,900
weeks then we have to rethink how that

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,460
user story works or that user story

00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,350
becomes a saga if you really think about

00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:43,230
it and at that point you're breaking

00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:46,890
down user stories below that saga this

00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:49,890
is sort of building on the design side

00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,480
of things for agile we're we're trying

00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,170
we're experimenting with options where

00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,570
we do everything using some sort of

00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:02,910
agile framework even content inventory

00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:05,280
and audit content strategy modeling we

00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:09,540
haven't looked at assigning points

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,460
necessarily for effort or value is that

00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,530
something that you've done like

00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:20,070
throughout this whole process for the

00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:24,200
design for the US side of things yeah so

00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,200
kind of going back to this wireframe

00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:29,190
user stories and wireframes go hand in

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,900
hand if you look real carefully at that

00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:33,000
spreadsheet you'll see the technical

00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,010
complexities are that's you know

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,950
development effort and usually we'll

00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,690
assign business value as well it's just

00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:42,330
that we do it sporadically we're at the

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,670
design stage okay in other words we're

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,550
not going to have a project manager

00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,740
formerly sizing every story within X

00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,500
number of hours or something what we're

00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,600
going to have is us reaching certain

00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,390
points and saying look let's sit down in

00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,650
size this first because we might get you

00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:00,540
beginning to the point where things are

00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,060
way out of hand that's really just an

00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,400
awareness okay what needs to be there

00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,440
now we have other parts of a process

00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,660
that you know this doesn't cover like

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,440
content type bought it and use a role

00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,900
audit but a lot of that kind of emerges

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,600
from what we've done with with stories

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,920
by the time we have wireframes and by

00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,480
the time we have user stories in place

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,820
that's eighty percent of that's mapped

00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,620
out already anyway so we don't

00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,360
necessarily need to think about those as

00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:31,980
budget centers oh yeah that makes sense

00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,200
okay cool I saw on your spreadsheet that

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,570
you have like for the business value

00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,450
like one and then 50 and then

00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,920
a hundred it you don't really go in

00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:44,250
between those three settings that look

00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,680
like is that a common thing like low

00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,540
medium high pretty much well yeah I mean

00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,400
yeah let's just remember it's all

00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:54,180
relative and you could use any scale low

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,070
medium higher fine we tend to stick with

00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,480
a Fibonacci scale the only times we try

00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,810
to break from it or when a client starts

00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,030
spouting off numbers i went to 73 you

00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:05,400
know we can't account for that but it

00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,290
means something to them and as long as

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,790
it means something to the person you're

00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,440
saying it you know hopefully they can

00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:14,010
remember the difference between is 73

00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,540
and 69 but that's what it is it doesn't

00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:19,170
have to mean anything outside of that

00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:21,540
context do you find yourself using these

00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,390
numbers at the end of the day as an

00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:30,090
evaluation tool of your own employees no

00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:31,770
no that'd be cruel did so I mean honor

00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,910
they could talk about what evaluation

00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,000
cycles are but that has nothing to with

00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:45,270
agile okay one other one of the question

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:46,530
uh nevermind I ok so with this

00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,450
spreadsheet I was just getting a little

00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:51,680
lost between the spreadsheet and the

00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:54,600
wireframes is it that these are grouped

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,090
like actually if you go back to the

00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,800
spreadsheet I was looking at that and I

00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:02,940
wasn't seeing how I would turn that into

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,490
a wire frame is it that creative booking

00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,870
stories that's a page and this is all

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,720
the contents that's going to go on the

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,460
create a booking page well where it says

00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,890
like booking strange story we consider

00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:19,080
that a saga the saga again is that

00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:22,440
detailed journal of a user's experience

00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,090
as they go through your site and we call

00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,320
them a saga to imply that you know

00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:30,360
there's some traveling going on right so

00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,910
with every saga you know you can kind of

00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,800
think of it that way like a saga could

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,150
be about a single page describes the

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,130
interaction that's going to happen on it

00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,320
you know what other things but the

00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,810
relationship is tenuous at best right

00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,250
there's sometimes when you have like a

00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,630
chicken in the egg problem should i draw

00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,090
it first should i write up the stories

00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,560
for it first all i know is that you know

00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,340
after a day or two you ought to have

00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,780
some users

00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,360
reason you oughta have some wire frames

00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,550
so it thought one does not have to

00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,740
proceed the other it's just they can't

00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,150
really exist without each other the one

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,710
requirement that we really have her

00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,270
designers is just there better be some

00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,640
annotations I only see black-and-white

00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,840
drawings that nobody can explain you

00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,980
know if somebody gets into a meeting

00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,170
they're like oh well I don't even know i

00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,680
did that i want to hear that that

00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:15,600
implies you don't have a plan and that's

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:21,930
what we do is we think and we plan that

00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:26,090
that's what design is okay thanks i'm

00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:30,060
intrigued by the idea that using agile

00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:32,040
for the design aspect of it before you

00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:36,620
start development but i was just

00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:38,550
wondering how would you handle technical

00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:42,480
requirements you know before you start

00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:44,400
developing such as a custom integration

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,820
custom integrations with external

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,390
systems how would you cover how would

00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:58,520
you capture that kind of information as

00:51:51,390 --> 00:52:01,140
part of the your agile process so i

00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,440
cants out a few ways from the sales

00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:08,640
perspective we recently had a client

00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,440
come and say integrator site with this

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,510
third party platform they have an API

00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,150
just do it tell us how much work is

00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:17,340
involved so I made Blake answer that and

00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:19,350
I kind of knew the answer because I was

00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:22,050
able to read the API but I wanted to see

00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:25,050
how he would run with that ball and so

00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:26,580
on he set up a meeting we itemized like

00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,050
the high-level requirements like the

00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,510
user logs in there logged into this

00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,890
other thing user can easily go over from

00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,600
one system together we can display the

00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:36,300
scores of the user with user always has

00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,310
an account blah blah blah and we sat

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,990
down with developers size it and

00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,420
developers of course immediately pointed

00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,190
out the gaps and then they sat down they

00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,810
looked at the API unfortunately as a

00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,760
well-defined API so there wasn't like

00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:50,100
the hardest thing on earth and that's

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,550
how we came up with a size and a size

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,380
communicates cost and time to to do it

00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,230
you know but that's what was going to be

00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,580
needed now the second thing I'd answer

00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,380
is you know there's another part to our

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,260
process it's called core configuration

00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,270
where we look at a Drupal site we've got

00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,330
this list of like 150 or so best

00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:11,190
practices that we follow and we would

00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,230
use that really to determine do we need

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,670
a custom module can handle a different

00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:17,850
way what are the other cool things that

00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:19,830
could happen and by you know sort of

00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:23,010
focusing at that level okay we're also

00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:24,960
able to sort of like make this

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:27,030
harmonious decision right about how

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,000
would that fit in with everything else

00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:32,280
that we have going on so with queer

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,930
configuration you know it's part

00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,570
decision-making tool and part

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:37,890
documenting and that makes it pretty

00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,900
easy for us to understand if there's

00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:42,060
other Drupal modules I could be used you

00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,130
know or maybe we use the services module

00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,870
to handle some of the authentication and

00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:48,900
stuff and you know that that kind of

00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:52,140
makes that simpler but then it's moving

00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,820
into sprints and moving into you know

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,210
just kind of getting things done you

00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:59,130
know in assessing with the with client

00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:01,500
what's important to kind of recognize

00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,990
there is that it always starts before

00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,700
the engagement we don't need this to be

00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:09,660
in a developer's hands and say just

00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:11,160
figure it out whenever we do that you

00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,050
know just I get these little hairs and

00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,780
they raised in the back of my head and

00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,850
it's horrible we're able to get away

00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:20,190
from all of that because we you know can

00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:22,230
can handle it at multiple levels and go

00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,590
out to make its way down the stream but

00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:29,640
how do you capture requirements like you

00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:32,790
know if you send a query to the external

00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:35,250
system and the times out then you need

00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:38,660
to take this stone or you need to

00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:41,880
respond it gets documented in the wiki

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,530
it gets explained you know in user

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,200
stories for what how it's going to

00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,780
behave and right now in the sprints and

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,790
built out so we would capture that

00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,380
information in our wiki and I guys if

00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,030
you're interested stop by the trial on

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,170
booth and I'll show you how we document

00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:59,160
alright thank you I don't recall if you

00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,070
mentioned earlier in your presentation

00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,780
but are any of you scrum certified say

00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,780
for instance with the scrum master

00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,720
alliance and do you see a value in that

00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,860
treaty yeah I see a lot of value in it

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,210
Ellen's been around for 10 years and

00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,130
people really like to poach our

00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,650
employees and so every time I get

00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,710
somebody certification

00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:21,380
gone what I try to do is sort of be the

00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:23,870
trainer and lead people in a certain

00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:27,290
direction and then push them towards

00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:29,810
getting it people seeking certification

00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,430
tend to pick up what is a lot of

00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,660
professional credits just by virtue of

00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,460
their role you know there's a certain

00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,010
number of hours you need for to be a

00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,570
certified scrum master and so usually

00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:41,150
over the course of a year you get you

00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:43,910
know X percent of those and just by

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,440
being a project manager but I don't make

00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,810
it a requirement what we do it's not

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,450
just that you know this kind of like

00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:52,880
fear of poaching it's just that I think

00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:56,330
agile evolves and I don't know if people

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,790
recognize that they think scrum is there

00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:00,050
and it just works a certain way but to

00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,000
be real honest with you there are

00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:05,060
technologies that emerge all the time

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,890
that automate parts of this they make

00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,170
certain questions easier to answer and

00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,750
experience plays a huge role in it too

00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:15,770
knowing who the people you're talking to

00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:17,270
is art has a huge / let's say impact on

00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:19,610
you know the perception around what's

00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:22,670
required in terms of effort have we done

00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:25,520
this before and from that perspective I

00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:29,420
think certification has a role other

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,030
organizations / value it and we kind of

00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:37,790
see it as one of a sort of a spectrum of

00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:40,370
things people could bring thank you if

00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:46,310
you all tasked out your user stories or

00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:49,820
are they just a user story no but we

00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:51,980
think about it okay and why do you not

00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,780
because how do you know where the

00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,280
developer is and that particular user

00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,710
story and like you said if they don't

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,600
finish it would you not want to split

00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,490
the story so they got credit for some of

00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,920
the work and then the rest of the credit

00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:06,740
could be applied to the next sprint well

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,230
user story becomes a task okay like at

00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,970
that level we will take it we will paste

00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,760
it into our task management system and

00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,680
it will be there it's just that the idea

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,240
of tasking out implies like there's a

00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,970
certain developer that's going to get it

00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,620
right and the truth is we've got three

00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,840
or four developers assigned a project

00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,130
they're working through a series of when

00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,579
people come to deal with Trillin they're

00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:29,979
paying for a series of sprints that

00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:35,469
kind of like how we calculate what we're

00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:37,089
going to do and it's just we're not like

00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:38,890
we never have it in our minds like hey

00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:41,079
you know so-and-so is perfect for this

00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:42,670
let's have him do it what it is is we

00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,410
write the things we figure out who on

00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,759
the team can do this and then you know

00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,979
sometimes we just invest in our guys

00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:49,719
like you know you're going to need some

00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:51,430
time to figure out how to build this

00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:54,069
thing and so will push them in that

00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:57,749
direction but it it's a little less task

00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,749
oriented than what it might seem I

00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:05,910
remembered okay if you've got someone

00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:08,079
that wants sprints longer than two weeks

00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:09,969
have you ever had a client that's had

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,529
that like they said they wanted to say

00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:12,729
we want to do a three week or four week

00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,739
because we've just got a lot of stuff do

00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:17,709
you force them to break it apart no it's

00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:20,229
um it's a horrible idea I'm sorry I just

00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:22,029
tell them it's a horrible idea to try

00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:25,269
and go further than that and I'd suggest

00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:29,849
that we do and they usually do thank you

00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,849
so either questions

00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:47,800
this sprint does include a review or the

00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:49,390
day before we say pencils down as i like

00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,130
to say then that next day is when i do

00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,660
the review with the client that

00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,330
following what we generally like to plan

00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:58,090
on mondays is sort of the back grooming

00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:59,890
for the the log to see what we'd like to

00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:01,990
now include in that next sprint and then

00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:04,120
that Tuesday's generally when we do a

00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:06,700
kickoff meeting and we kind of run that

00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:19,900
same sort of cycle again again so the

00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:21,520
review well it's part of the review

00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,050
right I think you're asking if how do I

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,430
know if it's accepted or not or when to

00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,870
remove it from the backlog that's part

00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:27,550
of the review process which happens at

00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:29,710
the end of every sprint I sit in front

00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:31,540
the client we share a screen we look at

00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:33,940
the user story then I go through what

00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,310
they've done and then they tell me yes I

00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,750
like that or oh can we just do this then

00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,790
I go okay it's going to go back into the

00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,380
backlog doing then we decide if we want

00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:42,760
to add it in to complete at that next

00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,130
week or do you want to move on maybe to

00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,660
a different saga it's not necessarily a

00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,510
hundred percent complete right but it's

00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,010
almost there but we have to have a

00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:52,210
process if we don't have a process we

00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:55,960
can't point to it when things go wrong

00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:57,910
and it's part of the reason I think

00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,530
we're over in terms of time so we're

00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,940
going to break off but if anyone let's

00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:03,340
stop by the Chaon booth we have these

01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,960
nice keychains the stickers and all

01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:07,090
kinds of other stuff that could be your

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,150
treat for waiting till the end thanks so

01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,150
