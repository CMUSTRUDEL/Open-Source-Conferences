Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: The Battle for the Body Field
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	With Drupal's powerful content modeling tools at their disposal, most design and development teams have already converted to the gospel of structured content. Unfortunately, even the best-planned content types and presentation models fall apart when users hit the body field. Ugly ad-hoc markup creeps in, house styles evolve without planning, and critical metadata stays locked in blobs of "good enough for now" HTML.

Better HTML-focused WYSIWYG tools aren't enough, adding more and more fields to the mix only complicate editors' lives, and the principles of semantic HTML don't solve the deeper problem. The work of content modeling must extend inside the body field, not just wrap around it, and that requires a more holistic approach to the design and architecture of a Drupal site. In this session, we'll cover:

Best practices for handling semi-structured "body field" content
How content patterns can bring together designers, developers, and stakeholders
Battle-tested techniques for mapping a project's "content vocabulary" 
The latest and greatest Drupal tools for modeling flexible content
Real-world examples of these techniques and their impact on projects
I've spoken at DrupalCon and many other Web and Content Strategy conferences over the past decade, and an archive of my sessions (with quite a few videos) is up at http://lanyrd.com/profile/eaton/. I covered this topic from a technical angle at DrupalCon Austin (https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/battle-body-field-drupal-and-future-wysiwyg.html). Interest was high enough that the session overflowed, and Q&A ran half an hour past conference closing, so it's definitely a hot topic. This session is intended to focus on the UX, IA, and strategy aspects of the 'semi-structured content' problem. Rather than focusing exclusively on the technical tweaks, it will cover the ways teams can identify, model, and manage this type of content more effectivelyâ€”regardless of the module or editor they're using.

	00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,259
so for a long time especially after

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,700
starting to work with Drupal and really

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,570
getting into building out lots of big

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,619
sites with it I really had this dream I

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,380
had this conviction that we'd solved a

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,199
lot of the really fundamentally crappy

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,119
problems that the web had presented us

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,730
with how many people like we're building

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,160
out like big content websites even

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,189
medium sized content websites in like

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:37,410
the late 90s where like we actually went

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:42,329
and made HTML files did anyone yeah made

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,850
with notepad back when we put badges for

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,260
the HTML editor that we used unlike the

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,850
bottom of the webpage and everything

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,570
those were the days yeah that was also

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,219
really hellish because although we had

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,170
like complete freedom and complete

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,850
flexibility to do whatever we wanted to

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,080
on a given page it was also a giant

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,450
horrifying pain whenever we did a

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,369
redesign or whenever we decided that we

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,439
needed to adapt some of our content that

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,010
was on one page to use in another part

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,619
of the site reuse was incredibly nasty I

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,650
mean the process of redesigning a

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,920
website was basically hiring piles of

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,400
interns and just remaking hundreds to

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,750
thousands of web pages that's terrible

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,990
we've solved a lot of that in the modern

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,119
era we've solved a huge number of those

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,820
problems a lot of what we do day to day

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,509
in Drupal site building is all about

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,619
building up content types fields

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,479
structures that link these different

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,320
types of content together we've taken

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,020
all the ugly muddy blobby aspects of the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,630
stuff that lived in those big fluid HTML

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,369
files and turn them into well-defined

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,710
fields that editors can just pop open a

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,930
form and type stuff up into and have a

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,090
good time and then the theme layer

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,979
template you know pushes things through

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,630
templates and everything gets turned

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,770
into a cool responsive design it's

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,989
awesome I for a long time thought we'd

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,740
pretty much licked a lot of this problem

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,710
that when people put

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,810
nasty ugly cruddy HTML into the body

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,840
field of a piece of content that it was

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,670
user error that it was just a problem

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,130
that we were slowly but surely getting

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,840
rid of like you know Marxism is

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,760
ultimately just going to solve all of

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,440
our problems and it's just all the

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,100
little ripple effects of you know the

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,820
old system dying ooh I know no humans

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,710
HTML still there yeah that was that was

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,210
a little bit of a stretch but I always

00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,240
try to get a weird political reference

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,100
in what I can the real problem is that

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,440
even though we put tons of energy and

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,770
built fantastic tools around breaking up

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,560
these weird ugly HTML blobs into nice

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,420
structural pieces that we can manage and

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,750
pump through templates and treat a

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,590
structured data we've only really kind

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,590
of pushed the problem out to the edges

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,110
the body field that big wad of stuff

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,300
that an editor paste sin from Microsoft

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,190
Word or that somebody pops open the

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,740
WYSIWYG editor and just start slamming

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,890
on buttons until it looks right that

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,380
stuff still has all of the weird ugly

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,320
dragons and nasty bits that we tried to

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,650
solve with old HTML files moving into

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,790
this new system it's still there I

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,440
thought it was something that we could

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,000
just train people out of I thought we

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,650
could just strip more and more features

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
out of the body field if we could just

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,120
get a better WYSIWYG editor can convince

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,990
everyone just use markdown everything

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,270
would be fine that's not true and about

00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,770
probably three or four years ago there

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:50,720
was a project that broke my spirit it

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,850
really convinced me I had been looking

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,940
at it wrong it was a really really big

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,200
website about 50,000 pages of a

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,490
corporate HR intranet I mean not like a

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,020
fantastically high-profile project or

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,910
anything like that but a big

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,860
multinational organization said we've

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,740
got thousands and thousands of pages

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,770
detailing our policies our insurance

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,050
signup forms travel policy where to go

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,020
to get a replacement key card for the

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,480
door and building 59 literally

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,550
everything it had to be in it had to be

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,290
localized for 20 different countries in

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,960
different languages for all of the

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,250
European countries and

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,460
over all of the different employment

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,680
statuses HR you know like HR policies

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,319
everything that was possibly conceivably

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,270
meaning to be documented they had on

00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,419
there and it was being maintained by

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,870
hand by Dunn's of people and it was just

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,720
nasty they wanted to turn it into 50

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,759
pages super customized super

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,990
personalized they had all the user data

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,180
if people are going to be logging into

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,800
the website we could do cool stuff we

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,800
could just reduce all of that special

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,560
casing I was like yes yes structured

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,930
content fields content types roles

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,740
permissions user profiles we can do this

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,630
we have the technology super cool and it

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,030
actually was really cool they had a

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,430
great vision for it great like solid

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,320
clean design the idea was they were

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,840
going to have their actual HR team

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,789
editing all the content it wasn't going

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,800
to be like HTML designers doing crazy

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,320
stuff in there but they really actually

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
had some some very specific ideas about

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,889
what they wanted they wanted it to be

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,810
really rich they didn't want to just

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,150
have text in there they wanted to have

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,340
things like on the 401 K page there was

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,539
a calculator right in the you know right

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,759
in the body of it where you could just

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,620
are calculating stuff if you already had

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,479
your personal information entered in it

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,699
would even pre populate it with what

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,360
your 401 k data ones it would show you

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:49,990
all this cool stuff and with just 50

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,479
pages maybe 70 by the time it ended but

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,820
the problem was none of this stuff was

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,139
predictable out of it was like followed

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,659
the kinds of structures we would think

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,000
of using templates to solve or you know

00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,680
using all of drupal's normal tools we

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,620
couldn't say well what's this type of

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,930
page well there is no type of page it's

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,240
just these pages and it's just all fluid

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,699
and crazy we just needed all of the

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,580
structure but they needed total

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,770
flexibility it was a little bit

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,659
frustrated and then on top of that they

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,340
needed the personalization stuff to be

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,009
very fine-grained I thought oh well

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,050
perhaps we can like layer you know maybe

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,729
some access controls on top of Drupal's

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,469
fields you know when there's a piece of

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,719
information that's for one type of

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,830
person we could put it in one field and

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:35,260
for another type of person who could go

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,029
in another field no no they like at the

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,430
sentence level they wanted to

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,260
personalize it so this particular

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,050
raise might only appear for a manager

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,790
and for a retail employee this bullet

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,160
point would appear in a bullet whist in

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,530
the text but wouldn't for anyone else it

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,680
was a really bad match for a lot of the

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,150
tools i'd spent so much time deeply

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,400
investing in and getting really good at

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,140
using it was really frustrating but at

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,990
the same time they knew that it was a

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,880
dead end just to throw editors and raw

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,700
mark up at the problem because that

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,990
wasn't sustainable they needed basically

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,820
all of the power of in flexibility and

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,530
reusability and structure of the fields

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,590
and the content types and the templates

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,120
but they also needed the flexibility of

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,680
basically raw markup and the ability to

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,420
go in there and tweak and twiddle things

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,280
at a very fine level and they also

00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,740
needed the editorial interface to feel

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,320
simple and smooth like writing something

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,690
not like clicking together a bunch of

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Lego blocks into something resembling a

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,320
sentence because they wanted to be

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,030
natural and smooth and easy to read and

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,410
also easy to translate into other

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,400
languages once they'd written the

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:46,300
canonical version in one language that

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,920
broke me we did solve it it took some

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,170
time and it took all it took some smart

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,750
folks like putting their heads together

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,580
I I won't go into the details but it was

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,550
a crazy combination of like input

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,990
filters ckeditor plugins panels for

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,870
certain layouts special like block stuff

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,550
embedding a lot of different pieces

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,580
ended up getting brought to bear on that

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,310
but it really got me thinking why was

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,820
this so tricky why was this so hard why

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:20,530
was it so painful that what you know it

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,480
was a big big pile of content but like

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,790
seemed like all these incredible tools

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,010
we had should have been able to like

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,630
just crack that nut what made it so

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,810
tricky and right around the same time

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,540
there was a big big splash in the world

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,920
of journalism and digital content that

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,140
got everybody's attention does anybody

00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,010
remember the snowfall article from the

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,920
New York Times does anybody still dread

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:50,980
having a client say you know like

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:52,490
snowfall if anybody remembers in in 2012

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,120
they released this in

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,740
incredibly huge deeply research article

00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,209
about a group of hikers that had gone

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,700
off into the mountains been trapped in

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,920
an avalanche and it was rich with like

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,839
data visualizations about the path

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,940
they've taken through these weird you

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,670
know winding canyons little interview

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,380
clips with the people that searched for

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,850
them and the people who discovered just

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,800
when they were missing and pieced the

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,350
story together interviews with the

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,149
hikers themselves you know a little fly

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,950
outs of the equipment they were using

00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,330
and how some of it broke down on them

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,010
and some of it was critical for their

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,260
survival it was a really really

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,360
interesting and rich piece of very

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,450
compelling narrative and everybody loved

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,870
it um and I started looking at it and

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,970
it's like wow so why aren't we always

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,399
doing this kind of stuff why don't we

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,200
constantly produce these things I mean

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,670
it took a lot of investment just to make

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,140
all the content for that you know

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,240
producing all those videos and

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,800
visualizations and interviews isn't

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,020
something that's cheap but it seems like

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,230
you know we should be doing this kind of

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,120
cool rich media stuff all the time and

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,100
you know if you look at you know this is

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,200
a screenshot from about halfway through

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,750
one of the chapters of this article it's

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,060
just littered with little bits like the

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,579
first time a person is mentioned in the

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,380
article their little bio appears up in

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:12,890
the sidebar right as their first

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,180
discussed not just you know somewhere in

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,589
the sidebar when you're scrolling

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,640
through but right when they're talked

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,320
about these little photos that are that

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,209
are interspersed throughout it are

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,709
actually full complete slideshows

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,029
embedded right when they start talking

00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,550
about different things that we're going

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,290
on or a particular base camp that they

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,480
ended up staying at as you know night

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,550
fell or something like that and I

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,450
realized wait a minute this is that same

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,660
weird slippery problem of trying to take

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,020
those complicated weird like structural

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,720
elements things like the 401k calculator

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,850
and the information about you know how

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,279
to how to go on your trip to Europe with

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,680
the rest of the company that we can't

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,450
really just throw into a field and hope

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,190
the templates will take care of it we

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,440
actually need to be able to weave it in

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,079
through the structure of a narrative

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,850
piece of text the way like a writer or

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,650
journalist would sit down and write and

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,850
the tools that we've got make that

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:13,910
really hard to replicate I mean we can

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:17,449
do it it's HTML it's computers they can

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,610
do anything if we try hard enough but it

00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:21,589
really bypassed a lot of the tools we

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,020
built to make things smooth and

00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,699
efficient and reproducible so the New

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,900
York Times made this but I think it was

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,980
something along the lines of a quarter

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,810
of a million dollars they ended up

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,040
spending building out this article and

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,949
the tech stuff that they ended up doing

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,860
and you know the visualizations so it

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:38,870
was a huge like moonshot exercise to do

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,470
this without all of the pre-existing

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,970
supporting tools and then when I started

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,920
looking around I started seeing this

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,630
kind of stuff everywhere was one of

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,270
those you know once you notice the thing

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,029
you can't stop seeing it everywhere you

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,949
go I saw other articles this is from the

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,860
verge it's a review of the Apple watch

00:11:54,949 --> 00:12:00,709
that just came out and it's just thick

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,709
with like background images washing

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:06,320
behind paragraphs little interstitial

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,630
you know graphics of how the watch is

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,550
assembled you know the little dots give

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,070
you progress indicators as you scroll

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,199
down through the article and this isn't

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,690
actually how every article on their site

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,250
looks heavily customized this because it

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,520
was a high profile piece that they

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,070
wanted to really promote this is um I

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,899
think polygon coms review of the Xbox

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,240
they have little SVG's that like

00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,810
animated like how the case opens as you

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,270
scroll through this is a piece from CNBC

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,190
it's not quite as obvious it's not quite

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,470
as flashy but like that little picture

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,260
of the Pope sitting there is actually a

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,449
relatively complex little bundle of HTML

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,370
there it's got captions it's got links

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,320
it's got photo credits it's got the

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,000
actual photo behind-the-scenes it's

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
actually got a link off to another

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,560
article about the Pope that's there and

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,709
it actually needed to live at a

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,320
particular spot in that article it

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,209
couldn't just be a related article that

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,760
we slammed in after the second paragraph

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:06,680
on every page or something and we find

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,689
this a lot with media clients like if

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,089
you're say writing a big article about a

00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:12,829
speech and you've got a video clip of it

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,810
you don't just want that slammed at the

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,040
top of the article you may want it in

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,980
the middle when you're actually talking

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,160
about the content

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,529
that particular speech this is another

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,389
news client that we've been working with

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,829
occasionally it's you know you've got

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,600
actually a fair number of little

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,370
structural elements in here we can all

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
work with Drupal think about how we

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,060
would break this down into fields and

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,500
stuff like that but the important thing

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,139
to note is that these little pull quotes

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,180
with the attributions and the sourcing

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,980
and stuff like that are actually at

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,199
important meaningful places throughout

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,480
the text they're not just associated

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,399
metadata for the article they're part of

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,740
the flow and they need to be treated

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,990
like that so I started to see this

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,209
everywhere all the clients that we

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,670
started talking two had some sort of

00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,440
need for this kind of stuff it was part

00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,880
of like an ongoing series of increasing

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,709
pressures that more and more content

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,930
publishers are facing they need greater

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,810
flexibility so that they could do cool

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,160
and interesting things they needed to be

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,360
able to reuse their content more

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,269
efficiently pushing it to other

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,769
platforms putting it on mobile apps you

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,449
know being able to adapt it to

00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,279
responsive design as they rolled out

00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:19,110
those kinds of projects they needed to

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,870
be able to produce it faster with less

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,120
effort and in a lot of newsrooms you

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,980
know the need to create more and more

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,829
interesting compelling content was not

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,260
coming with some some new wave of extra

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:32,430
hands to help produce this stuff they

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,410
actually had to figure out how to make

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,600
it do with tighter budgets and fewer

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,880
people in the newsroom and then there

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,130
was more and more competition in the

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,110
world of you know people building these

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,510
interesting and cool you know grand

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,829
websites there was more competition to

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,810
make their narratives rich and

00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:51,329
interesting an attention-grabbing it was

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,980
all really tough so after looking at a

00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:55,170
bunch of this stuff I started fine I

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,149
started thinking about it and identified

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,850
a couple of really key characteristics

00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,100
the things that were common factors that

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,860
made this particular really tough

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,620
problem what it was the first part is

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,660
long narrative text something that

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,180
actually needs to be read from start to

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,730
finish and has a flow to it not just

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,350
disconnected little chunks of text we

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,149
have a lot of really cool tools that if

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,920
what you're assembling is like a bunch

00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,050
of different statements about a product

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,699
and a call to action in the photo you

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,319
can assemble those really easily and

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,819
really quickly with different things we

00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:29,130
have in the Drupal world but if there's

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:30,570
long narrative text we say oh well

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,670
that's the body field

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,680
and then we get back into that danger

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,140
zone then we've got the problem of

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,900
islands of structure things like photo

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,370
galleries or step-by-step instructions

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,100
that don't necessarily just fit into a

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,930
simple you know unordered list or data

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,610
visualizations that you want to embed

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,560
that require more than just like an

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,340
image or something like that it's like

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,500
little pockets of complex structure that

00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,930
need to live in there and then the final

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,360
one the real sticking point placement

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,370
that actually matters like the classic

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,160
one is footnotes it's usually simple

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,750
textual content but you can't just have

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,210
a footnote sitting at the end of a

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,160
chapter it has to be meaningfully linked

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,290
to the space where to the place where

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,230
it's referenced that connection has to

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,060
live there in any combination of like

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,500
one or two of these things is pretty

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,660
easy to solve what the tools that we

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,180
have but whenever all three of them are

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,290
there simultaneously it got super

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,410
painful this is actually a screenshot of

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,870
an article about Flipboard that address

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,060
mentioned in his talk they do a lot of

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,190
stuff with super smart templates they

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,260
have templates that like adapt to

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,570
various layouts and stuff like that it

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,790
pulls in RSS feeds parses what's inside

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,530
of them comes up with cool and

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,800
interesting layouts but the problem is

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,770
is it's not a like templates like this

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,440
aren't able to respond to what's inside

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,720
of the content it's still a body filled

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,830
with photos you can maybe pull those out

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,710
it can come up with an interesting

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,170
layout but even in the Drupal world with

00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,699
all the PHP we throw at it this kind of

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,880
stuff isn't something we can really

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:12,209
solve just by telling the themer here go

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,740
do something crazy and more fields and

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,170
entities trying to break down our

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,860
content into smaller and smaller chunks

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,959
is also not quite a good solution the

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,750
paragraphs module is actually one that I

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,020
really like for those kinds of assembled

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,570
aggregate pages where you've got say a

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,580
blurb of text and then a listing of some

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,010
stuff and then a photo and then another

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,050
blurb of text but the problem is is if

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,770
you're treating an heir a long narrative

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,760
chunk of text like an article or say a

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,250
novella in that

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,490
or it becomes really really difficult to

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,470
actually edit it like narrative text

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,330
you've chopped it up into a bunch of

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,950
different fields what happens if you

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,620
want to take that image and move it up

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,740
to another paragraph well you've already

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,200
chopped half of it into one field an

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,030
image in this field and it ends up

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,590
becoming a really difficult way of

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,130
editing things that disrupts that

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,110
narrative flow and another thing that

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,490
you know I think all of us in the Drupal

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,860
community have lobbied for is the idea

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,710
of cleaner more semantic markup the idea

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,950
that if we just get people to use less

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:24,730
crappy HTML if we can get them to stick

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,090
to a magical subset of tags or maybe use

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,000
markdown that will just solve everything

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,500
then we can just have like CSS and some

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,750
lightweight JavaScript it just magically

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,210
on the front end solves this well the

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:42,940
problem is this is about as semantic and

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,220
clean as I could get a photo gallery to

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,900
be all of the actual heavy lifting of

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,420
how it should look cool how it should be

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,860
presented that's somebody's problem to

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,510
solve with javascript in class gating

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,720
style sheets but this is the structure

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,450
of a photo gallery that I say want to

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,110
place in my news story in a particular

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,000
position now the interesting thing is as

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,370
simple and streamlined doesn't semantic

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,070
as it is it still imposes a lot of

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,570
things that are inspired by the design

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,970
that's currently there on my

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,680
hypothetical website the fact that three

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,690
of the photos from this gallery are

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,270
listed there the fact that each one of

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,000
them links to a particular photo not to

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,890
the gallery itself the fact that there's

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,070
a particular tag line that goes to a

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:29,410
particular URL the fact that there isn't

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,540
any particular you know other text

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,130
underneath the tag line there's no title

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,870
there's no attribution these are all

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,180
important design decisions that may be

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,460
perfectly valid at the moment that that

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,980
chunk of HTML is dropped into the body

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,200
field but six months from now when

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,490
somebody says oh hey you know what we

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,370
actually want to put an interstitial

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:51,910
image in the fourth slot in each one of

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:55,309
our slideshows well if we've relied on

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,990
pure semantic HTML to solve this problem

00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:58,100
we're back at square one we've got to go

00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,929
through and we've got to pick through

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,960
all of our HTML and try to fix it and

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:05,480
it's terrible and this is actually one

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,830
of the reasons that increasingly more

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,600
and more powerful and more and more

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,519
streamlined WYSIWYG editors aren't

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,440
necessarily the problem if we give

00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,899
people a button for every different HTML

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,370
tag and we take out buttons for

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:19,419
everything we don't want them to put in

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:23,690
there they're still using those elements

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:26,749
to spell out a large structure in HTML

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,570
that really just represents the idea of

00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:32,119
I want that gallery to go there they're

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,980
still doing the work of a front-end

00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,289
developer basically right there in the

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,200
body field and that's dangerous the

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,119
problem is a vocabulary mismatch between

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,389
what we're giving people and what we

00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,419
actually are asking them to do in the

00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:48,950
text that they create html5 is great

00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:52,039
it's given us a lot of new semantic

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,679
tools things like asides instead of just

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,899
a div with a class of sidebar we've got

00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,869
sections unordered lists paragraphs

00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:01,820
citations emphasis you know nobody uses

00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,820
the I tag anymore we all know that we

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,740
shouldn't do that but in content the

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,649
actual stuff that editors are working

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,139
with are things like teasers or chapters

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,570
or related stories instead of just an

00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:17,869
unordered list they are thinking about

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,999
author bios or photo credits or the fact

00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:22,820
that something is promoted not just

00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:25,249
emphasized these are all the the

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,570
language that the people working with

00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:29,179
the content and even the people

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,070
designing the content are using as they

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,610
try to work with it but we're giving

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,950
them like this different set of tools

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,570
doesn't matter how smooth and convenient

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,119
and attractive it is it doesn't matter

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,600
how much we hide actual markup codes

00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,039
from them we're giving them like

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,869
flashcards for the wrong language and

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,580
asking them to make the best of it and

00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:51,559
that's where a lot of these long-term

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,389
maintenance problems end up coming out

00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,830
of no matter how rigorous we've been

00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:58,220
about trying to make everything quote

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,480
semantic so there is actually a solution

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,460
this is the good news I've been sort of

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,590
building up to you know the the

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:07,200
existential horror of all of this

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:10,620
terrible stuff living in body fields

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,330
the really important first step and this

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,510
ties in with that idea of the vocabulary

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,919
mismatch between HTML and what people

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,190
are really talking about when they talk

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,990
about the content we already do this in

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,299
the Drupal world and like in the content

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,039
strategy world when we start planning

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,200
out our content we're very used to

00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,659
looking through and picking out the the

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,389
essential little bits of atomic content

00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,940
that live on a site or in a project

00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:40,730
things like oh well there are chapters

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,559
or prizes or stock quotes or sessions or

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,149
blog posts or something like that we're

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,549
used to thinking of those you know

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,260
content type boundaries and we're even

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:51,299
used to thinking of teasing out like

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,750
what the individual fields in those

00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,700
content types are but what we need to

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,309
start doing is thinking not just of

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,659
content types and fields but what the

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:06,720
actual vocabulary of the content is for

00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,690
example if there are always next steps

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,720
and calls to action laced throughout the

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:16,230
text of the stove you know news stories

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,539
well that's an important structural

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,940
element even if it doesn't become a

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,559
Drupal field it may have design

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,510
treatments that go with it there may be

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,000
certain ways that editors always

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,279
approach that and always input it even

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,159
if it's very lightweight that's

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,350
something to hold on to because the

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,610
developers need to know about that the

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,429
designers need to figure out how to

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,320
treat those things and how to you know

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,600
build design components around those

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,580
things and the editors if they're

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,350
thinking oh well i'm going to write up

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,179
you know an announcement or something

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,740
like that even if it's all going into

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,450
the body field even if we don't have

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:56,519
structural elements to support it

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:58,409
they're thinking about those pieces so

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,510
that vocabulary that we provide people

00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,760
is the first starting point that's not

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,919
something that any individual team the

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,350
dev team can't go out and figure that

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,690
out the designers can't just go off and

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,340
whiteboard and wire frame that into

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,960
existence that's something that requires

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,070
everyone to get on the same page and

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,500
talk it through the next step to that

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,240
is starting to look through the stuff

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,370
that people are being asked to enter

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,490
into that body field and locate and

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,230
eliminate the boilerplate HTML like that

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,990
gallery example we were looking at

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,840
technically the only things that we're

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,370
really actually in there that captured

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,159
the fact that this was a particular

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:41,370
gallery at this particular place in the

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,409
article was the ID of the gallery and

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,880
that special tag line that they happen

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:48,480
to have entered in when they put it in

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,120
there now did anybody who's ever had to

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,990
work with an xml-based system don't

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,179
freak out well we'll talk this through

00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:03,210
what if and I know this is crazy talk

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:07,169
what if we took this and just put this

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:10,639
in there what if we just said gallery

00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:13,919
one should go here with this tag line

00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:19,409
just get it yeah okay okay you sir I'm

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:22,980
with you do I get an amen thank you just

00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:24,720
stick with me here so that the key idea

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,360
here I'm not talking about like you know

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,610
crazy XML business nobody needs to think

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:35,149
about data is taking all of this stuff

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,230
that is really just the design

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,179
manifestation of the idea of what a

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,049
gallery currently looks like on the site

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,909
and just store the fact that gallery one

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,950
with this particular tagline is what

00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:50,460
somebody entered that's our starting

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,960
point the next one is when positioning

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,059
matters we were talking about those

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,830
those structural elements that need to

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,450
be placed at important meaningful

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:01,259
locations throughout a long piece of

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,970
text well the same kind of stuff that

00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,399
we're talking about reducing the

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,279
complexity of markup structures can also

00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:11,850
be used conveniently enough to capture

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:15,840
that something ought to go here in the

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,490
text that same gallery tag can be laced

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,460
it you know random point through the

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,830
body field and be used to say import a

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,320
gallery node from somewhere else on the

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,179
site and slap it in there or say you've

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,309
just attached a bunch of photos to this

00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,910
particular node it's now carrying those

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:31,320
around

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,740
but you want them to live right there

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,860
you can use tags inside of the body

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,590
field to say that stuff should go right

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,810
here you're no longer putting piles of

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,510
weird structural markup that have all

00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,640
kinds of design dependencies and complex

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,320
structures that editors or content

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,390
authors need to memorize and figure out

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,120
how to enter properly just have these

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,550
simple relatively short tags that

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,370
conveniently enough it's also very

00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,290
simple to create WYSIWYG editor plugins

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,780
that can insert and manipulate those

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,090
kinds of things as opposed to trying to

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,010
parse the full structure of a photo

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,160
gallery and manipulated accurately

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,140
inside of the body field the actual

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,600
details of what you use for those kinds

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,660
of placeholders is way less important

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,580
than the fact that they're just storing

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,800
the essential information and that they

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,890
live in the body field itself like this

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,770
is more of an XML custom tag thing this

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,510
is an html5 give just with an extra data

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,060
attribute on it this is just like a

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,710
Drupal token all of those things there

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,270
are tools in our ecosystem to make those

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,610
things work once you have that

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,710
vocabulary and you know how you want to

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,380
put these things in there and the final

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,780
step that's really important is

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,150
accepting that there's always a

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:50,580
transformative step when content that

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,040
just stores the essential meaning and

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,560
structure of what you care about and

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,260
what the author is capturing when that

00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:02,220
goes out to another forum like you know

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,900
your web page or a mobile app or an RSS

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,870
feed there's always going to be a

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,350
transformational step going from your

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:13,290
content vocabulary to the language of a

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,810
web browser this takes a little getting

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,160
used to sometimes because especially in

00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,110
the Drupal world we've gotten used to

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,140
the idea of like input filters and

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:25,020
content filters just taking stuff and

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,120
like scrubbing out bad things the idea

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,280
is that you know the real markup that we

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,260
want to show it's still being stored in

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,660
there it's just being tidied up a little

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,370
bit occasionally will enhance that but

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,100
even though we've got this fabulous

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:40,140
input filtering mechanism running in

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,030
Drupal and we can do all sorts of

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,950
interesting transformational stuff to

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,750
what's been entered into the

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,840
body filled before it goes out to the

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,330
public we've never really as a community

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,950
accepted that there's just always going

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:55,399
to be a step where the stuff that people

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:58,190
get entered gets transformed into what

00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,320
ends up being displayed an example like

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,630
this little gallery ID one with a

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,250
particular tagline all kinds of

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,830
interesting stuff can be done with that

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,929
when it actually comes time to put it

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,539
out to the public on the mobile web you

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:13,399
could say hey are our basic like

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,679
baseline mobile first website is just

00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,659
going to show the title and a link to

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,370
the photo gallery will transform that

00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:21,950
before it even gets into the browser on

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,539
an enhanced website we may end up

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,549
turning that into like a complete

00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:27,440
scrolling gallery using client-side

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,480
scripting that loads after the page is

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,309
already knows already in when it goes

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,519
out to an email on say like a mailchimp

00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:36,200
link we may include one static image and

00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,049
a caption and then a link off to the

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,149
rest of the site partner api's that need

00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,070
to consume our content we'll just strip

00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:45,500
out all that rich stuff entirely and

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,139
give them pure text feeds the idea is

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,299
that once you've stored just that actual

00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:52,370
meaning you're no longer like trying to

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:55,490
write all of the smarts of a web browser

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,919
to reverse-engineer what crazy weirdness

00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,169
happens to have gone into that article

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,260
from 2004 and turned it into something

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:05,330
meaningful today you're just taking the

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,100
bit that says this is what's here and

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:11,059
turning it into what you want it to be

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,799
on the output that's a big step and the

00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,799
nice thing about this is that although

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,840
it's a mental leap it's a mental shift

00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:21,230
to start thinking about planning and

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,559
designing and architecting a Drupal site

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:26,720
this way it's not rocket science on the

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,909
technical front we have lots of the

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,820
individual tools that do each one of

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:33,740
these things but each sort of piece in

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,659
this puzzle ends up mattering when

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,690
you're in one of those big rich

00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:40,220
long-form narrative text scenarios where

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,490
you can't just sort of fake your way

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,289
around the fact that we're detailed

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,380
structural stuff needs to live at

00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:51,649
various places I see a couple of people

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,200
that are thinking I don't know I'm not

00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,549
sure I think I'm being tricked into

00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,409
using XML

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:03,320
all somehow that's okay the thing is is

00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:06,169
this is not actually a crazy pants idea

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,220
it's actually in use on a lot of sites

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:12,769
on either a large scale or in small ways

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:15,230
this is a screenshot from Haslett it's a

00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:18,409
Canadian literary magazine that we've

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,940
talked to I mean it's not as media rich

00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,679
in this example of some of the other

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,169
things we've looked at but things like

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,419
certain portions of the text being pull

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:29,989
quotes certain portions of the text

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,269
being called out in in like footnotes

00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:34,070
that float in the sidebar next to where

00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,409
the you know where the footnote notation

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:40,970
is all of those things are technically

00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:43,609
possible to do with pure HTML but when

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,769
they started saying hey instead of a

00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:47,749
bunch of spans and classes that our

00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,999
editors are asked to sort of go in there

00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:53,239
and add manually how about we just like

00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:55,429
have a footnote button and support that

00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:57,409
it really dramatically simplified things

00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:58,820
and they can transform that in different

00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:01,220
ways like the printer friendly version

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,230
can actually form at things differently

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,149
very easily this is one of the very very

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,470
lightweight examples we're easing into

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:10,999
it don't worry there's going to be

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:14,899
crazypants XML shortly this is another

00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:16,220
interesting example from the BBC over

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,440
the past couple of years they've been

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,830
moving to a complete like responsive

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,730
stack for all the different websites and

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,470
one of the things that they've been

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,559
doing is looking at the patterns that

00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:30,200
emerge as their journalists write and

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,509
produce stories things like what

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,489
requests are journalists putting in for

00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,039
support assets from their design

00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:39,139
department what things keep coming in

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,399
and people keep wanting to use this is

00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:44,600
an example of something they ended up

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,570
calling the data pick data pick it's

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,419
basically a combination of a photo a

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,399
title some number of different

00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:54,889
statistics it's all you know like

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,409
percentage or a number or whatever and

00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:59,179
an attribution at the bottom where this

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:02,899
source where this information was

00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:05,749
sourced from now structurally it ends up

00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:07,630
being like a bunch of nested gives some

00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:10,180
CSS classes you know

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,240
ordered lists all of the little bits of

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:16,450
markup that are necessary to make that

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,730
consistent and reproducible but as far

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,900
as an editor or a writer or a journalist

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,510
is concerned that's the title the image

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,820
the stats and the attribution and they

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,400
standardized on this and actually made

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,530
it a reproducible structural component

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,690
now what they've done is they've made a

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,820
little builder BBC journalists can go to

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,800
their data pic generator enter in all

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,140
those things and it spits out the stuff

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,500
that they can just paste in there now I

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,030
would personally say perhaps they should

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,350
put some markup in there that strips

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,120
that down to just what it needs to be

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,970
and transform on the output but you know

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,660
baby steps the idea is they're

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:58,840
identifying what the vocabulary of their

00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,670
particular site is the data pick this

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,200
particular way of capturing and

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,740
presenting little bits of information is

00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,080
at this point distinctively uniquely BBC

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,550
this is how their journalists capture

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,409
and communicate certain things and

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,899
identifying it and turning it into a

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,940
normal part of their shared vocabulary

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,620
so their devs their journalists their

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,810
writers even their business stakeholders

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,190
could all understand oh yeah we're

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,419
making a day to pick to drop in there

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,730
it'll take about this amount of time

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:27,040
they'll need these supporting tools that

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,960
gave them a bridge that they could

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,940
coordinate around and actually make

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,889
support tools that made something rich

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,659
and compelling a lot more a lot easier

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,310
for them to produce they could

00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,310
standardize around it and support it

00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:47,740
this is an example of bravo TV the

00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:50,830
reality TV station under the hood on the

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,590
Bravo TV blog they litter their posts

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,750
with lots of little bits interstitial e

00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,480
interspersed throughout their posts

00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,340
could be dramatic pull quotes from a

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,520
fight on the Real Housewives of

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,770
Hollywood it could be tweets from some

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,160
one on one of their shows that caused a

00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,230
buzz things like that um most of those

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,780
things have embed codes that they could

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,240
just drop in there but that's horrible

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:20,290
and no one likes embed codes

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,910
their hellish and nightmarish so there's

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,790
actually a drupal module I think called

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,670
entity token embed or token entity in

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,590
bed it's those three words in some

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:32,170
combination I've got it in a later slide

00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,900
but that's being used to just drop in

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,720
little tokens using the WYSIWYG editor

00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,640
when they click it comes up and they can

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,070
choose what of those different like

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,230
seven things that they always want to

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,970
embed and reuse throughout this you know

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,010
throughout their posts are they can

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,720
choose one if there's you know it does a

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,300
little Ajax II thing in the pop-up

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,910
window and says I want related posts how

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,310
many or I want to tweet here's the URL

00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,980
of the tweet or something like that it

00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:02,410
puts a token in there it's not even

00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,790
fancy from a WYSIWYG perspective it

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,680
doesn't give you a preview or anything

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,180
like that but it gives them exactly what

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,400
they need and it means they're not

00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,710
dealing with piles of weird cruft every

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,869
time they need to do that and it means

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,820
that they can selectively transform

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,430
those things in different ways whenever

00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,520
they output to different types of sites

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,859
different types of themes all kinds of

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,119
destinations this is the news site that

00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:29,080
I mentioned before that had the

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,050
surprisingly like rich content woven

00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,000
throughout their news stories they're

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,390
actually doing a lot of really cool and

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,109
interesting things with this behind the

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:43,780
scenes they actually have an editor the

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,060
store is pure like structural markup

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,570
they've broken up all of their images

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,530
and information about companies and

00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,900
personalities in the news and stuff like

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,910
that into supporting drupal assets so

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,560
they've got this rich asset library that

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,700
leverages things like entities and

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,190
fields and stuff like that in Drupal but

00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,090
they use custom tags throughout all of

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:10,330
the text to embed a reference to say

00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:13,119
Steve Jobs autobiography or a reference

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:16,090
to the current stock price of this

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,220
particular public company or an embedded

00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:21,160
version of this particular video clip

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:25,720
from their TV show in the flow of the

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,670
text and behind the scenes they're not

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,080
even storing HTML what they're actually

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,230
storing is a

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:36,010
system I think 20 tag xml schema that

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:39,070
they developed that is a literal xml

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:41,800
expression of their native vocabulary

00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,410
for their content I apologize the the

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,420
lighting is such that the actual markup

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,430
kind of vanishes and it just looks like

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,390
a very oddly spaced version of me

00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:56,590
talking about myself but I swear to you

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:59,680
there is actual mark up there but the

00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,990
idea is they have tags like pull quote

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,210
pull quote quote pro quo attribution

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,460
pull quote title goes way beyond just

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,620
like the existing vocabulary that HTML

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,100
provides they've got things like I want

00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,740
an asset to go right here or I want an

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,930
inline reference to a company to go here

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,080
and in their WYSIWYG editor they've

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:23,920
given editors just the buttons to enter

00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:27,010
in those native elements the editor that

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,680
they have isn't a list of HTML tags is

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,320
the list of the things that they put

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,870
into their stories whether it's simple

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,970
tags like the emphasis tag or complex

00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,880
ones like I would like a full media

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,560
asset to go here they just use those

00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,750
things and they're always using their

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,060
own vocabulary and then they can

00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,590
transform that on output into a bunch of

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,240
different formats they have third-party

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,180
partners that look at you know

00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,580
stripped-down pure text feeds they turn

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,620
it into you know responsive HTML on the

00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,510
front end they have apps that consume it

00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,460
and it's worked really really well for

00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,990
them for a long time it took a little

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,560
getting used to for people who thought

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:08,440
on doing HTML but it really really

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,440
worked smoothly and this theme of

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,740
finding the native vocabulary of your

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,950
content what those nouns are that your

00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:20,140
authors are working with that's a really

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,360
really important theme here and it's not

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,740
always super obvious it's not something

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,710
that you can necessarily see just from

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,330
looking at like the page and what what

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,430
pieces are there I think one of the

00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,810
examples I've always loved was two of

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,970
the clients that we worked with with

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,850
NBCUniversal were Bravo television and

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:40,570
oxygen TV they turned both those two

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,050
sites into a multi-site instance in 22

00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,970
instant

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,920
of drupal running on the same multi-site

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,750
they have the same codebase different

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,910
themes but like the same content types

00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,950
they're both reality television networks

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,720
they're both owned by the same company

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,130
they have you know obviously different

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,600
shows and different personalities and

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,880
stuff like that but man on paper that's

00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,130
just like that's an easy win to you know

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,450
two channels same stuff but the

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,800
interesting thing was under the surface

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,900
they discovered that there were actually

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,700
some very significant differences in how

00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,430
they thought about and communicated

00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,020
about their content on Bravo a lot of

00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,390
the in points of engagement that he

00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:16,330
talked a lot about were seasons and

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,700
competitions and the structural elements

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:23,020
of their content emphasized like the

00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:26,560
season of say Top Chef and what was

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,210
going on over that arc on Bravo TV it

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,250
was very personality-driven where a

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,440
particular person might appear on three

00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,650
or four shows and what someone arrives

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,200
there for is I want to see cell and so

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,200
on all of the shows they're on you know

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,110
this week I Love New York by golly and I

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,570
want to see everything she's been on

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:49,180
that didn't necessarily change their

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,700
model in a Drupal from a Drupal

00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,190
standpoint but it meant that they had to

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,440
think about what native elements their

00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:59,470
editors and there you know media people

00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,930
were talking about and using commonly

00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,430
and the design treatments had to take

00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,930
and take those kinds of things into

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,400
account that's the kind of subtle

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,410
distinctions that I think about when I

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,110
say the native vocabulary the difference

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,170
between a personality focus and say an

00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,730
event or a contest focus can be really

00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,280
meaningful when you start thinking about

00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,230
what affordances do we give the editors

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,090
who are working with this stuff what

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,030
design treatments do we want to focus on

00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:27,040
so that you know we can we can really

00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,670
smooth the process of working with them

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,220
this is a little bit deeply nerdy even

00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,600
nerdier than we've been so far but

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,150
there's a great book called domain

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,090
driven design if anybody feels the need

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:43,030
to like wait into a code book if you

00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:45,130
don't I'll give you the short pitch it

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,670
emphasizes the idea of developing what

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,950
it calls a ubiquitous language Oh in for

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:53,440
an organization or even an individual

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,280
product in which you you figure out like

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,990
what

00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,180
the core element of the domain you're

00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:00,760
working in is what are the one of the

00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,920
important pieces of this business or the

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,220
elements of this message that you're

00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:09,340
communicating out and getting developers

00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,690
the business stakeholders the designers

00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,980
who are figuring out how to present it

00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,650
and the content authors who are actually

00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,870
producing it on the same page using that

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,610
shared vocabulary so that they're not

00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:21,940
just talking past each other with one

00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,050
person talking about say a module when

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,820
they're thinking about a design

00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,650
component and the developer saying what

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,480
we've got a bunch of modules why do you

00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,950
want to add a new one we've had that

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,500
happen a couple of times does anybody

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,180
ever had the module confusion during the

00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,450
meeting with designers okay thank you we

00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,160
at least a couple of hands this this

00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:42,910
makes a really big difference that idea

00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,680
of building the shared vocabulary that's

00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:47,110
something that can even endure beyond a

00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,170
given project or a site built out and it

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:53,200
allows all of those different roles to

00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,050
communicate meaningfully as content is

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,420
developed as new features are added and

00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,610
in the case of something like the BBC

00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,220
data pics project when you start

00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:06,760
noticing new patterns emerging it's not

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:09,400
just a particular bunch of markup that

00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,620
keeps getting jammed in there it's a new

00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,650
noun suddenly appearing in our

00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:18,160
vocabulary we're using this new element

00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:23,080
in what we communicate and perhaps we

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:26,260
can build on that this is where I really

00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,460
go off the rails um one of the things

00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,430
that I think is really interesting is

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,930
that in in linguistics a lot of the

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,560
things that we start talking about like

00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,060
how editors can interact with rich

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,120
arbitrarily structured content using

00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:42,370
these tools they're they're also the

00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,550
common factors that distinguish human

00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,920
language from just animal noises like

00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,710
one of the qualities that makes human

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,110
language distinct as duality the idea

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,570
that small individual pieces like

00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,790
phonemes and sounds that we use to

00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,860
construct words are actually distinct

00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:02,470
things in and of themselves but we

00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,600
assemble them together into words and

00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,940
phrases and sentences in order to

00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,520
communicate complex ideas those little

00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,350
Tom

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,090
make pieces you might call them say

00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:17,570
components those get assembled into

00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,860
important parts of a whole the other the

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,020
other quality that makes human language

00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,060
unique is creativity the idea that it's

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,790
not just a set list of sounds that

00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,650
correspond to particular emotions or

00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,320
dangers or foods or something like that

00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,090
that we can take those little components

00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,150
then we can assemble them new and

00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:39,740
interesting in novel ways like I could

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:44,870
take photo galleries and maps and tweets

00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:47,570
and raw text and say progress indicators

00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:50,480
if those are parts of my core vocabulary

00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:52,310
and let's say personalities like a

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,590
little bio and whatever goes along with

00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,600
that if those are the core elements of

00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,460
the vocabulary that I have in my content

00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,560
there's actually a lot of interesting

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,740
things that I can assemble out of those

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,140
in a fluid and creative fashion even if

00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,870
we never thought to make a special big

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,330
template for that type of content that

00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,920
allows for creativity and reuse of the

00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,720
small elements and the other one is

00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,850
things like the other qualities

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,070
patterning the idea that those elements

00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:23,140
aren't just arbitrary they get assembled

00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:25,520
according to certain rules like say an

00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,060
article can't consist of just a pile of

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,460
tweets it has to have other things in it

00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,770
validation rules you know design systems

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,270
that support and sort of undergird all

00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,700
this stuff that's being done are an

00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:40,550
important part of it I'll stop talking

00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,160
about linguistics now I swear that's all

00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:45,080
but I find it really interesting and

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,820
personally inspiring when we talked

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,670
about content that has to be compelling

00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,760
and communicate interesting and valuable

00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:54,320
messages that a lot of the challenges

00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,750
that we start facing here and a lot of

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,790
the solutions that we can find end up

00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,740
being very close to like the problems of

00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,570
like how linguistics and based the

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,670
basics of human communication work this

00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,400
it just makes me happy inside this is

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,920
the stuff that makes my day go around so

00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,510
making it happen we've got all the

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,300
highfalutin stuff we've got like are

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,370
like big grand vision for what human

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,130
communication and the body field all

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:21,470
mean but like day-to-day

00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,630
how does this actually become reality on

00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,240
a Drupal project or any web project

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,460
really a lot of the basic building

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,990
blocks the starting points of developing

00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,330
like the shared language in the shared

00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,980
vocabulary are already in use things

00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,410
like style guides and component

00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,840
libraries in a lot of organizations are

00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:41,540
starting to serve that purpose already I

00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,090
think it needs to go another step beyond

00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,880
that to include voices like the

00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:49,940
editorial team and how they how they

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,890
write not just how it's presented but

00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,470
the idea of these kinds of component

00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,970
libraries is an already a very valuable

00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:00,760
sort of touch point for this kind of

00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:03,770
stuff has anybody seen pattern lab I oh

00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,040
you know it's it's it's a very sort of

00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:09,380
opinionated tool for doing wireframing

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,350
from like tiny little atomic components

00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,100
and building up to page modules and page

00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:19,970
types and specific pages but the idea of

00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,220
using those sorts of reproducible atomic

00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:24,440
elements as parts of your design and

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,420
assembling them in interesting in Union

00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,460
in creative ways throughout the rest of

00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,010
the site is very similar to what we're

00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,720
talking about on a Content level a lot

00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,150
of the concepts and principles that are

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,160
there in pattern lab and then the atomic

00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:39,680
design concept are really really

00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,450
applicable to this if anybody's messed

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,000
around with a lot of like client-side

00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:47,420
hacking and like you know react you know

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,280
job in job the JavaScript world it does

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,780
very interesting things it's built

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,510
around the idea of you basically

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:56,960
defining your own little Dom elements to

00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:59,810
go inside of an HTML page and using

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,900
javascript components to define what

00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:06,980
gallery means and what it ought to do or

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:10,070
what navigation is in your markup you

00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:13,220
enter the gallery tag or the navigation

00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,780
tag or the call-to-action tag and then

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,240
you have a component that goes and

00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,910
handles that stuff like in the front end

00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,820
development world the toolbox to

00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:25,580
actually build out interesting and

00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,990
worthwhile representations of these you

00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,790
know core vocabularies that we're

00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,900
talking about it's already there and

00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,130
it's pretty

00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,380
weed in terms of like drupal build outs

00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,120
and the stuff that we can just click in

00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,280
and turn on all ready to make these

00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,110
things happen a lot of really powerful

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,050
tools we have are things like the node

00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:47,630
embed module the token insert entity

00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:49,430
module we saw that in the screenshot it

00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:51,170
lets you drop tokens that represent

00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,690
other entities on the Drupal site just

00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,150
inside of the body field there's also a

00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,950
module called entity in bed that's been

00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,990
developed for that's being developed for

00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,570
Drupal 8 and has been back ported to

00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,420
drupal 7 now that does a lot of really

00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:07,430
cool stuff it comes from like the same

00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,470
team that did the media module that it's

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,900
been expanded to include all different

00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:14,210
types of drupal entities and the ability

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,460
to say drop an entity into the body

00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,960
field and then choose what display mode

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:24,290
you want it to be rendered in when it

00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:27,020
goes there cool stuff if you've ever

00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,730
used wordpress shortcodes that's

00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,590
actually really common in the WordPress

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,410
world and it's another example of this

00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:36,500
kind of idea shortening big chunks of

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:38,180
boilerplate markup or weird embed codes

00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,760
and turning them into short little

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,100
representative you know bracketed tokens

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,140
that can be easily entered in there's

00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,840
also a short codes module for Drupal

00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,910
that is roughly an equivalent API to the

00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,430
word for a short codes module that's one

00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:55,070
that I think the I think the Bravo TV

00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,450
team used heavily on the project in

00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,850
order to get a lot of their different

00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,970
you know whacky embeds to work to work

00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:03,980
smoothly it's you know not everything

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,230
has to be XML not everything has to be

00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,450
developing some sort of like custom

00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,190
schema like that news site as long as

00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,810
you start with that vocabulary and

00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,540
you're looking at these things as tools

00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,330
to make that vocabulary happen and put

00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,530
it in the hands of the editors easily

00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,440
there's lots of different tools that can

00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:23,690
make it happen I mentioned the embedding

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,270
of nodes and entities inside of other

00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,160
things like just the concept that we

00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:31,010
have in the Drupal world of being able

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,470
to create different view modes for a

00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:35,570
particular type of content and say well

00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:39,200
I've got teaser mode or full mode or

00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:42,140
promo mode that I want to have for these

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,160
things those are those can be a part of

00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,560
this vocabulary

00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,110
to the idea that certain kinds of

00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,560
contact content appear in different

00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:54,260
forms in different places and we can use

00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,240
those to establish consistency as we're

00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,770
embedding them across various places and

00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,210
putting them into different context and

00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,680
we're using them and if you're just

00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,350
really crazy and you want to go all out

00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,920
it's totally possible especially in

00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:09,320
Drupal 8 with ckeditor built into core

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,810
to roll your own using custom editor

00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,910
plugins designing your own tags with

00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:16,010
html5 and using Drupal's output

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,710
filtering system to transform them into

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,050
whatever final mark up your design

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,240
requires as long as people have entered

00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,060
in the actual meaningful semantic

00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:30,080
underlying content this is actually a

00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:32,480
real tiny adore ck editor plugin that

00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,150
lets people entering crazy mathematical

00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,470
stuff i don't understand it but it's got

00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,710
lots of Greek in it so it looks

00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:44,390
impressive so how are we going to tie

00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:46,910
this up that shared vocabulary is really

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:49,280
the core building block of a lot of this

00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:52,010
the technical solutions have actually

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,680
been with us for decades like the XML

00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,390
community they solve this stuff like you

00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,100
know back when we were trying to figure

00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,620
out how we could actually keep people

00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:03,590
from pasting xss into everything you

00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:06,560
know they figured out interesting ways

00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:09,170
to treat these problems on the upside

00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,490
they still have to hire Java developers

00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:14,360
whenever they want to sort a list of

00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:16,520
posts so you know the sort of entities

00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,980
and fields and you know templates Mont

00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,410
model that we have it is super powerful

00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,660
but if we start combining these things

00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:25,880
and treating them both as tools that

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,250
allow us to bring this core vocabulary

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,260
for our content to fruition and put it

00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:33,800
in the hands of the editors it's really

00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,270
really really cool it's very powerful so

00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,910
we've got those three problems the

00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:40,490
narrative text the islands of structure

00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:42,320
that occur inside of it placement that

00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,900
actually matters and can't be ignored

00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,240
and that's really the crux of this

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,310
particular problem we've got the four

00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,960
steps to salvador defining the language

00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,810
of the content that shared vocabulary

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,200
that we can use across developers

00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,670
designers

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,609
content editors and even business

00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:03,000
stakeholders we can use fields entities

00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:05,070
Drupal content types and custom markup

00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,980
when it's called for to capture that

00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:10,950
content language and when we store

00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:14,339
content and manage it and give people

00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:16,980
tools we use that vocabulary not just

00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:19,829
buttons that mirror the vocabulary of

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,570
HTML on the browser and then we

00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,630
transform it for output into whatever

00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,520
form we need it's cool stuff and when

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,230
it's actually done when we actually are

00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,310
doing this stuff there's five core

00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:34,710
payoffs that consistently end up coming

00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,320
to fruition here more creative freedom

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:39,900
because once the tools are in place that

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,670
sort of creative expressive aspect of

00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,880
being able to combine these elements in

00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:48,180
New in different ways becomes a lot

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,670
easier so editorial freedom the I just

00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,140
want to put stuff in places I don't have

00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,640
to worry about all the you know getting

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,200
new templates designed and stuff like

00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,690
that that becomes a lot easier to

00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,630
achieve it actually becomes easier to

00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:03,030
transform and repurpose content because

00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,950
instead of big wads of HTML that just

00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,780
had to get pasted in to make the

00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,490
deadline we've actually got these

00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,970
meaningful bits that are easy to detect

00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:13,680
parse and transform into other forms the

00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,960
editing experience is a lot easier to

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,280
streamline because the stuff that we're

00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,530
talking about putting into the body

00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,280
field is actually really easy to write

00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:25,020
editing plugins to support there's less

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,640
one-off development because as the

00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,680
editors have more creative freedom with

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,230
the tools that they've got custom

00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,780
development is much less necessary to

00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:36,680
come in and handle edge cases for a

00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,589
particular kind of article the the

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:43,410
$250,000 like moonshot big media article

00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:45,540
isn't as necessary if the reproducible

00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:49,170
tools are there and also that ubiquitous

00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:51,329
language that shared vocabulary is all

00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,950
about improving communication between

00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:55,380
different groups and different teams

00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,930
that are very often siloed on our

00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,790
project and anything on our projects and

00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,470
anything that we can do to get those

00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,060
people talking to each other and

00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,819
collaborating with each other and

00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,380
sharing knowledge and and coming up with

00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:08,849
solutions without spending their time

00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,410
just arguing

00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:12,660
boardroom about whether the slider

00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:16,170
should be bigger or not i think is a big

00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,999
win so if you're looking for more

00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,759
interesting books and you don't mind

00:55:17,999 --> 00:55:22,619
diving into some nerdiness that a domain

00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:25,140
driven design is a good one for people

00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:27,150
from a programming background there's

00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,729
also a great book called designing news

00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,470
that's a couple of dozen case studies of

00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:33,359
how different news and publishing

00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,729
organizations have tackled the design

00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,920
challenges of publishing things at scale

00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:40,049
and on digital and then there's a book

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,470
by a be covert called how to make sense

00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:45,960
of any mess it's a great sort of guided

00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,880
tour of the core tools of information

00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,009
architecture and decomposing weird

00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,109
thorny problems like this when it comes

00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:53,970
times comes time to actually like

00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,950
negotiate that shared language with a

00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,989
room full of people who are used to

00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,609
speaking their own language her book has

00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:02,279
a lot of great tools to make that happen

00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:03,779
and if you're interested I'm going to be

00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:06,509
posting the slides and there's a whole

00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:09,299
mess of different articles and links and

00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:12,269
websites they have more explorations of

00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:14,219
this kind of stuff I think we do

00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:17,039
actually have in a shocking turn of

00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:20,279
events for my presentations a couple of

00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:24,559
minutes for questions I know this is

00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:24,559
unprecedented but thank you

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:41,540
hello okay thank you so I'd like to

00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:43,040
invite you for a detailed talk yes for

00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,200
those who don't know it data is the

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,110
Darwin information typing architecture

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,830
and they basically cured cancer a decade

00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:54,740
ago and no one noticed so so but because

00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:57,230
I'm here actually in la i'm staying with

00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:59,510
a with one of the members of the oasis

00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,690
theta committee that's working on

00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:04,850
lightweight dita oh and there they're

00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:08,470
looking for ways to do kind of a

00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:10,880
markdown html5 kind of way of doing data

00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,290
it's it's really really interesting and

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,500
right that sounds like a fascinating

00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:19,460
conversation we I would love to do that

00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:24,550
with you definitely okay yeah but oh and

00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:26,720
anybody else who's interested to join hi

00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:30,050
this does this actually work okay and

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,340
get really close um I I kind of have a

00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,520
feeling I know how you'll answer this

00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,620
but how do you get the content editors

00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,110
on board with this kind of new way of

00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,890
entering content if we've trained them

00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:44,990
on wysiwyg almonds like what we still

00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:46,730
use wysiwyg editors right but like

00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,110
there's tokens and stuff in that it

00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,430
doesn't show them the picture

00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,020
necessarily that they want to drop in

00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,400
there well I've we've spent a lot of

00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,720
times it didn't actually appear in any

00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,980
of these screenshots so the question for

00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,870
anybody didn't hear it was how do you

00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,490
get editors on board with like tokens

00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,400
going into the body field instead of

00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:03,950
actually a picture um with a number of

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,380
our clients we actually have written the

00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:09,050
ckeditor plugin that actually turns that

00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:12,650
into an image or even a placeholder in

00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:14,780
the in the editor so that's totally a

00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,610
possibility it's just the in the example

00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,260
that we had you know the editing team

00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,970
was already used to a wordpress site in

00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,500
which they inserted short codes so they

00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,030
were actually perfectly comfortable with

00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,550
that but that is one of the advantages

00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:29,300
of using this approach that it's very

00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:32,420
easy to layer a like editorial view of

00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:34,490
these things on top of it the client I

00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,950
was I think we were talking about their

00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,589
first iteration actually just showed the

00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,930
YouTube logo or the

00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:42,309
logo instead of the actual video because

00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,440
it let them turn it around in an

00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:47,469
afternoon but then in future iterations

00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:51,789
they made the like the in editor preview

00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:54,940
richer but it it was it was remarkably

00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:59,380
straight forward when you're talking

00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:02,339
about out putting this stuff in say an

00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,589
API type format how do you recommend

00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:07,420
rendering the the stuff in the middle do

00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:09,849
you do you recommend out putting it as

00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:12,640
HTML along with everything else or as a

00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:14,829
separate if general e it generally

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,410
depends on who's going to be consuming

00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:19,930
it and how I know a couple of our

00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:22,119
clients who've actually just kept XML

00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,339
style tags in there and in their

00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,890
documentation they say when you get our

00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:29,589
content there are these four tags that

00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,569
will represent placeholders for media

00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:33,700
attachments that you will get in other

00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,979
parts of the API payload and stuff like

00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,279
that I've also seen situations where it

00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:41,170
just gets stripped off and treated as

00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:43,239
just attached data and they consider

00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:46,239
that an acceptable loss for certain

00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:49,719
formats but not on their website it

00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:52,359
depends like to some extent the ability

00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,759
to decide how you're going to do that in

00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:59,890
different contexts is what you get out

00:59:54,759 --> 01:00:03,579
of this approach right thank you so I'm

00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:05,890
buying what you're selling as far as the

01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:09,609
just got a trench coat that I open up

01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:12,160
and there's a bunch of XML so that a you

01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:15,369
need to mark up the width as far as the

01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,579
tokens and when you're rendering content

01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:21,279
for that piece of atomic content right

01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:24,369
what about if you're also you want to

01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:27,069
build experiences elsewhere so you don't

01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:29,890
want to just display a gallery one on

01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:32,529
this article but maybe gallery one is

01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,989
used on 50 articles throughout the site

01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:38,710
and if you're giving up that entity

01:00:34,989 --> 01:00:41,229
reference potentially that's an

01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:44,380
excellent question so this is a subtle

01:00:41,229 --> 01:00:47,170
distinction like what if I'm writing an

01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:50,200
article and I want the Drupal II like

01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:51,650
entity reference meaningful connection

01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,960
between this article

01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:56,120
that gallery I want to be able to like

01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,280
write a views query that pulls that up

01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,900
but I want to be able to position it

01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,650
meaningfully that's actually something

01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,790
that on the Bravo site was done in

01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:07,250
technically when you're inserting those

01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:09,530
references on the Bravo site you're not

01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:11,840
just inserting arbitrary references to

01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:14,030
other entities you add those to an

01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,340
entity reference field and the WYSIWYG

01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:18,170
editor actually lets you pick from the

01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:21,440
things that you've associated with it in

01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:24,620
that context your node sort of becomes

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
like the giant crate that all of the

01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,850
stuff for this particular piece of

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,650
content needs and the body field has

01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:32,450
just what's necessary to assemble the

01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,650
stuff in that crate it doesn't

01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:37,360
necessarily have to bear the entire

01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:40,100
weight of all of the relational stuff I

01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,200
got a couple questions that I'm assuming

01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,960
this works for tiny MCE as well right um

01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,820
yeah well actually the one of our

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,920
clients was working on Drupal 7 they did

01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,680
need to do this in MC I don't like the

01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,630
tiny MCE like API as much but yeah you

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,460
know the basic capabilities are

01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,620
definitely there how do you deal with

01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,990
like developer not developers but

01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,840
designers that want to go on in manually

01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:05,510
edit that HTML you take away the ability

01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,130
to swap out from the WYSIWYG view well

01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:13,010
if what you're actually inserting isn't

01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:15,380
HTML but a meaningful tag that says the

01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:17,780
gallery goes here and the HTML for that

01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:20,020
gallery you know as an example actually

01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,120
lives in a different template section

01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:25,460
some of that is sort of overcome you you

01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,840
don't run into quite as much of the by

01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,580
golly no I just want to switch to the

01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,470
HTML and look if I just could just put a

01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,750
style attribute on this span than I

01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:36,710
could solve everything you know i mean

01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:39,530
if if what you've got is experienced

01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:41,510
HTML designers who just need to dump

01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:45,110
stuff in a body field because that's how

01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:49,040
you're deploying fully formed HTML and

01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:51,260
to some extent you know it's the purpose

01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:55,100
of this is to reduce the need for that

01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:57,740
as much as possible um some people like

01:02:55,100 --> 01:03:00,800
going at it old school so you kind of

01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:03,320
time down to the buttons hey yes to some

01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,240
extent and do a good selling job you do

01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,820
and and

01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,750
oftentimes if it's actually a front end

01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:12,430
designer who's doing that kind of stuff

01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,260
yeah you know they may be the person

01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,880
who's editing the templates anyways you

01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,470
know when stuff actually gets piped out

01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,600
but what we've often found is that

01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:22,540
editors who are tasked with that kind of

01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,660
stuff are actually pretty darn happy to

01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:28,750
relinquish manual tweaking of the code

01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:31,240
as long as they can accomplish what they

01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,950
need to accomplish in their jobs and

01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,840
that's where like bringing them into the

01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,340
conversations so this is not just

01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,960
handing off a bunch of buttons to them

01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:40,900
and saying knock yourselves out is a

01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,660
really important part of it okay last

01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,490
question Thanks thanks so much for this

01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:52,060
Jeff it's really great it's like you're

01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:55,390
inside my head I can we've had a good

01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:57,220
deal of success confronting these issues

01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,830
with something like paragraphs or in

01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:02,440
line any form or some variation on that

01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:04,660
theme and it seems to me like it sort of

01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,550
comes down to an interface decision

01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,440
whether to have them doing it in the

01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,390
WYSIWYG or doing it that way and I

01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,510
wondered if you might be able to speak a

01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:15,550
little bit more about what problems that

01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,930
you encountered trying to confront it

01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:18,250
with something like paragraphs the

01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,630
biggest challenge with something like

01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,400
paragraphs for people who haven't used

01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:23,710
the module it basically turns like the

01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,230
node editing form into like a stack of

01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:28,870
elements that you can add it's like a

01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:31,120
multi field form where you say I want a

01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:33,450
bunch of text you can enter text I would

01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:38,200
like a view underneath that I would like

01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:40,240
an image next to a call to action block

01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,820
you can assemble really interesting and

01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,360
rich stuff very very quickly using it

01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:48,970
the downside at least in my experience

01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:53,700
comes when you've got something like say

01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:57,130
a nine thousand word essay and it needs

01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:00,610
bits that live at special places in the

01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:02,620
middle theoretically you could chop that

01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,600
at the places where those media elements

01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:09,190
live turn each one of those into a

01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:10,930
different field full of HTML but that

01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:13,570
almost always ends up turning it into

01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:15,250
like a final stage you're almost like

01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:17,540
it's like when you know in the old days

01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,580
when we would hand-cut JPEGs

01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:21,530
to get them ready for the design it's

01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:26,800
sort of like that process but with our

01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:29,360
text if that's an acceptable process

01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,450
then there's nothing prevent you from

01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:34,640
doing that but it also means that if you

01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:37,910
say were to want to output a feed of

01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,860
just the text or change where certain

01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:41,570
things are presented now you're going to

01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,510
be going and parsing through basically a

01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:46,640
Drupal object model and trying to

01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:50,210
reassemble it differently it's it's

01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:52,790
specifically that flowing narrative text

01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:55,100
that has the elements inside of it we

01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:57,560
actually have seen the paragraphs style

01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:00,350
approach be really effective with like

01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,660
say marketing pages for a product where

01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:04,910
what you're assembling is a number of

01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:07,160
distinct statements that might build on

01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,450
each other and have supporting images or

01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:12,050
whatever but they aren't like that

01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:16,130
flowing text narrative does that make

01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:18,940
sense ok well thank you i will stop

01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,940
