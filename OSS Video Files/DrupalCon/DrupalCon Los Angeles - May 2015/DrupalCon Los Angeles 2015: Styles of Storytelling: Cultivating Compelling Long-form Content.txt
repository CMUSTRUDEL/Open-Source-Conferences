Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Many organizations are embracing storytelling techniques to better connect with their audiences and drive them to action. Theyâ€™re implementing long-form content as a platform for storytelling making use of its rich imagery, interactive elements, and better sharing capabilities.


People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.
