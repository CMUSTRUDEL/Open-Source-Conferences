Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Styles of Storytelling: Cultivating Compelling Long-form Content
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Many organizations are embracing storytelling techniques to better connect with their audiences and drive them to action. Theyâ€™re implementing long-form content as a platform for storytelling making use of its rich imagery, interactive elements, and better sharing capabilities.


People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.

a strategist user experience designer

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,859
project manager for the past four or

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:11,040
five years now and this is Courtney

00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:13,590
hello I'm Courtney Clark I'm a senior

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,809
user experience designer at forum one as

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,210
well and I've been doing this for about

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,600
a decade working mostly with nonprofits

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:27,210
government agencies foundations and the

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,990
like my glasses were pink though I love

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,520
that image so much so our title that

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,530
you've seen is a little bit full of

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,850
jargon and it's got buzzwords and we

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,829
find that kind of annoying quite

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,780
honestly so here are some other possible

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,430
titles let's how long form or dissecting

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,160
long-form because we're going to try to

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,059
do these during our presentation today

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,800
our primary ask of you today is that you

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,660
walk out of here and you are super

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,670
excited to do the following things you

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,239
want to a you want to give long form a

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,859
try you want to try arreted work that

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,780
into your content and finally we hope

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,489
you use our tips and our framework to

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,500
kind of get started thinking down that

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,970
process and courtney's going to get more

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,470
into that a little down the line so we

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,409
have reasons for you to do these things

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,270
as well so good it's not just to be a

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,030
cool kid it's also because you are a

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,740
publisher if if you have a website you

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,869
are a publisher the web is kind of

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,700
forced everybody into this this role and

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,009
if you have any type of content and if

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,210
it's longer than 2,000 words you're it

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,250
should live online you should be

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,290
thinking digitally first you should also

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,229
be thinking about the user experience of

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,720
that content the second we reason people

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,060
like good long stuff right and they like

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,180
to share it there's a joke in there

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,799
somewhere finally a long form is just

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,049
cool i said it's not just to be part of

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,340
the cool group it's super fun and it's

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,079
super exciting and it's kind of the

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,159
cutting edge of content so in terms of

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,759
design and and usability I think but

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,009
anyway so we've been racking our brains

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,479
to define long form in a concrete way

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,799
right to make sense of all these

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,840
different definitions floating around

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,940
because there is a lot floating around

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,760
so according if I talked about this for

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,670
like hours exhausted

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,959
too weird degree even and I feel like

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,610
we've made sense out of the several

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,290
types of long-form floating around out

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,900
there and that's what part of what we'd

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:28,530
like to talk to you about today so get

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:30,900
on the long-form train I'm sorry at a

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,230
high level long-form content means

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,140
content that is mostly static in that it

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,629
doesn't change hardly ever it's more

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,579
than 2,000 words and it's self-contained

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,370
meaning it probably would have existed

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,650
before the web in a very contained sort

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,390
of way right examples of documents like

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,220
this might is included or it might

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,950
include brochures like very long

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,190
brochures policy reports research

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:59,150
articles magazine articles etc and

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,099
you'll hear more examples in a minute

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,280
all right so long form gets thrown

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,139
around a lot as a term the term has its

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,790
roots in journalism right so for

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,470
instance we searched the the hashtag

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,019
long-form on Twitter and if you're using

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,970
it today you'll see a lot of examples

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,669
that look like these you know really

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,709
punchy big images that are super

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,090
exciting and it might have video in the

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,799
background and there might be music

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,650
playing and there's parallax and just

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,799
party everywhere a little bit like

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,699
snowfall if anybody familiar with that

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,709
because a while back the new york times

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,730
published this article snowfall was a

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,709
traditional long-form feature style like

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,230
news article but it was really highly

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,660
designed and it was jeez it was all the

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,549
rage and it was well written that's

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,829
really I think ultimately why it still

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,840
lives around but long-form isn't just

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,760
for journalists anymore right since the

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,650
web is ushered everybody again into

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,959
publishing long-form is now of interest

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,359
to well everybody including I think

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,220
everybody in this room and because I'm

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,900
increasingly frustrated with this phrase

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,879
long form that I keep saying over and

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,400
over again Courtney and I got all

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,129
reductionist so here's how we propose

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,780
long-form be broken down we reduced it

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,840
to three elements there's the look and

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,780
feel structures and copy so of course

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,120
how it feels how its organized and what

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,590
it says so let's dig into that a little

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,290
bit look and feel right in the flurries

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,940
of excitement around long-form content

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,100
this is almost always what's brought up

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,140
you hear about these really strong

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,640
reactions for like look at this

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,310
beautiful video like we just mentioned

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,870
snowfall I mean when that was released I

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,700
mean the nothing was really knew as far

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,620
as the coffee went but it was it was a

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,170
news feature right but it was so pretty

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,910
and so new so a lot of times when

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,770
long-form content is brought up in any

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,480
capacity especially in discussions

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,580
around web and content design it's these

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,140
elements that are probably at the center

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,030
of the discussion and there are

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,820
definitely clear trends and have touched

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,190
on a few of them already these this

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,880
tendency towards big full screen images

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,500
that are just so captivating parallax is

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,590
a big thing that keeps showing up

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,900
everywhere for good or bad I don't know

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,120
and some in some cases sounds I've seen

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,400
a few articles that play like features

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,850
of artists playing and playing music

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,550
that they perform loud colors and again

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,230
striking imagery but the focus to be

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,510
clear the purpose of long-form content

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:29,000
is not on these elements these elements

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,770
are meant to support the copy next up we

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,320
have structure or how that copy is

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,000
organized well there's likely a lot of

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,650
room for discussion and there's probably

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,960
some nuance here but we wanted to break

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,150
it down as simply as we could and so we

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,010
broke it down into these two kind of

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,920
opposite things you've got a linear

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,890
piece or you have a non-linear piece or

00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,760
what we're calling exploratory linear is

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,320
in a line yes I know that's very obvious

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,060
but I just want to make sure we get all

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,850
this all get on the same page in terms

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,390
of what we mean when we say linear so

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,680
linear content is meant to be read

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,990
stress that it's meant to be read point

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,430
A to point B there is a beginning there

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,800
is a physical and sync novels magazines

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,360
features articles blog posts etc it's

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,960
about as classic as it gets in terms of

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,640
published content to with linear content

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,490
is a reader's physical journey through

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,280
that piece is it's almost completely

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,280
predictable they are almost exclusively

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,990
reading from point A to point B which

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,790
makes brings me to my final point and

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,890
that that predictability allows us to

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,380
design very specific experiences around

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,070
that content because we know how they

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,790
are going to

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:44,510
you go through it now exploratory on the

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,130
other hand is nonlinear and expect

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,750
varying paths of progression through

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,220
this piece of content it's a lot more of

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,660
like what we think when we think about a

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,630
website you click through it to get

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:56,480
around it's not meant to be read from

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,190
start to finish for examples I'm trying

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,290
to think of a better examples but think

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,180
of like think of like a full magazine as

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,740
a piece of exploratory content you're

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,840
probably not reading from cover to

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,090
finish you're jumping around and finding

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,460
what you want or think of a coffee table

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,220
book an annual report cook book

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,590
encyclopedia user guides these documents

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,950
are experienced in a very different way

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,160
than say a snowfall like article or a

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:25,310
novel it's also a little bit harder to

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,680
get like use exploratory structures to

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,270
tell like full narrative experiences but

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,200
will won't get on to that in a second

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,190
too so all right we've talked about the

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,230
look and feel we've talked about

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,360
structure now this is the fun stuff

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,640
right let's talk about words so

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,770
traditionally long-form then again so

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,780
many more than so many words but we all

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,300
know that reading experiences are not

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,670
created equally some pieces are meant to

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,310
moralize to persuade in some way while

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,610
others serve to teach inform instruct

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,610
some have agendas others try so hard not

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,800
to have agendas journalism and again

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,540
some are legally required to not have an

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,660
agenda which is overlooked a lot of

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,940
times so we broke down web long form

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,070
into two categories reference and

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,030
narratives this could just as easily

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,620
have been not persuade and persuade or a

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,020
motion lap emotionally connect and

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,680
emotionally connect if the word persuade

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,090
or persuasion feels kind of dirty but

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,790
let's look at reference by definition

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,980
reference does not have an agenda and

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,030
yes this gets complicated

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,090
philosophically in terms of what can

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,440
have a bias and can you not have a bias

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,120
but just for the purpose in some tips

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,430
let's simplify it and say it does not

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,410
have an agenda Thank cookbooks data

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,590
briefs trying to report census reports

00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:45,050
portrayals of data this kind of content

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,730
is almost always meant to be searched or

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,240
kind of pokes through reference

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,430
because its reference material and often

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,639
used for other people to find their own

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,740
narrative within it so I might use an

00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,740
encyclopedia to find information in

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,560
order to form thoughts about things I

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,630
know nothing about or for a politician

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,779
to find data in order to build his or

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,360
her political platform narrative on the

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,190
other hand has an agenda it always does

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,540
whether it's trying to sell you

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,940
something or just trying to make you

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,430
feel something in fiction and creative

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,829
nonfiction so novels or magazine

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,560
articles journalism all of that this

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,910
kind of this comes out as a steam right

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,550
it's not trying to sell you something

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,529
but it's absolutely trying to connect

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,050
with you in some way in marketing

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,000
politics and brand related kind of stuff

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,220
this this comes out internally in a

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,110
rhetoric sort of way where it is trying

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,149
to get that connect with you emotionally

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,829
but it's also trying to get you to buy

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,430
something or asked in some in some

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:49,110
fashion so with this agenda narrative is

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,620
telling a story traditional or otherwise

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,079
I hesitated so far to use the word story

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,370
because and I'm kind of feel just weird

00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,540
about it because it gets thrown around a

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,069
lot and I don't think a lot of people

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,260
stop to think what they mean when they

00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:04,589
say story they just want it to tell a

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,910
story so in this case narrative and

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,160
story we're going to use interchangeably

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,540
but narrative is what we're going to

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,459
stick with so by our own framework there

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,290
are four types of long-form content out

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,329
there right now some more commonly

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,639
occurring than others we've got linear

00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:25,199
reference linear narrative exploratory

00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,519
reference exploratory narrative clean so

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,319
let's take a look at what this looks

00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,970
like in the wild and while we're looking

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,290
through these try to think about similar

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,069
content you've seen or content you have

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:39,980
and how they might fit into these matrix

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:44,370
your framework our first example is the

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,410
AMC Association hate happen association

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,800
of american medical colleges diversity

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,769
facts and figures so eloquent its

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,569
purpose well its exploratory in the

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,069
sense that it's presenting a whole lot

00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,510
of data now this report if you don't

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,050
know anything about it I didn't for a

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,880
very long time the perp

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,860
of it is to present a bunch of

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,450
statistical information without forming

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,589
any sort of argument it's just giving

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,510
you the facts giving you the figures

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:13,160
hence facts and figures and so in the

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,660
idea that it's going to be clicked

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,459
around right nobody's going to want to

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,570
read this from start to finish probably

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,920
they're going to be searching for

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,660
something they kind of already have in

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,399
mind they want a figure they want effect

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,880
and they want to build it into their own

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,680
narrative and again the copy is trying

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,360
very hard not to take any stance

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,040
politically speak like there is an

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,640
organization they're very actively

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,250
trying to not take a political stance so

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,110
reference we've got exploratory

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,490
structure we've got reference copy we

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,829
were hoping to actually find more

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:49,399
examples of this but they tend to hide

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:53,269
in PDF everywhere which brings us to let

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:55,100
me a reference there's nothing here now

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,390
they're probably out there kind of like

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,890
the exploratory reference we just

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,500
mentioned but this kind of information

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,079
tends to get stuck either in PDF or in

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,000
behind paywalls or in PDF behind

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,850
paywalls it's like this archaic

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,760
structure that's very much stuck in the

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,430
pre-digital lifetime and coming from

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,490
scientific kind of backgrounds see that

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,990
a lot the types of organizations you

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,149
tend to produce data briefs and other

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,250
reference materials typically do so in

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,779
that print first mentality which means

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,510
it's designed in a publication tool

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:28,130
export it as a PDF and then uploaded

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,490
somewhere and forgotten and moving into

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:36,640
the ether it's funny because I clicked

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:41,590
on something oh no how do I get back

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,330

let's do this we can do this together

second I'm gonna fix it do you want to

fix it tech support really on keep

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,930
talking real fast I can talk loud while

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,300
Kourtney trying to make this better for

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,130
me what I was getting at with this with

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,190
this world bank article that I

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,470
accidentally clicked on they put up this

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:51,940
report funnily enough it appear yes and

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:56,450
probably no one read and they put up a

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,010
great report about how a third of and

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,800
they produce a lot of reports a third of

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,010
their PDF had gone undiluted completely

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,570
and I think over 40 like more than forty

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,880
percent of the rest of their content

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,790
their PDF content had been downloaded

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,160
fewer than a hundred times so there was

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:16,250
a joke in that article that I had again

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,110
accidentally click done there's a really

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,390
funny joke and sort of not funny though

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,540
what if the world's biggest problems

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,430
have been solved somewhere and just the

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,300
depths of a PDF that was never

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:35,420
downloaded it's funny but it's kind of

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:38,540
scary right oh do we fix it yeah dance

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:45,620
dance I'll first thing and I did it

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:48,630
earlier I know they get upset so easily

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,910
ah alright

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,910
so moving on from it well the power from

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,260
attack is over right I was about to

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,590
start singing you guys this is gonna be

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,000
fun okay so our next example is still

00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,830
exploratory but we've moved on to

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,660
narrative so this is uncute it's an

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,940
architecture magazine uses these shorts

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,250
but short bits of narratives throughout

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,730
this larger structure to tell a story

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,610
through a very specific but larger theme

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,500
this could have definitely lived in a

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,950
linear fashion but that the creator's

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,950
chose to spread it out in a very weird

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,890
but interactive fun sort of way again

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,110
using these sub-themes of smaller pieces

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,060
to form this bigger narrative the

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,820
powerful photography supports this theme

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,640
which in this issue is Animal House what

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,020
they're trying to say it's an argument

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,940
thesis we'll get into that missing it

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,280
it's an argument that the animals have

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,080
an Ambo you'll like this animals have

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,080
affected human architecture and very

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,610
real and active ways and it goes through

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,920
all sorts of really cool examples of

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,940
that so narrative in the sense that it

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,990
has something to prove try not to hit

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,270
anything new again exploratory narrative

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,250
so this is coca-cola's annual report you

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,630
click around to where you want to go and

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,770
given that these kinds of documents

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,630
traditional you're sent around

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,150
shareholders it makes sense that a

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,950
shareholder that with tiny shares you

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,780
know I own like one stock encoder won't

00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,460
share and coke might be less interested

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,500
say than somebody was like a twenty

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,570
percent stake in the company so they

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,430
tend to want different information so

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,680
why is this narrative you might be

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,630
thinking it's a report it reports fax it

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,420
reports figures here's how we've been

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,760
doing well this is more than just a

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,530
presentation of data they have a very

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,240
clear thing they want to sell to

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,520
shareholders and that is we are doing

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,550
fine right you invested in the right

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,290
place so invoking a sense of comfort is

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,550
the persuasion in this sense hence

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,170
narrative okay finally this is my

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,570
favorite linear narrative this is the

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,980
low-hanging fruit of long-form context

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,380
it's the easiest to find this stuff is

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,600
everywhere kind of the Golden Goose what

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,460
everyone wants to be people bring up

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,660
long-form they bring up snowfall and

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,220
this is a very similar piece

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,889
Russia left behind is from New York

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,870
Times its journalistic journalism's has

00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,699
had the most at stake in this innocent

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,789
anyway because they've been shaken up by

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,069
this whole web thing so they've been

00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:13,839
spending a lot of money and a lot of

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,049
time to try to figure out how to make

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,079
themselves I don't relish a word but

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:22,510
that's what it feels like so why is this

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,480
narrative maybe you might ask or I would

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,069
anticipate might be asked journalism

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,260
isn't supposed to be outwardly trying to

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,980
convince you of anything except they

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,260
absolutely especially in long form

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,570
format have to be hitting a point that

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,830
says this is how this matters to you

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,049
right they're not trying to sell you

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,669
anything necessarily they're absolutely

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,169
trying to get you to connect to it in a

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:49,750
way because that's what makes these long

00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:51,429
feature like articles good and finally a

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,130
great example from an organization that

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,780
I love the gates annual letter from the

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,000
Gates Foundation this is known in our

00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,380
circles as a shining example of what

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,870
other nonprofits could be doing with

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,390
their content so it's linear and it

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,010
lives on a single page and it has a

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,169
beginning at the top and an end at the

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,850
bottom now this absolutely could have an

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,770
exploratory they've got a really great

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,390
table of contents they've thought

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,740
through this but they made a choice and

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,710
I'd argue they made a good one because

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,450
by making this linear they could

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,909
anticipate that I would be starting at

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,289
the top ending at the bottom and they

00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,480
added all sorts of really cool little

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,610
interactions and added quizzes along the

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,080
way that just served is like punches to

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,789
the gut the further you get down there

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,950
like they knew how I was going to be

00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:36,630
going through this piece and it's the

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:39,490
linear structure that allowed that and

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,799
why is it narrative again it's a letter

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,539
it's a report like a letter to

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,059
shareholders the gates foundation needs

00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,440
to convince readers of this letters that

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,390
the foundation is solving the right

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,820
problems and they're solving them the

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,130
right way this isn't it this is

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,620
evangelizing the Gates Foundation and

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,600
this is a good thing I think but it's

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,960
selling a brand right it's selling big

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,960
ideas

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,059
okay so at this point I hope your wheels

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,610
are kind of turning and you're thinking

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,140
about your own website's content because

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,480
if you have a website you are a

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,300
publisher I'm gonna keep saying that

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,650
until it gets real annoying these are

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,760
all great example to check out and I

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,650
encourage you to keep thinking about

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,530
this and in the kind of framework we

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,680
propose you may have noticed though that

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:28,360
most of our examples are narratives in

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,280
nature and that is not an accident

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,710
stories are essential for making your

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,809
point if you have a point to make you

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,870
need stories whether you're a small etsy

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:41,600
shop or a huge you know world-changing

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,940
nonprofit organization you have stories

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,170
and you should tell them so this is

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,460
where we have to focus a little bit cuz

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,650
we'll run out of time thanks to my

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,570
technical problems and just that I

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,640
blather a lot so let's dig into the

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,440
really abstract kind of head in the

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,690
clouds fun stuff like stories and

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,620
narratives so I want to make one thing

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,050
clear we're going to talk about

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,210
narrative now the look feel and

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,950
structure elements are a part of other

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,210
talks we have in the works but we just

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,410
don't have enough time to get into them

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:12,410
now so heads up so why are we getting

00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,990
all head in the clouds Izzy because its

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,990
simplest story it focuses SR forces us

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,450
to think draw conclusions and emphasize

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,550
it's a form of cause and effect which we

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,890
just really respond well to we're wired

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,420
to look for these patterns and yes I say

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,190
wired to look for patterns it's

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,380
definitely soft legacy and I'm not going

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,030
to like claim like science says this I'm

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,010
not going to do that but there's a lot

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,070
of evidence to suggest that we respond

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,500
well as humans to stories and we just

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,210
understand it better when we're spoken

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,059
to in stories are communicated to in

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,530
stories and telling these stories if

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,570
done thoughtfully and with a good

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,090
understanding of what's needed you will

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,660
always stand out as an organization or a

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,540
person or whoever you're acting for so

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,820
powerful so since we've come up for air

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,370
let's take again a quick look at our own

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,090
point here's what we're asking yeah and

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,130
here is why

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:13,289
and you guys are super experts on long

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,630
form now so all right so let's get into

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,880
narrative and story animals that story

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,860
that's terrible all right so we can be

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,870
constructed all the concrete parts of a

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,669
long-form piece now let's get abstract

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,960
to have some fun so you want to

00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,419
incorporate stories into your design

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,529
into your content no matter what it is

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,270
you're producing it's important to

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,470
understand those key underlying elements

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,220
like what do we mean when we say

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:38,190
narratives there's a lot of elements

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,360
involved with narrative a lot of people

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,590
with opinions on the matter but we're

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,049
going to look at the three most

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,470
important parts the first being plot

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:48,480
might be obvious first characteristic of

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,970
a narrative is that it has a starting

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,950
point it has an ending point there's a

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,409
beginning and an end and on this journey

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,169
from point A to point B stuff happening

00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,820
this is plot it is self-contained and

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,190
while the end might not end for the

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,700
character it's an end for the reader or

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:08,850
the audience this is a narrative plot

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:12,480
mapped out on an XY axis of like time

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:15,299
and level of crappiness so thank at the

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,149
bottom like wake up as a cockroach and

00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,100
then think up top and this might just be

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:23,520
me but like Benedict Cumberbatch

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,059
professing his love for you so it's a

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,429
great story line right so we don't need

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,840
to spend too much time on this idea of

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,000
stories being mappable though because

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,350
tons of other people have done the same

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,659
many people argue that plots can be

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,029
mapped as you can see as an example here

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,620
these eight in particular and again

00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,730
these are you can take these home with

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,039
you with the slide deck when we'll get

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,090
it too involved with these now but these

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,520
were illustrated by a graphic designer

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,230
but we're originally proposed by Kurt

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,940
Vonnegut as the eight-story types now

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,520
this is where it gets a little funny not

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,320
everybody agrees on just eight there's a

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,510
lot of overlap here but you get the idea

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,000
again not meant to be read don't worry

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,830
about digging into these just yet you

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,330
get it stories are mappable and in their

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,890
great reference points for when you're

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,690
ready to start your story plots

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,330
important and now you've got some places

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,110
to start so let's move on to what makes

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:21,490
plots interesting

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,520
I liked you don't have a villain whether

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:27,130
it's yourself a thing a person in a lien

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,980
I don't care you don't have a story plot

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,000
without conflict is your main character

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,220
sitting in her living room binge

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,770
watching Netflix all day with a perfect

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,460
wireless connection a fridge full of

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:42,429
food and no self shame like it doesn't

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,850
at all there's no conflict there's no

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:48,070
story luckily consulate types have been

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,350
mapped out too and lo and behold themes

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,600
have appeared so it's cutting oh it's

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,340
not cutting off okay good you can see

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,799
here I've organized things by person

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,990
versus doesn't have to be person it's

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,809
whatever your and our protagonist is

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,270
could be organization animal again alien

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,860
I don't know so for instance in my

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,870
previous example I won't read all of

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,940
these but just giving you some concrete

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,650
examples of what this looks like my

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,510
character from earlier definitely not me

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,190
sitting her in her apartment all day

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,809
bending on netflix this becomes

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,270
interesting through the following

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:21,940
conflicts you've got person versus self

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,130
she starts to feel really bad about this

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,809
whole like doing nothing all day saying

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,880
and remembers all the people she's blown

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:32,440
off conflict person versus technology

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,730
her wife i stopped working or in the

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,240
middle of a really good daredevil

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,130
episodes like really good part2 conflict

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,549
stupid conflict but it's a conflict

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,710
person versus god floor appears in her

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,720
kitchen for some reason fishing through

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,950
her fridge she grabs beer and runs over

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,840
to where couch and like sit down his

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,340
stairs or down he's like I'm gonna make

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,410
your life miserable again I don't know

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,690
why just pop like though definitely

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,850
conflict and then person versus

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,250
supernatural as another example there's

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,720
a ghost baby living in her apartment and

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,070
while she's watching daredevil she sees

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,919
it out of the corner of her eye it's so

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:11,950
small so scary she panics conflicts

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,540
ghost baby not again but so anyway you

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,910
get it there's without conflict you've

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,590
got nothing and so we've created stories

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,540
ridiculous stories but we've created

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,500
stories through the use of conflict

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,500
added to our plot

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:30,159
finally come on Google here we go we

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:32,470
have theme what is your point you have

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,240
to have a point I cannot stress this in

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,350
the Huff you're telling a story you're

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
selling something I know I've been

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,860
beating that in to everybody here

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,350
whether it's emotion a product a service

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,149
yourself anything when you tell a story

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,399
you aim to convince somebody of

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:50,200
something so I'm going to get really

00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:52,629
preachy here seem right it goes by all

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,100
sorts of horrible phrases that I'm sure

00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:57,940
everybody's got nightmares about from

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,409
undergraduate English Composition what's

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,779
your point what's your thesis statement

00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:03,549
what's your central argument the moral

00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:06,700
of the story the big idea the message

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:09,250
what is your point it is a hard hard

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,220
thing to get a grasp on it's the hardest

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,690
thing about constructing a narrative and

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,039
it's just it doesn't get easier until

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,039
you just like keep trying keep trying

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,139
and keep talking to folks but it is your

00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,480
responsibility to make it happen because

00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:25,059
even with the best plot the weirdest

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,129
conflict like those baby if you don't

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,019
have a theme the underlying point

00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:31,210
something people can connect to you've

00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:34,090
totally wasted your time and it's just

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,980
it's hopeless so there's a lot of

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,299
research out there on theme and so I

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,159
know I'm being super abstract I'm not

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,169
going to recap it all right here but

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,809
we've got some resources and are happy

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:46,120
to continue this conversation after the

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:47,620
talk or their Twitter all the other

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,220
weird ways we have to communicate these

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,929
days like at happy hour so at this point

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,070
I'm being so abstract and I'm getting

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,259
free cheat so I'm gonna let Courtney

00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,539
take over so Courtney please bring us

00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:04,779
back down to her hair no more cause baby

00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:06,639
oh okay so really good points good good

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,509
checklist of things that you need when

00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:11,799
you're constructing a narrative but what

00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,159
does that all mean where are we supposed

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:17,919
to start so I outlined five steps to

00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,230
help you get started the first one when

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,029
you go home today or even now is to just

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,309
review your content right what you're

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:27,370
looking for are things that could fit

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,440
neatly into long-form and so based on

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:32,650
our definite definition you're looking

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,980
for things that are mostly static

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:38,650
two thousand words or more and generally

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,990
self-contained so as you're looking for

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:43,930
those items they may be living in PDF

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,210
they may be a brochure site they may be

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,490
policy reports or research articles

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,220
start looking for those things to see

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:54,340
what we would be fitting for long-form

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,770
and as I said it's time it's time to

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,440
resurrect the PDF nobody is reading them

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,920
anyway make them interactive and

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,690
engaging they're probably living in a

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,460
closet somewhere so we want to resurrect

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,770
them like Frankenstein but like I picked

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:13,660
a cute happy one to make this sort of

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:15,940
fun step number two define your

00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,560
structure and copy type right so you

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,100
have your thing you're like I think this

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,630
would make a great long-form piece well

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,330
you need to outline the structure in the

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,060
copy to know what you're gonna write how

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:30,970
you're going to build it out so number

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,880
one answer the question should people

00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,940
read this from point A to point B is

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,980
there straight line as Christina said if

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,040
the answer is yes you've got linear on

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:45,130
your hands if you if you answer no it's

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,290
more exploratory and the reason why you

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,150
should ask this question is so that when

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,590
you're looking examples you know ones

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:55,690
that are comparable to what you're

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:57,520
hoping to do and to accomplish once

00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,170
you've figured out your structure next

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,750
you need to answer this question about

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,480
copy so are you trying to convince

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,360
somebody of something sounds really

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,190
general but if you if you say yes you've

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,100
got a narrative christina has talked at

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,540
length about narrative if you answer no

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,500
this may be more of a reference

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:20,410
situation now when this happens I'll

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,450
warn you people will say no no we don't

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:25,180
have an agenda we're going to trying to

00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,210
convince anyone of anything and then you

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,100
should ask yourself again are we trying

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,510
to convince somebody of something you

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,590
have to keep asking that question

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:38,350
because what we find usually you are

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:42,860
you're just not being honest about it

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:44,810
and so we see this a lot there we work

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,790
with nonprofits and some of them are

00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,460
just not used to always putting their

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,870
brand out there and being a little more

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,700
direct that they're trying to convince

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:58,820
somebody to take action to be aware of

00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,350
the cause things like that so this is a

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,550
question it's important to ask me a

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:06,470
couple times number three time to check

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:11,810
out example so we shared some great

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:14,320
examples here here's a quick number of

00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:18,080
types for each of the different

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,120
long-form examples we shared so you can

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,430
read that in no reports data reports

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,890
again this is to look at examples

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,760
they're already doing what you hope to

00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,410
be doing it's a good place to get ideas

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,900
see how other people are doing it and

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:37,250
specific specifically for linear and

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,920
exploratory on linear tons as Christina

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:42,160
said right a lot of them are

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,050
journalistic they're written by writers

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,860
and so the linear narrative is really

00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:50,420
great so you see this on BuzzFeed they

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,270
have great feature articles New York

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,100
Times pitchfork does really cool stuff

00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:00,230
because they're incorporating some cool

00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:04,220
audio with it ESPN others like that and

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:06,680
then in a report so on the commercial

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,570
side coca-cola it's hard to see from the

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,370
screen shot but that is there's a video

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,040
actually in the background and it's very

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,830
interactive so it's a cool experience to

00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,390
and then MacArthur Foundation there in

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,640
your report for the last couple years

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:25,040
has been long form quite nice number

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,010
four get your team together and what

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,450
does the team look like so from the

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:34,880
beginning you need to get these people

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:36,800
together New York Times has a huge huge

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
team to do this right and they've got

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,300
lots of writers they have a whole

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,740
interactive team so it may not be as big

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,540
as New York Times but these are some of

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,050
the key roles you'll need when you're

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,030
doing this

00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,680
so it may be five people have got a

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:54,840
couple riders front-end developer

00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:58,200
designer UX back-end developer and the

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,940
purpose here is to remember that a lot

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,730
of people see long form and they're just

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,910
so amazed by the interaction than the

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,890
whiz-bang and they forget like oh yeah

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,390
we've gotta write this stuff now or

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,850
we've got a structure and pull it

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,950
together oh yeah and we have to build it

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,760
and build it not just like make it

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,770
scroll really in a really cool way so

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,480
start thinking about the content early

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:26,190
have a couple writers you need them now

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,410
your team might not be that big right

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,810
people can play multiple roles so you

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,910
may have a team as small as three where

00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:36,300
the writer is also a user experience

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,640
person designer however you want to mix

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,290
and match it it can be smaller the main

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,880
point though is that you need a couple

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:46,410
writers and as Christina will tell you

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,140
writers should never work alone right

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:52,530
just as developers need code reviews

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,980
writers need other eyes and sometimes

00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:01,200
they can get into the weeds so some all

00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:03,360
the time oh so it's helpful to work as a

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,780
team to make sure somebody is pulling

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,880
you up and looking at the big picture

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,440
and the last one number five now it's

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,030
time to actually like get to work right

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,860
brainstorm writing designing and you

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:20,070
need to know the copy and structure

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,140
before you start the copy informs the

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,110
structure and the structure should

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,270
inform the design so another thing we

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,490
see is everyone falls in love with

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,400
interactions and I mean I'm user

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,320
experience designer I love that stuff

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:38,210
but where the project will fail is when

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,540
you lead with it the the design and the

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,830
interaction has to support the copy

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,450
people may scroll through it once if it

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,630
has cool interactions but to actually

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:52,280
have someone engage you have to have the

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,280
copy and structure figured out

00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:00,040
cool so hey where's your pecan what are

00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,510
the drupal considerations so there are a

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,870
couple we talk to our team of developers

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,730
who have been working on this stuff and

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,950
the main thing that comes up is author

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,320
experience right you got a couple

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:14,070
authors you may even have a larger

00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,480
editorial team if you have 10 people

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:20,200
that experience is going to be way

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,570
different from two people so it's good

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,540
to know from the beginning because you

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:28,720
can be deliberate about who's in putting

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,030
what we're making sure you've got

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,090
workflow figure it out and moderation

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:38,050
that becomes way more important as you

00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:40,000
have a larger team of authors and so you

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,630
may need to gate and bet some of that

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,050
stuff the second thing is building

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:49,600
entity relationships so at the core of

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,540
the long-form piece is the content model

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,750
so if you have two types of content

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:58,000
outlining where they meet and how they

00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,070
should be referenced to one another so

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,530
Drupal is a really strong content

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,570
modeling tool so defining the different

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:08,950
types of content and how they relate is

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:11,230
good to know as well and then lastly

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,980
identifying content fields and field

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,810
groups we did a project where a clinic

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:22,330
of ours had a really large report it was

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:26,260
50 pages PDF we resurrected a PDF it was

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:28,480
not as easy as it sounds sort are what

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,280
they wanted to do was pull out

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,470
highlights from the report right that

00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,260
makes sense and they knew that the

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:38,650
highlights would be a video or an image

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,110
or a quote so we had to build a system

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,720
where they could add a highlight and

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:45,520
then fill out the fields for each

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,380
different type of highlight whether it

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,920
was a bit like I said video quote or

00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,360
image um so your developer obviously

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,150
needs to know what types of things

00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,220
you're going to highlight and how if

00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,390
those are going to be reused build it in

00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,359
a way that it can be

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:03,730
reused so in this case the author could

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,069
go in and add a highlight choose what

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:09,970
type of highlight it was and fill out

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:12,849
the appropriate fields so this is super

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,220
important stuff right because how you

00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:21,609
build it impacts the experience people

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:24,400
have the last thing is so how do you

00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:26,289
prove author experience well there are a

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,109
couple ways obviously training and

00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:31,569
preparing staff making sure you have

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:33,750
good labeling back there you know making

00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:36,849
sure your field labels are clear

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,470
tooltips help documentation helps the

00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:41,740
main thing is having that open line of

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:44,230
communication so that once the the team

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,990
has their vision of what they wanted to

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,569
say that when they're ready to input

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:53,349
content they still know where to put

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:56,859
things and last this is just because we

00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:59,920
wanted to embarrass Andy really but Andy

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:03,279
is one of our lead developers and he's

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,039
very passionate about this topic and he

00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:07,420
emphasizes it Drupal is so powerful that

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,240
sometimes that makes the author

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,269
experience tough and he was very adamant

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,180
about that so great platform to do

00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:18,220
long-form just be aware that you're

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,640
gonna have to consider the author

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:24,640
experience when you're doing this all

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:28,509
right guys if you go home and remember

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,569
anything remember these things or try

00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:34,769
you know we're defining long-form as

00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:39,369
something that is 2,000 words or more

00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:42,279
mostly static and self-contained that's

00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:44,170
where we're starting right a couple more

00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,349
things when you're talking about

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,910
structure we have defined it or we're

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,279
proposing that you either have a linear

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:56,079
structure or an exploratory structure

00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:58,359
copy narrative or reference also

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,769
important to know that most of the

00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,750
long-form year and we said this already

00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,190
but it's so important to stress most of

00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,829
the long-form you're seeing today is

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,869
linear narrative and the reason why

00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:08,920
we're pressing on this point is because

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,130
we often have

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,990
to come to us and show us these really

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,020
cool things so the New York Times has

00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:21,760
done or BuzzFeed and they're saying hey

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:24,100
do this for our data report and what's

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,110
hard to communicate is that why some why

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,670
you were so engaged in this is because

00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,120
the New York Times says excellent

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:33,070
writers who wrote a linear piece that

00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,350
you're experiencing so actually you're

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,450
you're asking for sure it's long form

00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,490
and look and feel but the way it's

00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,060
structured is much different the process

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:45,940
of creating it will be very different

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,390
and then lastly oh man if you guys could

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,970
all just take your PDF and pull them out

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,520
of that archive they are such good

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,260
candidates for a long-form treatment and

00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,780
it's a good place to start right because

00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,510
a lot of the copies already written so

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:07,330
you you're adjusting more than starting

00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:10,000
from scratch so again please give it a

00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:13,030
go it's fun it's really fun to do give

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,400
long-form a try give narrative a try we

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,170
have tips in here I also tweeted out the

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,870
slide deck that has all the links in

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:23,290
here so you can reference back to them

00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:26,260
and lastly if you do when your narrative

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:29,290
it's really cool but Christine I would

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:34,330
like to yell at you and say go big or go

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:38,830
home yeah yeah so again here are some

00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:40,720
more resources on websites book Twitter

00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:44,800
you can search for the hashtag long-form

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,300
also good stuff there and then lastly

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,580
thanks thanks for coming thanks for

00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:52,840
listening and you know we're proposing

00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:55,300
that is this outlining what long-form

00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,840
actually is and we'd love to hear your

00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,370
thoughts and challenge us even to

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,890
because we're trying to make sense of it

00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:05,340
today so eager to hear your questions

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,340
thank you

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,220
are you taking questions so one thing I

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,860
noticed right from the outset is

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,810
everything here is focused on words and

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,760
I would argue that some of the best

00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,400
storytellers or narrative tellers and

00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,500
your pieces in your frame are the movie

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,720
makers here in Hollywood and Bollywood

00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,660
in other locations now I didn't see

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,220
anything here on video although there

00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,100
were a couple mentions that was that was

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,840
part of others stories and given

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,760
people's attention now in preference for

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,830
video and just as example as you can go

00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,510
and look for how many tutorials are on

00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,970
Drupal of how many are written versus

00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,800
how many are in video that you'd find a

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,600
lot more people interested in paying

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,300
attention to a well-made video than a

00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,120
well-made a well-written long-form

00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,400
article ya know that's an that's a great

00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,900
point in tisch into it was one of the

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,820
things we considered because it wasn't

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,320
as video movies we were having an issue

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,880
with it was like okay we're to film sit

00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,370
in and we're too or film or

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,810
instructional videos and where do video

00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,190
games sit and this is a big one for me

00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,190
because I also write a lot about video

00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:17,500
games and so we had to kind of just draw

00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,600
a line in the sand and say okay with

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,490
long form content we're just going to

00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,790
focus on words because all of a sudden

00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:27,210
we had this huge just just enormous

00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:30,160
topic so I mean absolutely there is

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,810
totally a case for like okay should you

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,820
consider this to be a video should you

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,230
consider it to be like an ass there are

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,030
lots of other ways this content could

00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,670
live but we had that we had to just

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,680
focus but I absolutely i absolutely

00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:45,970
agree in video games or another big big

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,360
? do I think and a great idea for

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:52,630
another talk okay all right first of all

00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,160
thank you I come from an English

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,610
Composition background so I'm asked a

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,730
horrible question yeah at what point you

00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,760
talked about making an impact and I know

00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:06,460
that we're talking about long-form at

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,260
what point do you start to introduce the

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,540
idea of visual media or interactive

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,310
media in the process of constructing

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,310
your con

00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,140
he does it redefine it at some point I

00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,730
mean and that's my horrible question

00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,760
because my immediate reaction is

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,590
absolutely not but I mean it's in the

00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,090
forefront of your mind right as soon as

00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,280
you start to write especially like a

00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,260
narrative or you you know I hate to go

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,380
back to snowfall button it's definitely

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,870
encapsulated in a way to accentuate the

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,550
visual media yeah i think so that's a

00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,950
great question i think being flexible is

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,110
the session seems like a cop-out answer

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,120
but coming from an agile background i'm

00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,950
pretty sure i'm like beaten into me so

00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,050
in terms of when to start considering

00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,940
those interactions i think once you

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,530
start with the copy and you start with

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,690
the seam and you start with those kinds

00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,520
of really heady ideas and once you get

00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,930
to the point in the process where you're

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,540
starting to think about those kinds of

00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:58,740
interactions that is the right time for

00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,900
those things to be feeding off each

00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,210
other because chances are your big idea

00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,220
is going to stick around but but overall

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,380
if they're going to make each other

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,420
better in all the right ways so do you

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,730
find yourself going back and ria pro

00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,220
qing so in terms not in terms of theme

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,200
usually i definitely in the projects

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,600
I've worked on have gone back and

00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,820
started to reconsider the way I've kind

00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,850
of formed a plot if you will it's not

00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,680
the perfect term here but the plot has

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,630
been restructured but that big central

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,730
idea doesn't really change based on

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:35,070
those interactions okay thank you oh

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:39,030
thank you you're the best elfa ever oh

00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:41,010
thank you so I one of the reasons I

00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,900
really like reading long-form articles

00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,910
is because I can stop and then pick them

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,280
up later and still be able to kind of

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,130
think about it what are some suggestions

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,390
that you might have for things like

00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,680
bookmarking your spot especially if

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,320
you're using scrolling and not

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,750
pagination how do you make sure that if

00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,060
a reader does go away from a piece that

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,260
they can come back and easily remember

00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,850
where they are pick up where they left

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,890
off so that's a great question and

00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,890
Courtney might be better cheesy uxr here

00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,670
obviously the in the gates notes example

00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,410
there's a table of contents and we're

00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,630
seeing more of this in some of the

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,940
long-form examples except especially the

00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,860
exploratory ones where there are clear

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,710
sections do you know where you are as

00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,500
you're going

00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,330
so that's the obvious answer what I

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,820
haven't thought actually is for the

00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:31,089
narrative ones bookmarking a place just

00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,190
like you would in a book right that's

00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:35,530
cool I haven't seen that actually I've

00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,480
seen sites where you can highlight the

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,580
text or they pull out potential tweets

00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,530
that you can have but I haven't seen a

00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,020
place where you can put a marker and

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:47,410
then my next question is like how do

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,240
they know that's your marker and and how

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,000
is it saved without creating a user

00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,410
account and all those fun things so I

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,119
don't I don't actually know the answer

00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,800
but it's a really great question

00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,220
especially because there's such a huge

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,710
tie or comparison between actual

00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,790
literature book and then the long-form

00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:08,140
experience yeah and I think particular

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,900
going to see a lot more kind of

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:12,609
experimentation around this exact idea

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,099
as people are more and more convinced

00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:17,920
that know people do have attention spans

00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:19,330
and they do like to Reeves is crazy I

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,890
think we're finally coming back around

00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,089
and giving people credit on actually

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,740
reading so I well I think we'll be

00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:25,270
seeing a lot more of this soon that's a

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:30,550
great question which we had a better

00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:32,920
comparison I was like this is how high

00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,440
the content authors that I'm dealing

00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,849
with are just now understanding and

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,700
learning the concept of writing for SEO

00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:41,410
so I'm wondering how that all that fits

00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,880
in you know like sprinkling you know

00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,830
keywords within content and body and

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,830
things like that if it's with if it's in

00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,990
a narrative a story format is there a

00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:54,490
different method of writing for SEO than

00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:57,760
what has been traditionally put forth so

00:45:54,490 --> 00:46:00,270
I go by what Google one of Google's like

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,830
top things they say about SEO is like if

00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,330
it's good it if it's structured well

00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:07,540
that is the best thing you can do for

00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:09,430
SEO right and it's not like the quickest

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,170
and easiest answer but if it's if it's

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:14,170
good and people read it it will it will

00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,660
perform well in search engines in terms

00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:18,339
of other keyword style stuff Courtney

00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,930
might know better than that but good

00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,460
stuff

00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:24,700
it's an interesting question right

00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,400
because in content strategy there's this

00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:32,020
whole like creating a piece of content

00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,940
and having it be on tone on message and

00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,980
style guides that accommodate for that

00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,750
and and this is where journalists are

00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,770
really great at it they've been doing

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:43,180
that stuff for so long so it is a new

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,780
way of thinking for people who are just

00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,090
starting to write web content and it I

00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,970
think of it as sort of a parallel track

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,910
with it or even a step that happens

00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:57,730
before where as an organization or as a

00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:03,210
group those defining the tone and the

00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:06,670
key messages should happen early and

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,770
should work across all your content

00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:13,390
right because it's representing that

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:15,370
single organization so we have we walk

00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,990
through messaging architecture

00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,990
activities talking about primary

00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:26,490
secondary and so on messages tone all

00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:26,490
the style guides stuff the ghost baby

00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:33,180
they'll see your question can you say

00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:36,960
your question again because I think I am

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:39,690
I think you did being distracted you

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:43,829
know it kind of makes sense because I

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:47,910
think if the content authors are using

00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:49,530
art are starting to use a lot of the

00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,329
expertise that journalists have used

00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,890
over the years right where you know

00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:55,109
you're highlighting you know what the

00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:57,119
main point of an article is throughout

00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:58,650
the article and kind of repeating key

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,450
concepts of the article that's kind of

00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,550
like sprinkling keywords through yeah

00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,170
content I mean I'm a developer I'm not

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,020
an author's so I'm kind of learning that

00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:10,250
stuff as I go but it kind of makes sense

00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:12,089
that that would be good for SEO

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,589
absolutely my interpretation great

00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:16,079
because you're using the same tone and

00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:19,770
messages and presumably some keywords in

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,720
there oh the other point was going to

00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:24,089
make is that the other thing that we can

00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,190
take from the journalism profession is

00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:28,530
they have a really strong governance

00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,810
model right there's an editor in chief

00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,750
there are section editors and then there

00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:35,970
are authors and staff writers and what

00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,609
we see a lot is that websites don't have

00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:41,609
any governance model it's like the web

00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:44,430
developer the webmaster is owns at all

00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:46,260
and so another thing that we do is we

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,880
like to come in and say who owns this

00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,530
who's in charge of updating it and when

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,619
there's a problem who's going to fix it

00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:54,060
with the content and so a lot of times

00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:56,970
we're retrofitting their governance

00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,400
model but this is another case where you

00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:01,950
may have a writer but there's an editor

00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,520
to review it checks for that stuff tone

00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:08,609
message keywords so there's a little bit

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:14,280
of like structure around it supports all

00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:19,069
of this good question do you have how

00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:21,210
are we doing on time do Oh perfect okay

00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:25,140
so first of all thank you it was a great

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:28,650
presentation so most of the talk kind of

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,750
focused on how to organize single

00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,359
stories and how to set up a narrative

00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,730
for single stories do you ever do you

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,130
ever find that you're applying the same

00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,800
technique to craft a narrative for say

00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:42,340
an entire

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:46,660
website and if so how do you go about

00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,070
doing that so absent mediately recent

00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,880
example on a project online right now

00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:54,460
their goal is to work with people who

00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,350
study stem pedagogy like to study how to

00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,600
teach them and then they're working with

00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:01,210
people who are actual stem practitioners

00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,770
and so they have this really big message

00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,360
and they're actively wanting to tell

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,860
that story and they deploy they came to

00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,560
us and they're super excited about it

00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,940
was a dream come true so what we did on

00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,220
that project in terms of just looking

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,450
how do we make this website tell a story

00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,360
this is a whole nother talk we're

00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,650
working on by the way how do we make

00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,780
this website tell the story so we

00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:23,730
started wireframing we did a whole bunch

00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:26,950
of exercises in a 46 our kickoff 8 in

00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:28,750
any way and tried to get to their key

00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,270
organizational goals their you know

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,480
their values all the brandy kind of

00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:36,730
terms really do dig into conversation

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,190
and then when we started wireframing we

00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,020
wire-framed based totally on their

00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,760
messaging like so we determined what

00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,800
their key messages were and what their

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,960
secondary messages were and we started

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,720
to leave that through our site map and

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,520
our wireframes just based on messaging

00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,160
and that was really really helpful and

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,660
they responded really well to it we're

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,840
currently building that site so I don't

00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,760
know how well it's going to work it's

00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,290
gonna work great but but it's really

00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,360
helped us focus on that story that they

00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,950
wanted to tell and we had a we had this

00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:10,410
whole story discussion it's really

00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:13,060
helpful thank you that's a big help yeah

00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:15,010
the other thing I would add is the same

00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,950
tools I was just talking about figuring

00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:20,920
out messaging in town and its primary

00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,510
message right you can do that for

00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,920
websites to you can do it for

00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,900
organizations or you can do it for

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,110
websites and so that's exactly what we

00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,820
did our kickoff was about like what's

00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:33,250
the big idea why should I care about

00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,710
this and they had a huge team of 20

00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:38,560
people who all had to sort of like talk

00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:41,230
and fight it out to see where they

00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,030
agreed what they thought that the major

00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:46,240
message that they were trying to share

00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,910
and also considering like the audience

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,710
they're trying to tell this story to and

00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,440
make sure making sure it resonates with

00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,660
that audience yeah one more piggyback

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,250
sorry to jump in I think the only word

00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,780
this veers off course from our

00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,550
presentation in terms of websites and

00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,710
crafting stores or on websites is that

00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,230
one you once you've identified the copy

00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,550
or the content as the meat of it as

00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,140
either a narrative you want to see you

00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,610
my story or you to strictly reference

00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,380
once you've identified that instead of

00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:13,000
looking at structure you start doing

00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,340
feature mapping right he started

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,980
brainstorming how that story maps the

00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:24,220
features and all sort of it okay but

00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:26,020
we're rocking or ever about hi so I do

00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,760
have a question but I wanted to mention

00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,070
something that was relevant to that book

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,780
more bookmarking long-form content yeah

00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:37,060
I saw recently bitbucket orbs tutorials

00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:40,720
they've got the long-form instruction

00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:44,140
and then they've got a static menu on

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,630
the side so the content scrolls and as

00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:49,150
the content Scrolls the URL actually

00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,520
updates Oh doesn't match wherever you

00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:53,410
are so if you need a book market for

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,260
like anchor tags yeah yeah what's the

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,700
site called got a bit bucket o

00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:01,510
exploratory old getting started site

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:03,460
that's great nikia and then sorry oh I

00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:05,980
was just going to say yeah absolutely i

00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,930
think the step-by-step instructional

00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,000
stuff that's a good place to look for

00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,460
bookmarking examples so i'm glad you got

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,730
that and then what you're saying about

00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:17,440
the pdfs about resurrecting them do you

00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,480
want to sit are you suggesting we strip

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,180
the content out and put it in web pages

00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,940
or do you want us to redo the PDS and

00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:28,270
keep it in PDF oh no don't keep them in

00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:30,460
pd okay I mean so let's be realistic I

00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,290
mean organization still they need PDFs

00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,880
or they're convinced they do and to

00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,380
print out in the email and share so

00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,000
realistically we're not going to get rid

00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,960
of them all together but that at least

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,840
they should be living online first thank

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
you I think I think the main point is

00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,100
that we're trance like the way we use

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,080
information is obviously transitioning

00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,810
and the PDFs are sort of the thing we're

00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,760
trying to drag along but it's just slow

00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,770
going for some reason I think part of it

00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,010
is because people haven't really figured

00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,020
out how to develop

00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:02,210
up like a long form template that can be

00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:05,510
reused for multiple people or multiple

00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,890
pdfs before so we're actually starting

00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:13,010
to do some of that work with our clients

00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:15,770
but it is it takes time right to build

00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:19,190
out those content types and that whole

00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:21,950
structure and it takes money to whereas

00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:24,550
right now they open Microsoft Word type

00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:29,600
it up insert images and export to PDF

00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:32,360
that's way cheaper and so it's partially

00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,820
a time and cost thing but our point is

00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,320
that it can be way more engaging if you

00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,810
figure out how to publish it on the web

00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,760
it helps your SEO it helps your

00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:42,200
organization's prominence like there are

00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,390
a lot of great things if you're willing

00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,820
to invest in it and that's gonna happen

00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,710
slowly because in education educational

00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,550
programs I mean I witness at first hand

00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:54,140
and grad school they are still educating

00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:56,540
like publication first or non digital

00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:01,130
first design so that's going to happen

00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:04,850
slowly probably not by by those folks hi

00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:06,770
hey I was just gonna sort of pimp

00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:10,670
Eaton's talk from earlier this morning

00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,980
he did basically an exploration of

00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,780
linear narrative content in the

00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,390
long-form style and how to associate

00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,560
rich media back with it and so if

00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,630
anybody's looking at the technical

00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,000
details of you know trying to get that

00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:25,400
content pushed into the actual story

00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,410
you're producing that's a great place to

00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,810
get started talk with that part Jeff

00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:31,940

body people belong as ones yeah
