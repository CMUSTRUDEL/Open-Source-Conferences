Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Constructive Conflict Resolution
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Conflict can be constructive.

Testing ideas by challenging them with alternatives is a useful process. But it can be uncomfortable and confronting for many people.

We value consensus. This is one of the Drupal community's great strengths. However, when consensus can't be reached, valuable time and energy is wasted. Contributions are left to languish forgotten in an issue queue.

This session will outline the types of conflict we encounter in the Drupal community, and explore some techniques for using conflict as a positive force for moving issues forward and avoiding stagnation.

Let's discuss how we can build a culture of respect to embrace the positive aspects of conflict and work together better.

okay Thank You Matthew hey everybody

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,469
last session of the day five o'clock

00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:15,780
this is called dedication so I am really

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,600
really grateful to see people in the

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,210
room right now we're going to be having

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,930
a bit of a conversation in the middle of

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,220
this session I gave this that it's not

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,720
exactly the session because we won't

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,760
know until the end how similar it is to

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,500
how I've done it before but I gave the

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,649
session in Amsterdam and in the middle

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,079
actually want to have a chat and we have

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,149
one microphone so I'm wondering if it's

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,710
not too much of an inconvenience to you

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,719
or would you be willing to huddle a

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,280
little bit in that middle section so

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,860
that it would be easy to pass that

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,180
microphone around so that we can have a

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,820
bit more of a chat and that the

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,110
recording later has you know has what

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,420
you're saying rather than me having to

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,280
necessarily repeat everything I will

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,719
repeat things that for people who can't

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,510
get to the microphone so we don't have

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,519
to wait too much but um yeah that'd be

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,260
really that'd be really cool so thank

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,450
you you know if you don't want to

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,799
participate in that conversation and

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,479
obviously you don't need to huddle at

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,670
the microphone but I just wanted to you

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:21,960
know give you an opportunity to to do

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:25,320
that before we kind of got into it okay

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,930
so my name is Donna Benjamin I'm also

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,060
known as katha crab on Twitter and on

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,890
drupal.org and at gmail so if you want

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,470
to continue to have this conversation

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,340
with me then you can find me using katha

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:49,490
crab constructive conflict resolution

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:54,990
huh hmm so conflict is human nature

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:57,329
really although not exclusively human

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,329
cats and dogs are somewhat famous

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:05,780
enemies right but it kind of underscores

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,780
the conflict is a fairly natural process

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:15,099
we have a natural biological response

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,800
conflict flight will fight the

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,660
adrenaline response adrenaline courses

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,720
through our blood and forces us to

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,690
choose that fight-or-flight mechanism or

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,360
in some cases freeze the kind of rabbits

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,739
in the headlight approach what do we do

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:37,180
I can't make my choice natural conflict

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:40,630
is natural but conflict isn't just war

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,510
when many people think about conflict

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,500
they think about real violence you know

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:52,150
blood on the streets wars but it's often

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,090
it's often much smaller stems from often

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,269
simple misunderstandings or a fear of

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,489
speaking up a lot of conflict begins

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:05,680
with unmet or unexpressed needs right I

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:09,069
mentioned flight or fight but there are

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,500
some other common responses to to

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:18,850
conflict it's easier to walk away to

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,640
give up so avoidance is a is a common

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:26,049
response but I'd say it's not a

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:30,489
constructive response avoidance tends to

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:33,100
help avoidance tends not to help us

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,600
build a better solution so it's a really

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,070
natural thing I was like I really just

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,780
I'd really rather just not know about

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,060
this I really just would rather walk

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,880
away these people are yelling at each

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,100
other I'm going to walk away I can't

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,390
deal with this this criticism that I'm

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,329
getting I just want to walk away so just

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,720
the sense of avoidance but it's again in

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:55,209
that really natural response to to

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,069
conflict in the fight or flight or

00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,930
freeze this is one of the kind of common

00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,400
ones and so one of the things I'm

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,970
thinking about is how do we kind of

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,069
check those natural responses and work

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:10,269
towards constructive responses that's

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:13,569
one of my questions another one is

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,940
denial just try to pretend it isn't

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,859
happening it's not even let your backing

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,919
away it's like just don't acknowledge

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,729
that that's an issue not happening not

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,520
on my radar denying is a problem doesn't

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,669
move

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,240
issue forward it doesn't help anyone

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:34,879
construct a solution right so denial yes

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,379
another really natural response so

00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,060
there's nothing wrong with it right in

00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,770
that sense like we can't escape our

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,960
biology the fight that adrenaline

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,460
response and the way we naturally want

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,440
to respond to conflicts these are

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,970
natural responses are some people like

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,190
to say our lizard brain right our

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,080
amygdala we just have these natural

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,569
responses to conflict and again trying

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,060
to find the constructive way forward

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:59,270
isn't necessarily the groove we

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,090
naturally want to kind of rock to does

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:09,440
that mean make sense and I think it does

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:12,680
all right it's not a game like conflict

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,319
is is is for real and we also have a lot

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,449
of things like you know battleship where

00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,190
we play around with cotton with ideas we

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,409
know the underpinning ideas of conflict

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,740
but it's not again though many people

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,330
will treat conflict as a game or you

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,219
find you may have heard the scene of

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,900
that they're just game players they're

00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:32,900
kind of pushing people's buttons right

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,520
so some people do get into conflict as

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:41,389
though it is a game but if you've seen

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,120
the classic movie wargames you may

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:47,270
remember that the only way to play to

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,979
win is is not to play so if we can try

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,099
and stop the game playing around

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,300
conflict we might be able to move

00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:55,300
forward to something more constructive

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,050
so have this kind of I just wanted to

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,569
pause a moment to think about the

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,599
historical nature of conflict I mean

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:13,669
really history is the story of conflict

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:16,659
right we kind of our human stories are

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,159
filled with tales of war and conquest

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:21,020
you think about kind of an historical

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,710
timeline right there often punctuated by

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,440
you know invasions and revolutions and

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,880
the headings and you know these kinds of

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,569
things that this is something that's

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,810
kind of part of the way we even think

00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:37,030
about our own humanity and where we've

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,950
come from

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,880
even where we might be going the threats

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:47,800
of war and conflict and we've had

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,710
various ways of resolving conflicts some

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,320
have tried building walls in various

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:57,940
places at various times with various

00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,820
effects or building Arsenal's of

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,290
missiles you know what was that you know

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,510
the threat of mutually assured

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:09,340
destruction was a way of avoiding

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:13,390
conflict apparently or perhaps in in

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,280
courtrooms resolving conflict in courts

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,220
it's something that you know it's a

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,930
daily so it's a huge industry right the

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,660
legal profession but I'd argue that this

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,110
is not constructive resolution of

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,950
conflict either there's usually a winner

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:37,540
which means there's also usually a loser

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:40,840
right so whilst it's a less bloody way

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,310
of resolving a conflict I don't know

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,260
that it's necessarily building a

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:49,890
constructive solution to whatever that

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:52,360
issue was so conflict to me really

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,480
challenge is at the heart of conflict

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,610
and I believe this is I guess my key

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,490
premise here is that accepting that

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,720
challenge is is the key to constructive

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,940
resolution to say if someone presents if

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,950
or a pair of people or groups of people

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,320
present with some kind of conflict then

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,640
an underlying that is some kind of

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,110
challenge which represents an

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,510
opportunity for positive change or maybe

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,580
it's from a change which is a removal of

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,530
something which is causing angst and

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,510
grief and trouble right but it's an

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,380
opportunity for change of one sort or

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,270
another which really should be positive

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,870
have the opportunity to be positive to

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,730
recognize that if trouble is is as being

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,560
generated then there might be some coors

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:42,400
underlying cause of that trouble which

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:47,370
is going to be a useful clue to fixing

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,370
something really really meaningful

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,380
we we need to explore and test and

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,110
challenge ideas and I really like this

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,110
quote and you know I think I'm Steiners

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,140
held up as this person of you know great

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,850
genius but I think this idea is really

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,920
useful here and thinking about conflict

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,170
as well as well that we can't solve the

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,330
problems by using the same kind of

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,280
thinking we used when we when we created

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,050
them and to really again get to that

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,900
heart of what is the challenge here can

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,370
we test the ideas blow apart the

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,020
assumptions that are bringing to the

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,800
table they might be right but if we

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,890
don't question them then we don't know

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,030
so sometimes these ideas compete and we

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,820
need some mechanism to rub those ideas

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,280
up against each other I guess in a way

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,330
that causes something useful to come out

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:46,660
of it too perhaps improve those ideas by

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:49,360
by that competition so really what is

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,510
conflict and this is where I want us to

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,370
try and have a bit of a conversation the

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,980
reality is it really does mean very

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,290
different things to different people and

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,980
I think that that difference is at the

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,230
heart of why conflict is actually

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,420
valuable that difference is why

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,120
diversity matters that it's because we

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,280
have different perspectives on what any

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,020
given solution might look like that

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:22,180
means we get an opportunity to improve

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:26,620
that solution so what is it and this is

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,140
where i'm going to turn to you and see

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,210
if we can have a little bit of a

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,920
conversation it's different things to

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,350
different people and we've got a range

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,090
of different people here in the room so

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,430
i'm hoping we might be able to explore

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,250
this idea a little and come to a kind of

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,290
common a common sense just in the room

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,930
today of what conflict means to us who

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:52,600
are here so who's going to be brave and

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:55,150
grab the mic and have a go what do you

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,390
think what is conflict what does it mean

00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:03,320
to you the flip side is maybe you have

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:06,320
an example of a kind of conflict to

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:11,900
illustrate what it means to you you

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:15,110
might have a story yeah please come and

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,190
huddle up so we can have a chat since

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,570
I'm going to be the first to leave

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,970
because I have to catch a train i'll be

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,950
the first to present my thoughts on that

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,680
can I just let us know your name too oh

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,580
sorry I'm I'm Rick Rick pine i right I'm

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,920
actually a local that matters to me a

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,020
conflict is kind of a difference of

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,330
opinion a difference of opinion right

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,030
yeah is that all you were looking for

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,440
yeah no I it's not a library for it

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,840
exactly right but yeah please with a

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,790
problem I just wanted it I guess add to

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,490
that that I liked what you said about a

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,520
conflict is actually underlying it's

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,620
it's a challenge and that is in fact the

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,700
reason that is the challenge is how are

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,610
you going to come to some agreement

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,080
about the difference of opinion and yeah

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,090
I run into that a lot which is why I

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,080
decided to attend this so I look forward

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:06,350
to hearing what other people have to say

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,690
about that thanks Rick yeah uh max

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:14,180
proxima I like what you said earlier

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,740
about a difference in needs so often you

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,310
can be talking about the same thing and

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,510
the same solution will work but no they

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,950
don't you don't know what each other's

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,420
needs are so you can't use the right

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:28,880
language so it feels conflict Laden yeah

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:34,040
right yeah I think that's that's right

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,560
yep a couple of things one is there is

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,110
another way to deal with conflict in

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,550
addition to the ones you listed one that

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:50,660
is very damaging to the self that's

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:53,470
surrender yes but to me conflict seems

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:57,350
to ultimately be a difference in

00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,950
worldview caused partly because each and

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,680
every one of us in this room outside of

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:07,670
this room my cats at home who have

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,809
conflicts with each other each one of us

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:16,859
lives inside our own head

00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:19,699
ultimately each and every sentient

00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:25,410
creature has a different and unique

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:27,389
world view acknowledging that accepting

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,059
that there are different worldviews that

00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:33,239
different worldviews are a strength of

00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:37,019
our species can help us deal with

00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:39,839
conflict but they are all the different

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,029
worldviews are the source of all

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,790
conflict great thank you I didn't catch

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,230
your name Valerie Griffin valor Griffith

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,850
thank you i mean i think that's that's

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,949
absolutely right that sense of worldview

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,009
and thanks for bringing up surrender

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:55,559
it's definitely another another response

00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:59,189
to waive that white flag and yep yep

00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:01,679
thank you hello my name is a Damon

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:04,529
Lowney and I'm going to use a somewhat

00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,529
specific example that's going on with

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,419
our site so on the front end and what

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:12,359
the public sees its really great and we

00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:15,259
also have a really hard working team but

00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:17,699
at the same time one of our other

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,230
in-house developers which is not you

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,239
know the team that built our website and

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,169
he's more of our guy who just maintains

00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:26,879
things I'm not a technical person like

00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,499
extreme I'm kind of like right in the

00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,649
middle probably more on the green side

00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:35,819
of things but uh the membership database

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:39,389
is extremely complicated and has many

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,339
different moving parts and we can never

00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,350
seem to get it working quite right in

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,439
our in-house guy who doesn't specialize

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,480
in Drupal he specializes and some other

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:51,869
programs cold fusion or something like

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,839
that you know he keeps he'll say things

00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:56,160
you know like trying to code and in

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,709
Drupal with at least the membership

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,869
database side is like trying to code

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:04,139
with boxing gloves to get to do what he

00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:06,059
wanted to do and so for our organization

00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,739
it's kind of you know I'm trying to keep

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,309
both sides happy and I can tell that

00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:12,660
he's getting exists exasperated yeah so

00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:18,629
what do you think is his underlying

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:20,220
challenge well I know that you know the

00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,689
company he works for did bit on the

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,510
website and you know there was all sorts

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,580
of different

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,930
political sort of pieces that go

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:32,090
together and come along with

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:34,040
associations but you know we like having

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,510
him on the team a lot you know it's you

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,550
know he's been part of the team for a

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,440
long time so I think he just wants it to

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,620
work right and I think he just is

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,570
getting frustrated yeah well I mean

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,240
frustration is a real is an often a real

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,100
core so I guess the challenge for you

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,840
guys is to really get at the heart of

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,450
that frustration and see where and how

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,040
it could be mitigated you know it

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,460
doesn't mean is there something that

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,080
it's a is it is it he's learning journey

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,840
that is frustrated because he doesn't

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,080
have her skills yeah he's catching on

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,620
pretty quickly with with Drupal um but I

00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,900
guess it's just not his platform I guess

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,430
yeah right right so he's familiar with

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,470
he's being asked to swim in an

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,490
environment that that that's not natural

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,320
to him yeah I mean I think that really

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,980
illustrates yet another kind of element

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,410
to it right is it's not necessarily an

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,410
obvious fight going on but someone is

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,840
you know just really struggling with the

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,520
broader environment and that causes that

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,770
has a ripple effect on all of the people

00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,960
around him because you know he can't

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,700
play the game in in the way that

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,510
everybody else is so he's got a natural

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,000
you know a natural unmet need to be able

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,410
to really collaborate it sounds like you

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,140
alluded to there might have been some

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,900
some sort of political hurt feelings

00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,690
about not having had his option chosen

00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,110
as well yeah there's a lot of work for

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,560
us just you know you'll attach it to the

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,839
website you know build a page using his

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,410
programs when we need to yeah right nice

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,970
and quick so um as I go through the rest

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,620
of the presentation there's a few tools

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,329
at the end and and they might be

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,600
something to look up and see if that's

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,160
going to help resource you to be able to

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,430
address some of those some of those

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,380
challenges thank you thank you hi my

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,920
name is Cheryl Schmalz I Cheryl and

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,190
conflict for me is when my expectations

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,510
don't match my reality yeah beautifully

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,880
beautifully succinct when my

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,450
expectations don't meet my reality yes

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,450
sorry don't

00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,970
yeah well my expectations don't meet my

00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:46,799
reality and I think that's really

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,460
there's a nice sums it up that's

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,139
tweetable as they say thank you anyone

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,210
else have any thoughts on on conflict

00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:58,679
that they want to want to share yeah

00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,539
please my name is Tim nafziger and along

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,279
with working with Drupal I've been part

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,169
of an organization called Christian

00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,029
peacemaker teams that specializes in in

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:10,409
some of these air I'd like to talk to

00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:11,999
you later I'd be happy to talk so when I

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,049
think about conflict to elaborate on

00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,359
something you said earlier about the

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,649
health of conflict I think it's also

00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,399
important to acknowledge the role

00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:21,779
conflict plays and change processes you

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,830
haven't given any specifics but you know

00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:27,359
bringing symphony on into the drupal and

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,279
drupal 8 cause a lot of conflict and

00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,279
that's that's a part of a change process

00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,409
and you know building ownership of a

00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,850
change process is about conflict

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,080
resolution as well so i just think

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,859
there's a lot of very interesting pieces

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,649
we could mine there around change in

00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:46,739
organizations and change in systems yes

00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:48,960
thank you very very useful and that

00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:51,899
change management is a whole field of

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,179
how do you actually address the conflict

00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:56,070
that bringing change in and I don't

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,809
think we've got those pieces in the

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,269
community about how we respond and deal

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,499
with stuff so would really like to bring

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,999
that on board you know about the

00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:05,669
conflict resolution and community

00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:07,710
working group stuff and yeah great

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:12,269
thanks to him hey Matthew Matthew

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:16,080
Saunders to me conflict is a collision

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:18,859
of opinions ideas or understanding that

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,950
creates disagreement and often anger

00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:27,149
very and I say that again a collision of

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:31,169
opinions ideas or understanding that

00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:33,779
creates disagreement and often anger yep

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,369
I like that any on anyone want to

00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,529
respond to that as a different as a kind

00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:38,999
of nice little definition of the having

00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:42,539
summed up a few of the things that have

00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:43,799
been said yeah seeing some nods anyone

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:49,320
got anything else they want to add

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:50,210
before we kind of move on a little okay

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,700
so

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,920
um apologies to people watching this

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,080
recording after the fact now what I'd

00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,630
actually like to do is have you have a

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,260
quick chat with someone beside you and

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:05,750
share just share an example of a

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,540
conflict it may be a work or a personal

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,890
or a community or whatever and just

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,660
identify what the quickly what that

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,180
conflict was and whether or not there

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,680
was a resolution whatever that may have

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,650
been and whether you felt that it was a

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,000
constructive or not kind of solution so

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,710
I think I just want to kind of get that

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,400
those ideas bubbling and have some

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,380
things in mind as we go forward so just

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,820
you know wherever you happen to be just

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,440
turn to the person who's nearest and

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,470
just have a quick chat I just want to I

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,300
just wanna have a little bit more

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,300
bandwidth than than me talking at you

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,900
you

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,120
okay we probably don't have time for a

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,580
report back from everyone but if you if

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,360
you do if maybe we could just get a

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,950
couple of quick report backs on any

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,150
insights or revelations that people

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,730
might have had out of that conversation

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,260
anyone want to grab the mic and share a

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,260
quick thought out of those conversations

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,059
we probably don't have we don't have

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,280
time for a report back from every single

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,740
little conversation but does anyone have

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,240
any kind of moments of inspiration or

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,510
revelation that they want to kind of

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,770
share back with the with the poor people

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,300
who've been wondering what's been going

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:25,980
on for the past five minutes on the

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:31,380
recording yeah you have to use the mic

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:35,280
yeah yeah thank you I probably say

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,559
communication is probably key here

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,400
because you know we have two sides you

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,300
know to our web presence and you know

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,940
they're they're probably not

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,340
communicating is there I guess their

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,740
issues that they have with you know the

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,690
whole system as a whole right to each

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,710
others as well as they could be in nor

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:58,740
of I as well as I could so communication

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,660
getting clearer building clarity around

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,970
what's being communicated and how it's

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,990
being communicated exactly nice thank

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:11,070
you okay so one of the other things that

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:13,800
I think is a really important sort of

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:19,230
facet of this of this issue as a whole

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:21,840
is there's culture the different ways we

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:25,130
approach conflict is really is often

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,080
quite quite cultural and one way only

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,910
operating in a single culture or our own

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,580
culture it's sometimes harder to see

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,860
that when we come up against a very

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,030
obviously different culture and we see

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,740
that you know these people are

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,070
responding in different ways it becomes

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,950
more obvious but even within our own

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:46,260
culture we can still come with different

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,370
assumptions out you know individual

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,320
families may have to

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,809
from ways of operating we may have

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,790
learned different ways of responding to

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,309
conflict from our families from the

00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:59,220
patterns of our generations that came

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:01,200
before us so it's very cultural I think

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,570
it's also very gendered like you know

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,380
again different cultures will have

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,240
degrees of how much this this impacts

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,780
but you know men and women will respond

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,600
differently to conflict there are

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,700
horrible stats about you know the

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:23,640
violence in general in in our community

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:27,600
being predominantly acted by one gender

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,010
on another so you know there are there

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,170
are some elements in there that it

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,990
really pays to be aware of and to just

00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,150
kind of check sometimes when dealing

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,580
with conflict and having a response to

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,950
them these things are not always easy to

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,720
understand either when I go back to our

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,240
you know our amygdala our natural

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,309
responses our natural response is to

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,480
respond and don't necessarily take a

00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:53,700
step take a breath and be mindful about

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,690
that response so it's not always easy

00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,120
and I think one of the other ones which

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:04,080
perhaps is less over there are less

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,330
generally understood is authority in our

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,030
relationship with authority is how we

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,860
respond to conflict like if someone in a

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:15,000
position of authority to you tells you

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,580
to do something you're your natural

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,740
inclination to do what they said is

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,890
going to depend on that authority

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:27,150
relationship right and and this is one

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:30,960
where as an Australian we tend to have a

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:34,170
much shorter what we call a power ratio

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,210
index like our respect for authority is

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,210
somewhat famously pretty non-existent

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,380
and so if I'm given an order by someone

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:48,600
in authority and I have reason to

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:53,150
distrust or think that's wrong in some

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:56,190
way I'm likely to say so one of the

00:27:53,150 --> 00:28:00,210
amplifications of this is this is really

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,770
crazy anecdote but Qantas pilots have

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,900
also actually New Zealanders are even

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:08,510
better at this than Australians but that

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,830
Qantas pilots have been notoriously

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,740
questioning of command when it's been

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,390
wrong and and at some point someone did

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,190
research and identify that this was

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,980
actually one of the underlying reasons

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,500
for Qantas's safety record the flip side

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,450
of it was research was done on why I

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,830
can't remember which but I think it may

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:31,140
have been a Korean airline their black

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,850
box recorders stuff found that yes the

00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,250
the pilot had actually made terrible

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:42,660
mistakes and none of that pilots second

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:44,670
in command were willing to overtly say

00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,490
hey that's a dumb thing don't do that

00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,800
they but they could hear in the coded

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,540
responses that the sense that this that

00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,060
others thought it was wrong but they all

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,690
went down with that plane because they

00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:00,540
weren't willing to they weren't they

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,580
just couldn't reject his authority I

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,380
mean that's a tragic that's a tragic

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,110
amplification and the entire airline

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,050
industry changed as a result of

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,240
understanding that power distance ratio

00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,310
and that dynamic so that I think is

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,430
there also a good example out of tragedy

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,950
to show that we can check our natural

00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:23,190
responses when we become aware of what

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,690
they are likely to be maybe I'm an

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,730
optimist but I think I think there's

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,650
some kind of positive positivity out of

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,400
that that we've now got a much much

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,650
safer although this past year perhaps

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,730
something else is going on but you know

00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,170
that we actually have a much safer

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,080
airline industry because of that

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,850
understanding but I think one of the

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,840
other parts of that is if you are going

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:49,200
to reject a command from authority that

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,820
that needs to be done with respect but

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,460
I'd say respect is even bigger than that

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,570
respect is actually at the real heart of

00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,900
the way I've been thinking about

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:03,180
constructive conflict resolution that we

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,070
have to respond with respect to no

00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:10,429
matter what that response is going to be

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,610
in most martial arts

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:15,820
we start with a bow we might be about to

00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:19,690
kick the out of each other but

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:23,720
we're going to start with this very deep

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,210
action and symbol of respect it's

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,669
showing respect to our opponent and it's

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,019
putting respect front and center when

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:31,249
we're about to when we disagree with

00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:34,009
each other it's like I'm about to have

00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:35,720
you know really do you some damage

00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,539
hopefully because I'm going to win this

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,289
fight but I'm you know we say we start

00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:44,119
with respect and it's crucial and I say

00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:50,029
that it's also there's two sides to it

00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:52,369
it's not just a kind of abstract sense

00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,590
of respect but it's to be respectful but

00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,110
also to feel respected that it's coming

00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,990
back the other way to build this kind of

00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:03,529
bridge of trust is that respect is on

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:07,100
both sides is held in both sides now I'm

00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:09,769
kind of enjoyed dresses keynote this

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,649
morning and and he he actually had this

00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:15,049
quote as I think one of his lessons this

00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:18,139
morning was that honest disagreement is

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,580
often a good sign of progress and and

00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:21,679
again I think that just kind of

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,809
amplified to me this journey that I've

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,299
been on about looking at constructive

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:29,570
conflict resolution and that this sense

00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:31,999
that challenge and disagreement is a

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,470
useful thing in this sense that it's a

00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:35,389
good sign of progress really kind of

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,029
like was a bell ringing of resonation

00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:41,499
for me this morning's like yes that's

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,600
that's the case if we don't have

00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:46,789
disagreement we're probably not really

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:52,639
moving you know this is the sense of

00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:55,659
progress and the thing about having a

00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,809
disagreement is doing it in an

00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:01,940
environment of of trust that you can

00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:06,190
disagree with someone but still be able

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:08,960
to have a useful productive friendly

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,299
collegiate relationship with them that

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,639
we can agree you know they're all agree

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:17,629
to disagree perhaps and move on but that

00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:19,879
we can disagree respectfully to get at

00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:21,950
the heart to find the challenge and

00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:24,150
address it in a way that's constructive

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,330
that brings the progress that

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:29,610
project the patch the relationship

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,770
whatever whatever that kind of context

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,750
of conflict is that we acknowledge

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:37,770
what's at the heart of it and can move

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:40,560
forward just that we can find common

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,990
ground I think that's the real key

00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,450
sometimes like one in my work in the

00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:48,090
community working group the most

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,000
upsetting to me as the kind of mediator

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:55,530
is when I can't get people to at least

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,700
to the table even to explore what it is

00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,650
that's at the heart of their

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,690
disagreement when they just turn around

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,680
and just you know they can't even find a

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,930
little bit of trust to try so trusting

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,970
that we can find common ground if we try

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:13,080
i think is this next part so we have

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:14,820
respect and trust we should have mutual

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,410
goals and values especially if we bring

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,880
this back to the context of the Drupal

00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,160
community we all want Drupal to be

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,130
awesome right and if you don't then I

00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,960
think you're at the wrong conference

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,800
right so there's some assumptions that

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,930
we you know we make that mean let's hope

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,180
that you know we can we can find that

00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,840
that common ground that mutual goals and

00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:38,520
mutual values but ultimately I think if

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,090
you've got respect and trust there's

00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,450
another another corner to the triangle

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:48,090
that we need and that's compassion

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,880
sometimes you can't find a really useful

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,010
solution and you have to be really

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,870
compassionate about the person who's

00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,060
bringing their grievance to you you may

00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:01,170
not be able to solve their challenge it

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:03,510
may be real and egregious and just a

00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,550
really hard problem but that doesn't

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,800
mean that they're wrong or that their

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,540
voice shouldn't be heard or that their

00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,060
you know their challenge shouldn't be

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,800
understood so to bring that sense of

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,409
compassion and understanding is really

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,899
important the flip side is maybe they

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,669
need to bring some compassion to the

00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:23,010
table and understand the damage they're

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:25,409
doing maybe they need to build a sense

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,929
of compassion and put different shoes on

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:31,440
and see that the behavior that you know

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,390
they're kind of railing with is is is

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,340
problematic but that's that's a hard

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:38,060
role as well but I I kind of feel that

00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,040
these are the three things like trust

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,810
respect and compassion really get you a

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,390
long way to that's sitting at the table

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,730
and finding those common goals to find a

00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:50,220
solution to put challenge and and

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,040
conflict on the table in a useful way

00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:58,050
rather than necessarily just walking

00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,090
away from I talked before about there

00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,610
being non constructive ways to solve

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,600
conflicts those will always be in our

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:10,110
toolkit sometimes that's the only way

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:13,200
but I have hope that most of the time we

00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:21,000
can pause and find a constructive way

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:25,650
forward you know if you disagree you can

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,470
pull my hair you can smack me in the

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,530
face alright these are non constructive

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:35,520
ways of solving things you could bite me

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:38,010
on the chin I love this picture but

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,940
usually you know those kinds of brooches

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,280
just really end in tears you know it's

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,630
it's just doesn't make anyone happy at

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,700
the end of the day I don't know that

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,990
it's necessarily solved the problem we

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,150
may have stopped talking about the

00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,980
problem but I don't know that anything

00:35:51,150 --> 00:36:00,060
useful as necessarily come out of these

00:35:52,980 --> 00:36:04,530
kinds of approaches Springs us to Drupal

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,380
drama now I heard some chuckles hands up

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,150
overnight just for the you know the sake

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,670
of day hands up those long term members

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:15,510
of the Drupal community for whom Drupal

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:19,590
drama is rings very you know like a bell

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,820
yep you know we we have had a few of the

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,740
time well I don't think we need to know

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,900
I can repeat this one who wants to call

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,440
out a kind of famous triple drama that

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:35,240
they're aware of just so we've got some

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:40,080
common common language sorry rage quits

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:42,350
repeated over and over mm-hmm yep any

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,350
others

00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:55,069
who said what inappropriate thing during

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:58,970
what presentation yep absolutely the

00:36:55,069 --> 00:37:00,410
others so you know some that went when

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,299
ended up going really well when we

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,579
introduced the drupalcon code of conduct

00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:07,069
there was a first draft there was a lot

00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,630
of gnashing of teeth and itching of

00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,799
brows and the issue queue I don't know

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,599
if he can mash your teeth and that

00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:13,880
you're browsing an issue qubit that's

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,319
just for a minute say you can and then

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,299
there was a second draft which was then

00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,549
more widely adopted so that wasn't that

00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,140
was one of those examples where you know

00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:22,819
it may have been quite a painful process

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,950
to go through but the end result was

00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:28,279
definitely a constructive you know a

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,339
constructive outcome the get migration

00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:33,260
was a honest kind of honest disagreement

00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:35,660
and debate and that one you know perhaps

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,609
wasn't so much drama but just as a you

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,869
know a really good process to work

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,809
through there's been some others where

00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:47,029
you know we haven't perhaps addressed

00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:48,799
and resolved the issues being being

00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:52,250
brought to light and have ended up in a

00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:53,869
fork such as backdrop so there's a few

00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,269
there are a few different things and

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:57,829
then there are sort of smaller micro you

00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,599
know between particular people or

00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:01,430
individuals that you know perhaps have

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,589
ripple effects to others they may not

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,390
that the protagonists may not be aware

00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:07,789
of the impact they're having on others

00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:11,660
so this is something that goes on in our

00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:14,900
community a lot in various shapes and

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,640
sizes and degrees and we've developed

00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,369
some governance and a community working

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,710
group to try on to try and get around

00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:24,890
them one of the key things though in the

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:29,180
Drupal community is we have this we

00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:32,089
really value consensus we actually value

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:36,920
it very deeply and we work hard to

00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:38,930
achieve it we test ideas and we work

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,940
towards finding common ground we can all

00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,650
agree on and we work and we work and we

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:47,230
work and we work until we can find that

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:50,509
common ground sometimes too perhaps the

00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:55,160
the detriment of progress sometimes it

00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:57,470
leads to stagnation I've actually

00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,150
skipped a slide the sense of you know

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,010
wanting

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,750
same thing but not necessarily working

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,150
together towards it takes a while

00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:07,200
sometimes you realize oh hang on we can

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,200
just both point in the same direction

00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,740
stagnation though is the flip side to

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,589
consensus when we can't reach consensus

00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:18,339
we drop a lot of activity and energy on

00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:21,490
the floor we lose a lot in this waiting

00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:25,270
for consensus that's never going to come

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,950
when no one's idea can win we can't get

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,349
consensus vast amounts of time and

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,029
energy are wasted when we've only we

00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:33,220
could just have figured out a little bit

00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:35,740
sooner that we all wanted the same thing

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,440
the challenge is in when we don't want

00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,950
the same thing and we can't reach stick

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:48,910
and we can't reach consensus what do we

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:53,940
have where do we get nothing yuck it's

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:56,950
just where to stagnation is not healthy

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,109
so how do we avoid this how do we break

00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,549
these stalemates because I think this is

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:02,680
an important point as conflict isn't

00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:04,599
always you know raging wars but

00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,760
sometimes it's it's the very iterative

00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,400
sort of if that's the yang and conflict

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,010
can be the yen it can be silenced it can

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,230
be ignoring it can be absence of

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:18,880
progress it can be nothing so that's

00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,940
it's important to be as mindful of that

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,260
as well so one of the things we've had

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,289
is the code of conduct we've had it for

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,630
a while now and I kind of I couldn't

00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,920
even tell you what yeah we finally got

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,410
it we got a code of conduct Greg

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,970
probably knows off the top of his head

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,619
and then later we added the drupalcon

00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,109
code of conduct so we had our code of

00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:40,240
conduct for our project and our online

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:42,130
personas and then we went through a

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,500
process of having one for events such as

00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,900
this and that's been around but we had

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,329
some unfinished business in the code of

00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,549
conduct we had a to-do item which was a

00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,529
conflict resolution process now we got

00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:56,020
that on board last year we've done that

00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:57,849
now which is really you know a real

00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,039
relief and we've actually even had some

00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,420
test runs now and gone through the

00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,039
motions and people are starting to

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,720
understand that that process is around

00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,730
and exists and using it which is really

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,950
useful so people are sort of saying hey

00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,380
you know kind of conduct and you know

00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,970
maybe

00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,260
should have a chat about this offline if

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,900
they're seeing things so we've even got

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,810
bystanders now getting active in this

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,490
process which is particularly gratifying

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,140
to me because one of the things I've

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,910
always wanted is is a Drupal

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,300
peacekeeping force or kind of like a

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:29,060
Peace Corps fork or you know how do we

00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,070
keep the peace and and that is that has

00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,600
to belong to all of us like when people

00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,940
have an issue with each other let's not

00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,980
so it's just another Drupal drama at

00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,870
single maybe there's something in that

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,430
issue that means we really should stop

00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,470
and pay attention maybe there is an

00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,480
opportunity here to to really move our

00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,510
project forward together because we have

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,820
this underlying common common value and

00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:53,120
common goals in making Drupal awesome

00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,280
how do we keep the peace so drupal.org /

00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,050
conflict resolution is where that lives

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,560
and it's really you know it's really

00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:02,180
pretty simple just to go back a bit

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,070
though you know it's the culmination of

00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,720
work begun by others the community

00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:09,470
working group kind of finally brought it

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,840
home but it started with with a series

00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,870
of blog posts that Randy Faye wrote

00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,330
about governance we we continued some

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,070
work at the first community summit in

00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,750
Prague we brainstormed conflict goes a

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,110
whole lot of stuff and I brought a

00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,940
document from my local state of Victoria

00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,640
the Human Rights Commission had a

00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,350
conflict resolution process that

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,970
organizations could adopt so we brought

00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,490
a whole bunch of things to the table and

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:37,150
we distilled it down we ended up with

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:40,640
with this a three step process

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,890
essentially step one is to try to talk

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,170
to each other and it doesn't sound like

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,970
rocket science really does it to see if

00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,040
you can just step outside that conflict

00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,890
for a moment and work out what that

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,710
issue is between you two spores the

00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,510
natural reaction to pause the adrenaline

00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,660
response and just take a breath and say

00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,340
hey ok let me really hear what your what

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,070
your chat what your your war your

00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,960
problem is what's your problem right but

00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,670
to do so respectfully with compassion

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,130
and to trust that you do have common

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,170
ground right have that conversation it's

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:16,280
not always possible though right if only

00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:19,340
it were that easy so step to ask someone

00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,450
else to mediate ask a trusted colleague

00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:26,000
or a friend anyone a bystander

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,650
so hey what do you think where I'm

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,480
thinking that so I was thinking that

00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,680
we're just not getting anywhere can you

00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,950
help us take that next step ask someone

00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,930
else to help mediate the dispute and

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:41,000
then the third one should that also not

00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,370
work as to reach out to the community

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,650
working group there are four of us I'm

00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,960
the chair Angela Byron who are speaking

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,700
in this room before me has so many hats

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,020
in the community I can't believe she's

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,870
on the community working group as well

00:43:51,020 --> 00:44:00,740
George de met and Adam Hills we we we

00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:02,840
meet weekly to discuss hopefully mostly

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,420
policy stuff like getting a conflict

00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,430
resolution policy process in place but

00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,780
also dealing with issues between members

00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,470
of the community who haven't been able

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:14,450
to resolve it through steps one and two

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:17,720
we have an incident report form where

00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,100
people can can report issues that

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,750
they're seeing and we've seen people

00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,550
report their own issues and we've seen

00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,650
bystanders come and say hey these people

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,180
are just at each other and it's not

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,890
going anywhere and I don't think it's

00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,600
doing anyone any good and they bring it

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,380
to our attention and so we can sort of

00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:37,340
step in and help but again there's only

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:41,030
four of us I really want this piece call

00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,830
for core I really want more people to be

00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,730
able to understand this general approach

00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:49,370
to say it's okay for us to have conflict

00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,410
that's not the problem here problem is

00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,930
that we're not necessarily skilled and

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:56,240
resourced to deal with it in a way

00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:58,760
that's constructive and that's my key

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,000
thing here how do we say okay conflict

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,860
happens fine what's the opportunity here

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,040
and I think that could be really

00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,590
positive at least I hope so I'd love to

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,060
see this army of empowered bystanders

00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:15,380
willing to help and maintain the peace

00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:18,170
to stand up to speak up but I think we

00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,630
might need to skill up to do that and so

00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,970
I've been looking at what kinds of tools

00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:25,490
we could use to do that and then I need

00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:27,350
the next step is how do we disseminate

00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,700
that in a really useful way throughout

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,650
our community and that's again another

00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,880
opportunity for conversation like I

00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,920
think there's a lot of things we could

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,690
do we can't do them all at once we don't

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,890
have the resources but I think it's

00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,120
worth thinking about

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:42,310
do other people think it's worth

00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:45,350
thinking about seeing some nods yet cool

00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:47,390
so one of the ones one of the frameworks

00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:51,290
for thinking about conflict and this is

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,340
just sort of quick tour through some of

00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,260
the things I've been looking at is the

00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,400
sense of the drama triangle it's a

00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,750
useful model for thinking about

00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,360
interpersonal conflict there's a

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,250
persecutor a rescuer and a victim hands

00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,500
up if you ever found yourself drawn into

00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:08,480
a drama conflict and felt confused or

00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,520
uncomfortable about what happened

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,020
there's a few hands right it's a pretty

00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,870
calm one there's a chance you've been

00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:17,420
drawn into this sort of negative dynamic

00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:19,490
but but not necessarily aware of it it's

00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,350
a really seductive one and it's a common

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,410
one and it's actually won a lot of

00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,300
people have learned and so it's again

00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,890
almost fits into their natural response

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,490
this is where I naturally go and I'm

00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:35,210
feeling threatened or in danger or upset

00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:37,580
or hurt or just pissed off there's a

00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,190
flip side though and that's the

00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:42,260
empowerment dynamic it's an alternative

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,940
to challenge and create so instead of

00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,250
what we had before we've got a creator a

00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,470
challenger and a coach the victim

00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,660
becomes a creator the persecutor becomes

00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,640
a challenger pushing others to acquire

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,260
new knowledge and skills and strive to

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,510
be their best and the rescue becomes a

00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,400
coach supporting and assisting and

00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,930
facilitating from the sidelines rather

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,150
than getting sucked into that I'm going

00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,160
to save you it's just all so not a

00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,630
helpful response and when the community

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,180
working group needs to be really mindful

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,100
of that's not our job right how do we do

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,660
this in a way that isn't second our

00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:16,400
souls dry another one is this I'm I'm

00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,160
okay you're okay people heard of this

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:24,130
one yes some to nodding others know so

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,110
I'm okay you're okay really talks about

00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,210
helps you articulate different power

00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,890
relationships in sort of someone feeling

00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,530
superior and someone feeling inferior

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:36,050
I'm okay you're okay we're all okay and

00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:38,270
we're unlikely to have sort of an issue

00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:41,330
with each other I'm not okay and you're

00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:44,870
okay I'm being subservient to you the

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,670
flip side is your arm I'm I'm kind of

00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,760
talking at you like what I'm doing right

00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,070
now know the parent voices you should be

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,020
doing

00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:54,840
right these kinds of things and then the

00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,490
you know the the really negative 1 is

00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,770
where no one's okay you know I'm not

00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:02,130
okay you're not okay and that's kind of

00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:03,870
pretty pretty lower not particularly

00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,250
useful but it's it's a really good on

00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,720
it's been around for a long time and

00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,090
there are some strategies there about

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,260
shifting from the automatic response

00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:14,610
their nonviolent communication again is

00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,150
this one that's familiar to some of you

00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:20,070
hands up yes I've only recently become

00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:22,560
aware of nonviolent communication it was

00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:25,380
kind of like you know the lights going

00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,170
on of a really useful way of talking and

00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,860
using language really powerfully you

00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:34,560
know it nvc is about being very very

00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:37,950
mindful and clear about observations

00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,880
feelings needs and requests and it was a

00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:43,290
request part of it that really kind of

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,690
really worked for me in the sense of

00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:47,730
describing your own feelings expressing

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:51,240
your needs and making a request rather

00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:53,400
than a demand or the flipside leaving it

00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,740
totally unexpressed it's like just a

00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,750
request would you be willing you know

00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,600
given you've made the observation you've

00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,600
expressed the feeling and and the need

00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:08,120
to then make the request of the person

00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,120
to do something differently Matthew

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:21,310
that doesn't sound right oh yes thank

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,610
you see nvc thanks typo so the slide is

00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:27,190
wrong it should be C n vc for

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:30,850
non-violent communication thank you very

00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:33,850
much Matthew and Barbra Valerie Valerie

00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:36,400
thank you so I'm expression need and

00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,170
make a request so it's really useful and

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,430
I've got more reading to do on this and

00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:41,650
I think there are workshops so again in

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:43,330
that skill up maybe this is something

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,130
that happens around the world there

00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,530
might be workshops and stuff that local

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:51,160
meetups could kind of get a speaker from

00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,930
just talk about how do we get more skill

00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,550
up our communication the way we scale up

00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:58,450
our tech skills right we go learn a new

00:49:54,550 --> 00:50:00,480
tool well here's some tools another one

00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:03,820
is powerful non defensive communication

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,920
this this i think has learnt from nvc

00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,860
and taking it in a slightly different

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,430
direction and this one this one really

00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:14,140
is for me is very much summed up in that

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,900
sense of take a deep breath before you

00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,850
enact your natural response your natural

00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,380
response will be to defend yourself in

00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:25,900
some way or another if you're feeling

00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:28,240
attacked so instead of just responding

00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:31,210
from that natural scent that natural

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,760
base pours ask a question make a

00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:36,730
statement and this is what like NBC does

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,310
is observe observe ations being very

00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:42,490
precise about what's happening

00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:46,840
statements and then the final part of

00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:49,300
emmett pndc ask question make statement

00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:54,400
and predict the consequences so in this

00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:56,890
case it's like if if you say if you do

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,620
blah I am going to do blah do you want

00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,660
to do that or if you do if you don't

00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,790
want to do blah I will be fine about

00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,440
that you know to make to create

00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,140
permission to do it so there's this sort

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,270
of sense of being really checking your

00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,700
response by asking questions check your

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:15,610
assumptions we get clarity before

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,990
responding make statements about what

00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,250
you're hearing and seeing perhaps

00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,650
they're different things perhaps you're

00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,040
getting a responsive I'm fine well

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,620
they're not fine

00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,560
so you say I hear you you're saying

00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:30,350
you're fine but I'm seeing you react and

00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,940
roll your eyes and shake your you know

00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,710
shake your head and which suggests to me

00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,000
you're not fine so it's being really

00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,230
clear about what you're hearing and what

00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,870
you're seeing if you feel as a

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,510
disconnect and then there's predicting

00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,820
the consequences thing again I'm only

00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,710
new to it but it's really it's really

00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,770
useful and Valerie talked about

00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:51,350
surrender well part of the other pndc

00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,900
literature talks about different kinds

00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:56,660
of defensive response and surrender

00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,830
surrender betray and surrender attack

00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:03,460
are different kinds of responses there

00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:07,400
and surrender surrender just lay down

00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:09,440
yep and there are I think there's a for

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,110
others and there's a natural attack

00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,580
there are a whole range of defensive

00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,830
responses which are really normal and

00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,540
just coated in language and ways of kind

00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,090
of checking nose and responding

00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:24,380
differently to get a better outcome and

00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:25,880
this one is on disk on DEFCON insults

00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,380
girl for conversations I think this

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,950
one's going to be particularly useful in

00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,840
our issue queues it's kind of um a talk

00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,690
by Jenna likens from red hat at Apache

00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,580
con just like a few weeks ago her talk

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,430
was called how to thoroughly insult and

00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,680
defend people in open source and when I

00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,450
saw some tweets about it I thought hey

00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,370
that really i think that dovetails in

00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:49,910
quite nicely with what I've been trying

00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:53,270
to do and she has this um five scale so

00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:56,510
the first one is someone basically posts

00:52:53,270 --> 00:53:00,710
a bug report and says so here here's a

00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:03,050
problem I found in widget 5 it's not

00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,690
quite working and his patch that kind of

00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:09,080
fixes it and so the maintainer of widget

00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:11,450
5 goes ha looks at the patch goes great

00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,850
thanks hola I'll commit that in next

00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:18,380
week's release well good that's green

00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:22,400
that's disk on one just gone to is his

00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:24,080
patch ha thanks for the patch hmm I see

00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,360
some problems here I don't think this

00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,450
quite works with the way we're doing

00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,540
things so I think this needs to go back

00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:34,380
to needs work that's too that's blue

00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,970
it's not too bad

00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,130
it's nothing really wrong with that

00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,690
response is useful there's a bit of

00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,250
there might be a bit more could be a bit

00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,230
more useful with some feedback on how to

00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,630
make it better all but the roadmap is

00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,700
and how it should align but this is all

00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:51,230
good so far then there's three which is

00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:54,420
ha his patch ha thanks for the patch I

00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:57,030
think this coding is kind of stupid I'll

00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,740
take a look at it and consider maybe you

00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:03,000
know what we could do with it it's like

00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:06,960
hmm it's not a super useful response but

00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,970
it could be worse and that is hmm thanks

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
to the patch I think you're really

00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,380
stupid to really want to do this or take

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,600
this approach it's a personal attack

00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,180
there rather than attacking the code

00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,800
it's tacky the person but hey we can

00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,320
take it to a whole other level which is

00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,680
disc on 5 which is going to fire engine

00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:29,550
red and that is huh thanks for the patch

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,830
you stupid idiot for trying to do this

00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:34,880
and I really rather wish you hadn't you

00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:37,860
should perhaps go and die in a fire

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,170
bringing some kind of actually violent

00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,580
at you no threat involved in there may

00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,710
not have been a serious threat it may

00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:47,840
have not meant seriously but it's sort

00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:50,400
of sorry stick your head in a microwave

00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:54,300
yes is another example another one I

00:54:50,400 --> 00:55:00,480
heard was um die in a particularly

00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:02,010
unusual gardening incident so yeah this

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,810
is what we kind of want to avoid but I

00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,730
wonder if it's useful to kind of have

00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,960
this kind of five point scale handy when

00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,180
i'm saying when we're looking through

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,460
responses in issue queues and wondering

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,860
why things are escalating to ah so well

00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:17,240
maybe people are using language which

00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:19,200
sets people you know up to feel attacked

00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,060
if someone's using that kind of language

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,220
if someone calls you stupid if someone

00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,810
calls your code stupid someone then

00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,940
suggest you should stick your head in

00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,380
microwave data fire or an awkward

00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,210
gardening accident thing you're probably

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,340
not going to respond with hahaha that's

00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,630
so funny some people do and I think

00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,250
that's part of the challenge your

00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,350
community that there's an assumption

00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,260
that it's a joke for some people it's

00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,150
really confronting and hurtful I've gone

00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,880
off on a tangent but I'm close to the

00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,620
end now and that is ultimately you know

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,059
we need to work together to avoid

00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,739
stagnation and

00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,599
wasted effort and making people feel bad

00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:54,140
like it's just not really good use of

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,999
anyone's time we need to embrace

00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:00,479
conflict constructively it's fine to

00:55:56,999 --> 00:56:03,959
disagree but rather than tear me down in

00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:07,739
that disagreement can we build something

00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:10,380
together I want us to build a culture of

00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,569
respect where bystanders are empowered

00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,670
to help and Lynette was at the community

00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:16,529
summit on Monday and you know that was

00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,569
to me that that was the culmination of

00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:20,489
this talk it's like hey if you're doing

00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:23,189
more of this stuff where do I find out

00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:25,799
about it how do I get involved bring it

00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:27,390
on thank you so much you know where

00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,219
bystanders are empowered to help where

00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,680
it's okay to challenge an idea to help

00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,689
make it better that's what I'd like to

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,189
see happen oh that's what I'd invite you

00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:37,880
all to help us you know that we could

00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:40,709
build together I really like this quote

00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:44,069
whenever to good people argue over

00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:45,779
principles they're both right and this I

00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:48,150
think happens a lot in our community as

00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:49,739
we work with our project we bring

00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,660
different ideas to the table there's

00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:54,150
nothing wrong with those ideas but we

00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,489
need to perhaps compromise to work

00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,289
together to get the best solution going

00:56:56,489 --> 00:57:00,390
forward and it doesn't necessarily even

00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:03,869
have to be the best most right solution

00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:08,429
but it's one we agree on is useful then

00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:11,699
we can move forward mari Edna von

00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:16,920
Eschenbach so ultimately we have you

00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:21,630
know less of this lots of you know holes

00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,910
blown in walls destruction and more you

00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,799
know happy sunflowers and fields of

00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,569
flowers that make us all smile right I

00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:30,410
just love this because whenever I put up

00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:32,910
the slide like this everyone goes smiles

00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:36,479
that's what I'd like to see that we can

00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:38,420
take on board that challenge and

00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:42,569
conflict is actually a useful thing and

00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:44,969
and move forward and that my friends is

00:57:42,569 --> 00:57:47,219
my treatise on constructive conflict

00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:51,299
resolution and I ask for constructive

00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:52,559
feedback at the end the you can find it

00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:55,349
through the session scheduled or the

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:58,619
shortcut is go to node 2 19 please if

00:57:55,349 --> 00:58:01,590
you've taken an hour to be with me now

00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:05,310
to hear about that then I'd really love

00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:06,960
your your responses in the feedback some

00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,280
scores are good and comments are great

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,950
and if you want to continue this

00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:15,450
conversation with me even better as I

00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:16,860
said at the front I'm cata crab and I

00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,080
can't get back to the front really

00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:22,460
quickly and easily which is actually has

00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:26,340
that in case it's hard to spell and

00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:29,010
there we go yes alright cool um we're

00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:31,110
right on six so I'm quite happy to take

00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,970
questions but it's also home time so if

00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,790
