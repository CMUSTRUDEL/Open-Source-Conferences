Marketing strategies that focus on leads are only addressing one aspect of successful positioning for companies promoting and using open source software. In this introductory session we will look at marketing best practices specifically for businesses that are creating, customizing, and contributing to open source software for their clients. Topics covered will include:

Personas and Stakeholders: beyond just the buyer.
Community and Narrative: the stories we tell are important.
Data: what to measure and when.

effective that we're coming from also

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,629
some good things to know about me is I

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,649
came into marketing by way of writing so

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,929
everything that I'm gonna be talking

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,540
about definitely has kind of a content

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,880
spin on it obviously marketing is a huge

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,460
huge topic and there's a lot of

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,109
different ways to do strategy but I'm

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,990
going to be focusing a lot on content

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,760
creation and how those strategies can

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,349
inform that just my own personal bias

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,109
with that in mind here's a few things to

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,079
know I'm still learning like both as a

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,610
Content marketer and as a human so it is

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,860
my intention to like use your time

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,660
really well to present everything but I

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,739
am still learning and everything I'm

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,690
presenting to you is stuff that I'm

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,469
actively like thinking about that's

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,469
still changing and as a human I'm always

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,390
trying to be respectful and informative

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,760
and if I make any missteps know that

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,680
that is never my intention I don't want

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,539
this to be a positive experience for all

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,719
of us

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,180
I there's a couple different ways to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,890
approach this um so that you guys might

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,420
be wanting to learn about marketing

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,490
strategies because you've made an or

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,740
open-source product and now you need to

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,850
market it or you might be similar to us

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,619
and that you are marketing your

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,750
expertise you know you are doing

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,060
consulting or you're building things

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,280
using open source software and those

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,390
inform very different strategies so

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,549
we're gonna talk about them from both

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,950
perspectives and I'll tell you more

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,930
about how we handle that but obviously

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,460
there's differences and I want it to be

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,549
useful to you no matter where you're

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,439
coming from I always welcome questions

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,610
even when I don't know the answers I

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,009
hope that this will be a really positive

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,049
discussion there's a time for questions

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,810
at the end but if you just like really

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,070
can't handle it and you must ask feel

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,590
free to indicate that to me in some way

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,990
so how do you sell something that's free

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:56,040
you don't that's the end of my session I

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,170
hope you guys had a good time obviously

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,610
you know when you're approaching

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,869
marketing from an open source

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,060
perspective you're not going to be

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,740
selling the thing right you're selling

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,119
knowledge you're selling ideas you're

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,860
selling inspiration and a lot of

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,390
different ways so everything we're

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,590
talking about will relate to that but

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,569
that's just kind of where we're coming

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,650
from and it's a question I get asked the

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:18,269
most often

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,709
in other fields all right so there's

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:21,030
different kind of companies right which

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,610
I already talked about there's companies

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,349
that might be promoting an open-source

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,760
project and those goals are going to be

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:31,470
very different from a company that's

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,909
promoting theirselves as services and so

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,349
the goals for a company that has created

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,939
an open-source project you've solved a

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,250
problem you've created a piece of

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,780
software it's really helpful and you

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,189
want to get the word out about it your

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,470
goals are usually going to be to

00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,000
increase contribution and adoption right

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,400
you want people to use it you want

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,870
people to improve it your audience is

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,180
going to be a lot of peers people who

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,250
know similar things to you are on a same

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,870
level of knowledge or you know within a

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,040
couple of standard deviations of that

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,349
and your content is going to be yeah

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,260
sometimes marketing in these phases can

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:07,319
be seen as inauthentic or unnecessary

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,620
which I think as a marketer is a mistake

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,329
right but if you're a company that's

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,370
promoting your services or you're using

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,959
open-source to build things your

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,730
audience is gonna be different your

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,739
audience is gonna be both technical and

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,690
non-technical people it might be c-level

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,760
executives and your goals are going to

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,769
be to increase your client base increase

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,970
your sales more of a kind of standard

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,060
idea of what we think of as like

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,949
marketing it's easy in that case to

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,510
adopt a philosophy that more content is

00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,699
always better to just be putting out

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,579
stuff to be on every platform but that's

00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,019
often not the case and then there's

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,250
companies that are doing both which is

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,620
the case of amazing labs

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,810
an amazing oh we're both people who like

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,699
create and maintain open source software

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,199
and were people who consult and have

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,129
clients and we build things for them

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,629
using open source software you can marry

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,030
these two strategies even though they

00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,829
kind of have different goals the key to

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,079
that I believe is to identify places

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,019
where they overlap and to maintain a

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,430
balance but the key about maintaining a

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,349
balance is to know when you're doing

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,819
which one right to not try and think

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,049
that you can create a piece of content

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,579
that is going to achieve all the

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,299
different goals but it is ok to switch

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,500
between them as long as you know that if

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,269
you're marketing for an open-source

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,400
project if you've made something that

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,380
you want to do the three key things to

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,139
get started or is to make contribution

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,860
very easy to create useful content and

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,860
to ask for help

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,830
when you're making something that you

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,690
want people to adopt or contribute to

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,210
that you need to really focus on your

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,100
documentation there's this idea that

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,450
like if you build it they will come like

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,760
if you've created an awesome solution

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,110
people will know and they'll just come

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,440
and help you with it that's not

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,730
necessarily the case documentation can

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,020
sometimes take a backseat when you're

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,510
developing and you're in the mode of

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,330
like just going and going but it does

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,070
really affect how people use things what

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,110
questions they ask how much onboarding

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,910
you have to do and all of those things

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,280
are made easier by documentation it also

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,740
can really protect the perception of

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,000
what you've created you know if you've

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,250
made the best thing and your

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
documentation isn't up to par people

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,479
might not know that it's the best thing

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,950
contribution guides are also something

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,780
that can be really important even when

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,310
people have the skill set that you need

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,450
and can really give you a lot of

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,970
knowledge they might not necessarily

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,130
know how to give it to you they might

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,590
not know what's priority they might not

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,120
know what areas can be expanded on and

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,250
if you make that information available

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,550
to them if you make first-time

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,310
contributions really easy and focused

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,560
after that then people will be able to

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,210
contribute a lot more and then there's

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,640
also the rule of three this is not just

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,990
obviously in this case but in general if

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,900
you've answered a question three times

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,460
that means you need content around it so

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,410
if people are always asking how do you

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,050
do this or is there a bug fix for this

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,240
then like you need to address it that

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,770
saves you time and also serve as marking

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,970
purpose you can see that's where like

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:05,240
your business strategy and your

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:08,060
marketing strategy can really align all

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,350
right creating useful content a lot of

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,789
people think like when you think of

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,500
creating content it can seem really

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,090
overwhelming you might think that it

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,070
needs to be a really slick that it needs

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,400
to be super awesome all the time and

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,840
that's just not the case

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,520
creating content should stem from things

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,320
that you're already doing right if

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
you're giving a talk if you're doing a

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,139
training if you're just having a

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,090
conversation if you're onboarding

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,400
someone those are all useful pieces of

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,130
knowledge that you easily be transformed

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,390
into content and in the case of open

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,370
source stuff there is really an

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,870
atmosphere that people want things to be

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,760
authentic in

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,530
if your marketing materials are super

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,750
super slick there can almost be a

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,190
distrust of it right like that thing

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,830
might not have the chops it might not

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,960
have the technical things and that's

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,000
really powerful because even if you're

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,979
working in a very small environment you

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,900
can embrace that transparency and bring

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,060
the transparency into your marketing

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,550
strategy it can be like this is us

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,080
sitting around having coffee talking

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,419
about the next release like that's

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,130
content that can be useful and already

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:11,960
exists and then ask for help

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,729
investing in the community obviously you

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,200
guys are all here at Drupal fun so I

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,360
feel like a little bit I'm preaching to

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,550
the choir but it's important to go to

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,580
events to speak at people to speak at

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,990
events offer trainings this promotes

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,210
your product but also shows your

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,919
investment and it gives time for that

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,680
like cross-pollination not just with

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,110
other developers but with designers with

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,310
marketers being at this meeting for

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,120
example you can seek out skillsets and

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,690
remember to work on other people's

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,889
projects - there's this idea that like

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,570
just because something is mutually

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,880
beneficial doesn't mean that it's like

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,310
icky or salesy right if you can find a

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,470
way to use somebody's technology if you

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,539
can find a way to offer contributions or

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,849
offer promotions to them like that helps

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,650
everybody and it's always important to

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,970
remember to give back I'm really excited

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,710
that you're prod is also offering

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,349
contributions for like marketing and

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,090
content now documentation and stuff like

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,950
that so that like more people can kind

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,419
of be involved with that

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,770
including me you can do a better job of

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,150
improving the world if people know what

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,510
you're doing like you've got a great

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,010
thing let's tell people about it on the

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,960
other hand there's companies that might

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,669
be like agencies or something else where

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,860
you're using open-source software but

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,780
you are selling a service you do need

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,020
client materials it's gonna involve a

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,370
different strategy and in that case you

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,729
need to kind of go back to the basics

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,380
like b2b business to business marketing

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,419
market research is important but on all

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,310
of these things I've focused here on how

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,229
you can do this like right now like you

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,729
can leave this room all of these things

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,400
can sound like something that you need

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,380
really high-level experts for and they

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,730
can like you can definitely use those

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,350
but you can also just do it on your own

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,670
market research is understanding your

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,010
industry and where you fit in it

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,750
identifying your competitors this can be

00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,250
a really detailed report or you can go

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,660
look at somebody's website or Twitter

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,339
feed and kind of see what they're doing

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,310
and see how it compares to what you're

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,290
doing it can be relatively simple same

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,149
with client personas you probably

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,350
already have a lot of data about the

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,970
kind of people that you've worked with

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,100
you know like you have general

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,660
impressions them you have developers or

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,820
project managers who've worked with them

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,769
you can start gathering that data with

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,660
very little effort and just kind of

00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,220
drawing some conclusions from it then

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,380
you can take the next steps doing

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,690
surveys like creating personas there's

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,639
also you can also use personas that have

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,160
been created by other people if they're

00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,269
like relevant to your things you don't

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
have to reinvent the wheel

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:40,320
you can go back and kind of see what's

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,449
useful there so you need to be creating

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
targeted content when I was talking

00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:48,149
about the like more as more kind of idea

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,980
when you identify that your niche and

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,360
your specialization there is definitely

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,380
something that your company is doing

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,810
that is different from how other

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,370
companies are doing that and one thing

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,040
that's great about that is that it

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,870
informs every part of marketing if you

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,100
know exactly what you're doing then you

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,019
probably know who you should be talking

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,750
to and then you probably know what

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,670
platforms you should be bringing it to

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,649
so those are very similar like it might

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,060
seem like you're narrowing things but

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,500
actually the more narrowed is the more

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,990
that you can get content in front of

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,490
people who are looking for it and people

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,170
who are looking for you for your

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:25,500
products but what if you're doing it

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,600
both at once as we are you can focus on

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,970
shared values you're always going to be

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,500
promoting your expertise whether you're

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,699
talking about a new module that you've

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,829
made or whether you're talking about

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,540
consulting for somebody you need to show

00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:38,250
that you're an expert in that space

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,050
and you're always focused on that

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,750
transparency that kind of collaborative

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,750
effort you can use those materials to

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,300
tie to both of those things and the

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,680
overall strategy even though the way

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,029
that is the strategy is gonna play out

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
even though it's going to look different

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,630
I mean what both of them in both cases

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,800
you're doing the same thing you're

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,420
trying to get someone to pay attention

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,010
to you you're trying to keep their

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,949
attention and then you're trying to earn

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,390
their attention right the devil of

00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,270
course is always in the implement

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,280
but when you combine these like values

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,990
with the individual strategies you're

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,020
gonna know exactly what content to

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,100
create and where to put it with smaller

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,100
learning curve than you might think

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,390
align your strategy with your goals and

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,710
then measure everything analytics is

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,200
something that can be really

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,110
overwhelming but all marketing should be

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,940
data based and with that in mind here's

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,870
some very simple things that you can do

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,250
right now even without being an expert

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,320
maximizing your SEO is still one of the

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,140
best strategies for business-to-business

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,550
marketing you can make small changes

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,650
that make a big difference these things

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,390
also change sometimes there can be

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,550
different things but the like the old

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,010
tried-and-true methods that you can like

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:54,000
find very easily they still work right

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,910
like backlinks content keywords you can

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,010
read like a BuzzFeed article on like 5

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,570
things to do improve your SEO and you

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,910
can make a world of difference just with

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,190
the very simple things in social media

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,110
the general idea engagement is more than

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,880
reach there was a lot of focus like kind

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,650
of early on early adoption that people

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,900
are like we just need more people we

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,520
need far other things but actually who's

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,560
paying attention to your stuff is more

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,900
important going to a smaller group of

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,700
people who are more targeted might be a

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,620
better decision than like a bigger group

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,220
of people most of whom are not

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,570
interested in what you're saying another

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,280
started to that you can implement really

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,020
quickly is to boost things that are

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,270
already successful so instead of trying

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,410
to guess and forecast what content that

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,000
you have that people are going to be

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,040
really interested in look at what

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,750
they're already interested in put some

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,990
money there and spread that around a

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,110
little bit Google Analytics that you can

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,720
do so much with it but you can also just

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,330
start very simply make some very simple

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
traffic segmentation find out where

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,230
people are coming from like that's going

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,150
to inform a lot of your strategy one of

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,190
the biggest things about data is if you

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,020
dive into data without knowing what your

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,370
goals are you're gonna get lost so

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,590
quickly because there's so much

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,030
information but if you know your goals

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,890
and you know who you're trying to reach

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,480
and what you need to say to them then

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,580
you can start collecting data that is

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,380
relevant to that and you can start it at

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,780
a very simple level and increase the

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,930
complexity as you grow as you get help

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,640
you kind of get more specialized

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,560
optimization there's a lot of free a be

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,290
test things you can use on newsletters

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,470
press releases even like design things

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,820
can make a big difference the overall

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,790
takeaway is that I would just like you

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,830
to know that you can do things right now

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,020
that you don't have to like have a lot

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,090
of expertise or a lot of tools you can

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,730
use all these things right now but the

00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,530
strategy is where everything needs to

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,080
come from because other than that you're

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,660
kind of just like seeing what sticks

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,750
that said if you do need some experts

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,850
may I just plug another amazing company

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,990
that specializes in just that and

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,950
there's a lot of companies of course

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,810
they can do things like that I know I

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,920
moved to do that fairly quickly and we

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,930
have a short amount of time but I would

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:10,680
love to hear from you guys what you're

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,680
thinking about and what you want it out

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,549
we can just all stare at this cute dog

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:30,739
perfectly acceptable for the end of the

00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:40,160
day yeah no no no I'll repeat it so

00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:41,929
everyone can hear absolutely

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,249
thank you for a sir yes as a developer

00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,959
is there something she can do to help

00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,509
inform these marketing strategies and

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,939
yes of course so like in a position like

00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:51,319
I'm in marketing person but not

00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,819
necessarily annoying so I might have a

00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:55,160
good idea what content needs to be

00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:56,389
created but you have an insight like the

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,459
thing we're talking about like the three

00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,649
questions you might know what those

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:02,480
questions are a lot more than I do so

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,399
you mean it might be like you guys are

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,559
pushing this guide but this guy doesn't

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,230
say this and so people keep coming to me

00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,179
asking this you're also going to know

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,799
like what's a question I like to ask

00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,569
developers is like what's innovative

00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,040
about this but we might be talking about

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,779
a module and a patch release or a

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,689
feature or something but you're going to

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,360
know a lot better than I do why this is

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:25,549
different why it's important and if you

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,259
can share with that with your marketing

00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,119
team or even put it out there yourself

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,730
into the world then that can really

00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:34,689
inform the marketing strategy does that

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,689
answer your question okay

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:59,759
yeah right yeah yeah and and I've heard

00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,870
the same thing so we're kind of in the

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,480
same boat where LinkedIn is really

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,149
taking off a lot more than at least I

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,029
anticipated as a Content platform and

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,199
can be super specific there's just so

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,149
many people on Facebook that I

00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,889
understand why people still think that

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,110
it's like important to put stuff out

00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,060
there one thing that's been kind of

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,439
interesting and some of the things I've

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,810
been reading about marketing is Facebook

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,060
groups because that's already audience

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,949
segmentation right so like just posting

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,420
on your Facebook page people only people

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:29,699
who've liked it can see it and there's

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,500
some algorithms to overdo but if you

00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:33,600
have like a group that's like Drupal

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,220
developers working on this like that

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,660
might be a super good place and you have

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,670
to respect the rules and respected

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,470
community but if they're already

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,439
segmenting themselves then that can be

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,730
advantageous but overall I think I agree

00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:51,540
with you that LinkedIn is probably

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:56,189
scarier yeah the sorry which marketing

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,519
goals yeah so that's one of the one of

00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:02,790
the biggest questions and stuff and

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,770
we're we're still doing it in the kind

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,020
of traditional way so we do web traffic

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,740
traffic segmentation social media

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,630
reports and stuff like that finding out

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,919
which metrics are the best like we've

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,990
been focused a little bit more like I

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,939
talked about on engagement metrics than

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,559
just pure reach so not just how many

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,959
people saw it but how many people shared

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,209
it commented on it and stuff like that

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,069
so there can be a little focus in there

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,720
but we're using pretty much they like

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,010
recommended for example if you wanted to

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,010
go in and like kind of start your own

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,480
thing if you take like the boilerplate

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,429
like kind of stats from Google Analytics

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,140
or one of those other reports there's

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,470
only a few things that you need to add

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,870
or tweak to there to make it useful

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:46,470
which you can yeah

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,510
we are sure yeah so I can't I can't

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,279
speak to that as much as someone else at

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,130
my company probably could even people in

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:57,210
this room but it definitely affects

00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:00,440
things we have always been pretty

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,850
careful about it before during and after

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,770
but things like newsletter lists and

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,799
stuff which just gets more specific but

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,720
well that can be seen as sort of as a

00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,210
weakness like because we don't have like

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,860
all this data that we've been I think it

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,929
can still be used as a strength because

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,340
then you get more opt-ins right like you

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,860
know that the people who are signing up

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,750
for this newsletter want that content

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,640
and that can give you the opportunity

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,169
for super focused marketing right if

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,760
they came to you asking for a webinar

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,289
you can give them more stuff about

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,669
webinars they came to you asking for

00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:35,090
this article then you can give them more

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,090
stuff like that so answer your question

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:42,870
these are great questions we still have

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:44,760
one whole minute I hope that there's

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:55,640
like some sort of award or pin we get

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:55,640
for being on time very small agency

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,590
yes and that's a great question and

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,029
that's one of the things that I wanted

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,279
to encourage you

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,169
so start creating content that you

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,360
already have like we talked about coffee

00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:15,020
chats lunch chats if you do a session

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,640
you know if you even attend a session

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,890
making some posts about that like this

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,630
is what it means to me reacting to stuff

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,190
like that it does take a little bit of

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,350
time but probably not as much time as

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,179
you think but just make sure and do that

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,490
work because like all that stuff we

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,990
talked about like imagining personas and

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,059
doing the market research like I said

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,890
you can get an expert to do that but you

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,230
know like you know your company you know

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,779
your clients it's worth drafting like a

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,029
small Google Doc being like who are our

00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,950
clients right now what kind of clients

00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,750
do we want and even just that bit of

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,640
guidance once you get that it's like we

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,110
want this kind of client oh then we

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,760
should probably make a document that

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,140
speaks to that kind of client and you

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,630
can just make decisions like that that

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,100
will go a long way so just make sure you

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,460
just avoid like feeling like you just

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,290
have to

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,300
produce stuff all the time or put it

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,070
everywhere because making a small

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,610
focused effort you can make a lot of

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,310
things happen like that that makes it

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:10,590
okay alright well thank you guys all for

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,360
coming at the end of the day I

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,050
appreciate you and I hope you have a

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:23,479
great rest of your dribble Collin

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:23,479
