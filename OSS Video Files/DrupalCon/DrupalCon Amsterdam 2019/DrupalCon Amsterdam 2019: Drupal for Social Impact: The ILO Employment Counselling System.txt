The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in consultation with the Ministry of Labour of the Kingdom of Jordan launched the first on-line job counselling and guidance platform to target Syrian workers in Jordan. It is co-funded by the European Union, The US Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The Drupal based platform is available both in arabic and english and integrates web, mobile and telephone services, making the new system easily accessible to workers, reaching out to a greater number of people.

Any Jordanian worker with a valid national ID number, and Syrian workers with Ministry of Interior cards can register on the platform using different channels. Either individually, or with the support of a career counselor, job seekers can complete their profiles, upload CVs and any relevant qualifications to support matching with relevant training and job opportunities. Employers and training providers can upload job vacancies, training and internship opportunities and receive applications from interested and qualified job seekers.

The main functionalities are:
- A Solr based job matching system
- Integration with voice service providex by an Asterisk based digital PBX
- Integration with an android app used by field operators in the refugees camp to enrol people without internet connection on the platform
- API for integration with third party employment services from NGOs, other UN agencies, goverment systems, external job boards, etc.
