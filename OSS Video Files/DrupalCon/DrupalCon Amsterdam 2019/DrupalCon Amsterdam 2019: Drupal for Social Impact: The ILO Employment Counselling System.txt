Everis, Zaragoza, Spain

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in consultation with the Ministry of Labour of the Kingdom of Jordan launched the first on-line job counselling and guidance platform to target Syrian workers in Jordan. It is co-funded by the European Union, The US Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The Drupal based platform is available both in arabic and english and integrates web, mobile and telephone services, making the new system easily accessible to workers, reaching out to a greater number of people.

Any Jordanian worker with a valid national ID number, and Syrian workers with Ministry of Interior cards can register on the platform using different channels. Either individually, or with the support of a career counselor, job seekers can complete their profiles, upload CVs and any relevant qualifications to support matching with relevant training and job opportunities. Employers and training providers can upload job vacancies, training and internship opportunities and receive applications from interested and qualified job seekers.

The main functionalities are:
- A Solr based job matching system
- Integration with voice service providex by an Asterisk based digital PBX
- Integration with an android app used by field operators in the refugees camp to enrol people without internet connection on the platform
- API for integration with third party employment services from NGOs, other UN agencies, goverment systems, external job boards, etc.

system this is a system that users can

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,010
in which users can register or can't

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:38,020
request for complaints that they can

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,980
have regarding a job offer for example

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:47,020
or also they can request for information

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,960
for to monitor work permits or health

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,960
and accident insurance for example also

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,640
this ticketing system has a workflow so

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,360
that counselors can manage all these

00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,750
requests in addition counselors have a

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,500
space with some data analysis so they

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:09,840
can take better decisions based on this

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,840
information and improve the platform

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,689

okay yeah for finishing this session

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,059
these are some of the key achievements

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,949
of a platform so far I saw I told you

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,449
the platform was launched at the

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:17,610
beginning of this year in generally 2018

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:23,029
we actually have 15 with history of

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:27,199
seekers for tv9 and prior companies and

00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:30,720
2010 range of packin seas and actually

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,700
the 68% of the people that are working

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,009
with the employment service center are

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,820
coming for the platform so it had

00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:41,879
suppose a big boost to the whole service

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,009
because their possibility to interact

00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:47,370
with these people for the heat away

00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:49,200
without having to visit the center's he

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:54,990
is very convenient for most of the other

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:59,240
people on the region that's all thank

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,240
you my turn now your your questions

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,960
do you have local participation did you

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,970
have

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,539
entertaining to Assyrians participators

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,480
sure yeah then in fact the project

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,639
manager of the ILO is a Syrian woman and

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,320
she's in charge of all the crises of the

00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:27,059
Syrian refugees in the in the region and

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,860
we also involve some people from the

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,799
video from several other parts of the

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:35,490
project and especially in the workshops

00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,340
to create all the all the training of

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,399
the people and also for example the

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,360
distribution is hosted in the

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:49,799
maintenance is being keeping by Mary

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:54,440
jordan companies so there is a lot of

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:54,440
involvement of of people from

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,160
just to show you showed everything

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:09,030
Mountain

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:11,250
yeah but I'd assume they work in but

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,220
they just know they are entertained

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,170
information and in fact the main

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,140
language of the platform right now is in

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:26,940
heroic of course we are using in movies

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:31,340
because from what we know yet is the

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,340
same but we are not exposed

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,770
as those fury as I saw that your mobile

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,400
app you have a multi-user creation

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,400
yeah

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,649
yeah we create one of the requirements

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,200
of the period is that the counselors are

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:57,929
coming to the refugees camps with some

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,630
kind of tablet that they create for for

00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:03,600
that purpose so of course they are not

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,240
internet there so we created an Android

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,669
application that keeps all the data on

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,279
the device on the database our local

00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,770
database and then when they came to the

00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,230
office they can launch a sync pro

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,149
failure with ropal and we put the

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,909
information into the platform which is

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,909
on using the API from

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,740
the user

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,680
somebody yeah well you have to take into

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:41,090
account that that there are a lot of

00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:46,290
refugees that don't have internet at all

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:51,420
so yeah but they are they are visiting

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:53,400
the Centers for the information of and

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,880
the coordination of the actions that the

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,610
the counselors performed we said was

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,060
that specific person riding the platform

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,430
so they are managing people even also

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,780
the people itself doesn't have a

00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:13,170
breakfast to the to the platform

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:15,420
sorry just to stir our comment was as

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,770
used as usual well there is there is a

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,660
functionality which is that the

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,970
counselors can act on behalf of the new

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,730
church that's that's the functionality

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,370
that is hospital has been put in place

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,310
just for these cases for the cases in

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,770
which the users don't have access to to

00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,710
the platform oh they don't have internet

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:37,230
so so they can call to the call center

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,900
or on to the call center or visit a

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,480
Counseling Center and consumers can act

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,760
in on behalf of them and apply to

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,720
different job offers or editor profile

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,820
or whatever they need in fact when you

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,250
call the platform you have to be

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:58,710
religious register because I will recall

00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:01,320
the you need a number now once you put

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,990
your numbers and all the actions and all

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,650
the calls are recorded or other things

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,650
