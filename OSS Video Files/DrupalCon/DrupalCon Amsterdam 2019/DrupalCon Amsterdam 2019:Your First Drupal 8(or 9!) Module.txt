Publication date: 2019-10-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Presenter: Ted Bowman
Description: This presentation will start you on your journey into Drupal 8(and 9) module development. It will show you the steps you need to take to make a simple but useful Drupal module. The module will also work on the upcoming Drupal 9.

Topics that will be covered

* The Plugin System
* Providing Blocks as Plugins
* Creating Routes and Menu items
* Creating Forms
* Module Permissions
* Drupal's Hook System (yes it's still there)
* Letting other modules integrate with your module
* Making sure your module works with Drupal 9

We will step through adding functionality to the module from a blank PHP file to the completed module. You will learn how each step works along the way. You will also get access to the source code for each step so you can study it after the session.

To get the most out of this session, you should have some experience with PHP or another programming language, at least a beginner's knowledge of Drupal and a desire to make it your own. Come see how simple it is to add functionality to Drupal.
