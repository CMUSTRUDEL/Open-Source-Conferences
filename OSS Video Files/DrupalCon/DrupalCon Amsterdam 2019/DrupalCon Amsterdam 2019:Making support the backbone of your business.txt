Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019:Making support the backbone of your business
Publication date: 2019-10-30

Presenter: Anthony Lindsay, Stella Power
Description: Is this you?

"Support isn't where we're focused. It's boring. We don't need it. We're pushing the boundaries, building new and innovative projects, reaching for the sky... and our cashflow and sales pipeline sucks."

Well, you might be surprised to learn that:

* Supporting existing clients makes sense.

* It's steady, predictable work.

* It maintains profitable relationships with household names who bolster your brand.


Finding new projects is expensive, whilst retaining current clients provides the financial stability necessary for growth. As support work is predictable, your revenue stream becomes more predictable, allowing you to plan for the future and weather the ups and downs of project work.

Often support seems to play second fiddle to major project work when, in fact, it can actually turn a financially disadvantageous project into a very profitable one. Taking this further, one can develop an entirely new revenue stream based solely on supporting projects that have not even been built by your own agency.

We'll talk about how you can, and should, put a serious focus on support in all its guises, from maintenance tasks, to ongoing development and continuous delivery, and all the way to emergency disaster recovery.

We'll explore why it is important for your business and how you can grow the service so that it is not merely providing a backup to new project builds, but becoming a primary service itself.

Lastly we'll show that at a human level, it is a rewarding place to be, offering endless opportunities for continuous professional and personal development.

Learn About:

* managing multiple projects
* keeping clients happy
* billing
* security updates
* testing
* the business case for repeatable business
* standardisation
* monitoring
* alerts
* maintaining a happy, healthy team

This session is aimed at people running/managing or thinking of starting their own agencies. You may be already working on offering your clients support. You may be looking for another revenue stream for your business. If you're interested in hearing all about making support work for your business, this is the place to be.

good morning everybody thank you all for

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,840
coming this must be like the graveyard

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,260
shift after all of the parties last

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,630
night so we appreciate seeing some bums

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,830
on seats because it will be very lonely

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:27,590
in the big room without you all here so

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,590
we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,820
support providing support as a service

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,079
why we think it's a great idea and

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,950
hopefully have a little bit of fun along

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,510
the way we have the coolest thing that

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,899
I've seen all conference here these are

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,480
microphones so if anybody wants to butt

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,550
in and answer ask a question feel free

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,760
cuz we can throw these on there light

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:03,750
and soft so please do jump in if you

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,040
feel the need and we do reserve the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,310
right to try and keep things moving

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,070
along because we've a fair bit of

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,200
material we'd like to share so we don't

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,680
want to spend too long

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,840
diverting off answering questions but we

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:31,740
will try and facilitate any questions

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:33,810
that come along the way so so I'm Stella

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,850
I'm the managing director of anatec it's

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:42,710
a digital agency based out of Ireland

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,710
and I'm Anthony I lead the support team

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,659
so i don'r tech we love support so that

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,100
might be a bit of a this is the normal

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,450
reaction that we definitely need to say

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,340
that but yeah we do and it's a large

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,759
part of our business to give you a bit

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,880
of a background to it currently we have

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,929
about seven people on the support team

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,990
we have forty clients and over 60 sites

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:17,680
all on our retainer support model

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,990
but I don't know when was it was about

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,460
2013 when to the soul come into being

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,190
when do we realize the support was

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,200
really important to our business in 2013

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,510
at Rubicon pride we won a large project

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,130
at the time there was only six people in

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,290
the company and it is one of those

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,800
projects that was either don't just sink

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,350
us or grow us it was like all or nothing

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,280
so it was like we have lots of existing

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:44,590
clients they're quite needy but needy in

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,880
a good way because we love them yes yes

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,400
in a good way so is what do we do so we

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,620
put five at the company on the new

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,940
project and we gave Anthony everybody

00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,570
else so things have kind of grown from

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,450
there as Stella said it's now a team of

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,360
seven and we're still trying to grow the

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,630
team we're airing by the way yeah if

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:17,170
anybody feels the need please do make

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:21,670
yourselves known and yeah we came to the

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:25,660
realization that without providing a

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,370
devoted dedicated support service we

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,070
were just leaving money on the table

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,420
from a purely business point of view

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,440
there's clients there with needs and

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,340
they want your help

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,710
and it's might not be big enough for a

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,140
full-blown project it might not be big

00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,160
enough to go through the whole

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,160
procurement process but it's regular

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,530
incremental to give you an idea of just

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,750
what we're talking about here the

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,330
support team in our business is a third

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,090
of our company and our revenue is over a

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,060
third from the support team alone so

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,920
that's just regular recurring revenue so

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,020
it allows us to have that stable base

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,120
and to go after new clients and new

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:19,210
projects so what are some of the other

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:22,510
benefits well I find that because you're

00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:25,150
in contact with your clients every day

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,370
more or less you're building the

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,580
relationship all the time

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,380
when they actually have a big chunk of

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,479
work they're more likely to come

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:40,210
directly to you so the cost of sale

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,850
drops dramatically if for example

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,330
there's a tender that comes out for a

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,150
big juicy government website it costs a

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,669
lot of money to create the proposal to

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,120
go through the arduous tender process a

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:59,169
lot of time a lot of effort but in the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,910
world of support you're getting business

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:06,520
all the time and when they want a new

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,520
widget they just come to you when they

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,850
want a sharp maybe you have to price

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,120
that but they just come to you and

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:19,240
you're constantly building trust with

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:25,270
the client which just pays dividends all

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,070
the time yeah it really does like okay

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,190
you're coming to you with new projects

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,860
and new bits and pieces but we can also

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,110
go to them we can say we might have a

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,090
lull and say are you acting where we

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,340
need you know we don't have a new enough

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,370
work possibly in our pipeline where we

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,979
forecast that's happening we can go sell

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,440
a client to UX orders and actually drum

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,440
up more work that way and it works

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,340
really well to fill those gaps in the

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,880
main project teams yeah there is lots of

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,010
opportunity and we'll talk about this a

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,200
bit later when we come to talk about

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,979
billing but there's lots of opportunity

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,070
to well make more money out of it

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,380
through that approach of being proactive

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:16,210
and seeing a need that the client has

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:21,810
and then making the case for it so what

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:25,870
do we mean by support well my day to day

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:30,010
could touch 20 projects and it could be

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,889
anything from rescuing a disaster we're

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,530
on more than one occasion people have

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:39,180
deleted user accounts and then seen all

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,180
of their content vanish or

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,800
oh I don't know somebody's deleted a

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,629
database or their server has exploded so

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,020
all of that sort of recovery from

00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:55,490
disaster but it might be I want a

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:58,610
call-to-action button or it might be I'm

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,550
really not sure that I'm using features

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,340
right can we have a chat and you can

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,310
talk me through it it's everything from

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,250
I want a friendly voice at the end of

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:15,020
the phone through to help me I'm about

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:18,110
to die yes so we do provide sort of

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,169
helpdesk support as in how can i edit

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,199
this page or can you edit this page for

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:28,039
me that's actually at the rare end most

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:34,550
of it is we want a new feature or yeah I

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:36,169
deleted all my content help yeah but

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:42,889
then there's some other things there's

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:47,000
um there's many projects yes so again

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:50,750
this this ties in neatly two different

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,050
ways of billing because as a standard we

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,380
like to keep it simple and at the the

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,409
initial phone call where I'm introducing

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,680
people to how we work I like to say

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:04,460
you're just buying time I don't care how

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,990
you use it

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm I've got your back I'm there for you

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:16,129
so if you want chat or you want a widget

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:19,940
that's fine but sometimes particularly

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:23,120
with larger pieces of work clients want

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:27,590
certainty or maybe their their

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:32,000
businesses require certain dates to be

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:36,529
met or certain bags of money not to be

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,430
exceeded so they the client will always

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:43,279
have a desire a desired future state

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,610
they want to be somewhere to get

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,980
somewhere and and they don't want to

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,390
take any of the risk pardon and they

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,709
don't want to take any of the risk

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,480
indeed they don't want to take an

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,500
interest but nor

00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,620
we charge by the hour because it's easy

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:05,810
easy for us easy for them but then there

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:09,680
is more risk so with a mini project so

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:12,980
something maybe 50 to 100 hours so it's

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,399
not big enough for a build team but it's

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:22,610
bigger than might normally do in a month

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:26,990
for one client they can or rather we

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:33,139
have the opportunity to offer them they

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:35,540
can buy a mitigation against risk if

00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,720
that makes sense so if they want

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,449
something by a given date we have to

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,360
ring-fence resources for that that costs

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:48,079
there's value to be had in the certainty

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:53,320
that the project will be delivered by

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:56,510
next Thursday if they want a fixed price

00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,670
there's value in the certainty of that

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:04,399
fixed price and it's more expensive but

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:10,880
people do appreciate the value of that

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:15,380
certainty whereas as easy as paying by

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,380
the hour is it can sometimes make people

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,860
a little nervous when you're talking

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:25,190
about 50 or 100 hours but there's an

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,980
opportunity there for us yeah and often

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,449
we deal with corporations who we're

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,100
dealing with the media team or the IT

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:33,709
team and they're quite happy with the

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,440
buy the error but they've got to present

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:38,209
the case internally to the different

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,279
business units in the organization and

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:44,149
they're not they just want a price and a

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,350
time and that's it so the support team

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,779
does have the agility and the

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,430
flexibility to take on those larger

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,279
pieces of work that are too small for

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,100
the project teams but still larger than

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,680
the normal regular monthly support that

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,750
we would normally give them but then

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,360
there is also planned work and unplanned

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,480
work I'm an emergency work and the

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,769
emergency work so planned work is where

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,920
you would sit down with the client at

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,720
the

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,310
there's the month and you know right

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,899
here's your background what are the

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,779
priorities for this month what he wants

00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,430
to get done we have so many hours let's

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:19,639
do it

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:24,139
where is unplanned where well unplanned

00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:27,010
work is that tends to come after you've

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:31,370
done the planning with the client and

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:35,389
you're going to do a widget on Monday

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:37,790
and then on Thursday we're going to get

00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:41,329
rid of some rubbish that's legacy code

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:46,579
maybe but then Monday afternoon they go

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:49,730
oh I saw a thing on another site can we

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:51,800
have that and then somebody from

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,930
marketing comes on and goes oh actually

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,240
no I want this thing too

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,550
so they've all got these conflicting

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,760
priorities now and it's important to be

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:05,449
able to push back to the client to go

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,029
which do you want first which sure we

00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:10,970
can do these but I won't have this done

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,699
for a Thursday if you want these other

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,560
things so that's unplanned work and then

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:22,630
emergency work is help I've deleted

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,610
something or payments aren't working or

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,860
or there's a basa tacking area site yeah

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,920
yeah yeah we're seeing a lot of BOTS

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,140
attacking sites lately it's also to

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,959
degree would be security updates there

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,370
somewhat planned as in you know and a

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,899
Wednesday evening there's possibly

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,220
security updates coming out and

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,949
sometimes there's a public service

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,269
announcement but you know it's it's

00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:47,089
still something that you have to

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:49,250
schedule in you can reserve time for it

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:54,199
but it's something that has to be done

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:56,990
but may not happen actually so it's it

00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:04,870
can be fun to try and manage all of

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:09,050
these disparate pressures I suppose and

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:13,220
the way we tend to do it is through a

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:15,890
combination of Trello for the nice

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:20,769
visual interface we use a Trello board

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:25,920
per client and we use a slack

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:28,779
and called rocket that takes

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,329
notifications from each Trello board so

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:34,420
any new card that's created any new

00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:36,910
comment that's created it goes through

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,389
the flow of communication that we use

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:45,730
every day so we're able to stay on top

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:51,420
of what's happening and we recently

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:55,980
introduced the concept of a sweeper role

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,720
because if everybody is looking at

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,329
rocket chair all the time looking at all

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,959
of these notifications you're constantly

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:08,259
being bombarded with information and

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:12,910
your context switching all the time so

00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:18,129
we decided to have a rotor I suppose one

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:22,329
person every week their job is to stay

00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:26,170
on top of rocket and to look after new

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,610
cards leaving everybody else to look

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:32,459
after all of the stuff they're already

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:35,649
doing and that has been a huge success

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:39,149
because if it's not your turn you can

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:41,589
just ignore all of the new cards until

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,629
somebody brings something specifically

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,259
to your attention because it's your

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,069
skillset

00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,439
or your favorite client or they're stuck

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:52,360
and they need your help so it's simply

00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:54,279
about minimizing distractions and

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,049
allowing work to get completed rather

00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,549
than a whole bunch of different tickets

00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,329
being started and none of them actually

00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:03,459
getting across the line and it's it's a

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,809
new concept for us it's something we've

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,629
only been trying out in the last few

00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:10,119
weeks months yeah but it appears to be

00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:14,110
working so far similarly we've bans the

00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:15,759
AK here in rocket and slack so we're

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,790
minimizing the number of distractions of

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:23,589
just little queries that pop up another

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:29,879
thing that we introduced really or

00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:32,259
recently this is this is less about

00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,750
minimizing context switching and

00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:37,840
distraction but it segues nicely

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,050
we set up a private channel just for my

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,860
team called the bat-signal and that's

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,930
when you are working on a ticket and

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,350
you're just stuck you don't know where

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,450
to go so if you enter something into the

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,530
bat-signal the rest of the team knows

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:58,870
you're stuck and you need their help but

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:06,670
it's only used in emergencies it's not

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:08,680
for only this team in there so that's

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,700
also working really well because you

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,230
know there's a problem

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,770
if anything happens in the bat-signal

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:19,540
channel so in terms of we in terms of

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,350
how we price this and how we build

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,550
clients and how we work with them

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,830
there's three different models that we

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,410
use so we already talked about the mini

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,240
projects and how it's a fixed price

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,970
quite often and it's a fixed time and

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,630
they paid the the extra cost to get that

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,480
fixed price we're taking on the risk so

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,840
the cost is higher and most of the time

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,170
we make profit sometimes though there is

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,420
a risk that you don't but then there's

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,920
the kind who just wants insurance who

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,230
just wants somebody there at the other

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,820
end of the phone or the other end of the

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,760
ticket system or the other end of the

00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,430
email just to be there and answer

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,020
questions they may not contact you but

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:07,900
they may and they see the value in that

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:10,390
insurance and having somebody there and

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:15,040
then there's some of the other bars

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,839
that's a question I was wondering how

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,250
much extra do we charge for the

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:25,720
mitigating risk percentages it kind of

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,790
depends on the project but yeah it could

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,830
be we do the estimate and then double

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,460
its if we think there's a high volume of

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:37,300
risk or we add on 20% it depends on the

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,660
project is - how much of the scope we

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,340
are competent in and also our history

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,990
with that clients in terms of how often

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,110
they change the scope or what - change

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,659
the stroke however yeah

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,039
then there is subscription so most of

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:56,029
our coins will be in a subscription

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:59,659
module model so we have set packages

00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:02,090
bronze silver gold and so on where you

00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,820
get so many hours per month at the very

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,279
basic level you just add support there's

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,750
no code no anything you just have

00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,140
somebody at the ends of the line who can

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,049
help you at the other ones well I just

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,929
like to say that with the basics

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:20,240
you're meant to just get support and no

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:24,590
development but sometimes we sneak some

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,899
in I'm not sure I meant to know that on

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,639
the other packages you do get ongoing

00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:31,909
development and new features and new

00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:33,889
widgets and how much you get depends on

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,330
how much what that little support you've

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:39,169
signed up to you how many hours you've

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:43,549
subscribed to some people really don't

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:45,950
care what the okay want one moment some

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:47,659
people don't care what package they've

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,840
actually signed up to they just don't

00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:54,519
want your time as often as they can get

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,690
it so there are nice clients to have

00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,789
just to continue in that we have some

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,179
kinds who are on 16 hours per month in

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:04,309
are doing 150 if you have first

00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,190
subscription hours what do you do with

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:10,789
hours not used clients are tied to

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,940
rollover hours for a maximum up to a

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:16,700
maximum of their subscription so say you

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,340
have a contract for 16 hours per month

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,740
and they use 10 then they have six that

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:28,159
they can roll over but the maximum they

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:31,269
can roll over is 16 okay again the idea

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,190
there is to keep it simple but

00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,350
continuing on like Sega red nicely from

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,409
that actually is how does the support

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,169
team know how many hours a client has

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:44,809
how much has already been used how much

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:47,570
is left and also whether the trying is

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:50,240
willing to go over their hours I can go

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,549
to the 17 errors or the 25 hours or

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,440
whatever it is beyond their subscription

00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:59,419
so we've used to it used to be easy when

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,370
it was just me doing it all it was easy

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,940
but

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:08,750
now that it's grown basically we've had

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,690
to automate everything that I used to do

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,540
by hand on a spreadsheet so we have

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,050
reports set up that all the team can

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,880
access that shows all the clients how

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,890
many hours they subscribe to how many

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,800
we've done how many are left and

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,290
percentages and color codes and it's a

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,480
thing of beauty I don't know why I

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:35,510
didn't do it years ago because it saves

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:40,430
me so much work so between that and I

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:45,170
have set up a sort of a board of Trello

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:48,590
boards so that you can see every client

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,470
and each column in their Trello boards

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:55,430
and how many cards are in each one so

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,010
it's easy to see if there's cards

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,010
waiting for deployment sometimes they

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:05,840
get forgotten about or cards sitting in

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:08,960
QA that need to be unstuck and need to

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:14,540
get deployed or a nice healthy backlog

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:19,460
so you can quite quickly figure out who

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,590
has work who has hours and get going

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,170
doing stuff helping people yeah and

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,910
seeing what is there to be done and also

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,010
seeing where the bottlenecks are quite

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,880
often the bottleneck is in UAT where the

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:35,150
customer needs to sign off on it but um

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,250
the other thing that often arises is the

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,370
kinds that the they want to know where

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,770
their hours are being spent so similarly

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,630
to how we've built that report or

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,060
dashboard of the different errors and

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:50,000
the time remaining for each client we've

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,800
integrated our time keeping system with

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,930
Drupal so we've been able to create all

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,300
these customer reports and we've created

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:58,910
a customer dashboard so the customers

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,830
can log in and see a dashboard of all

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,200
their hours and they can go back they

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,110
can query last month this month custom

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,150
time period so that's a huge time saver

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,270
as well because you're not constantly

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,910
asked what did you do last week can I

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:18,570
get a timesheet report for last month

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:20,670
it's all there along with and it'll be

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,660
interesting actually to find out whether

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:27,180
clients use this information I've got

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,940
statistics on how many cards get done a

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,000
month and how much effort cards

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:38,790
typically take and I use it all the time

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,380
for forecasting so when clients go how

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,840
long is this gonna take when they've

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,680
just asked for a ticket and I haven't

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,160
even looked at it

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,380
I can go on average it takes two and a

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,290
half hours to do a card so it's gonna

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,870
probably take two and a half hours and

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:57,140
that makes them happy because that's

00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,580
what it's all about keeping them happy

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,440
it doesn't really matter in one way

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:10,710
whether the website works once the

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:14,610
customer is happy right foot rubs I say

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:17,400
that jokingly but in effect foot rubs

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,530
they want to feel loved they want to

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,700
know that you've got your got their back

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:25,650
they want to know that in an emergency

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,820
they can come to you and you'll make

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:32,960
their problems go away that's the core

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,610
of it the core of it is communication

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,010
you have to communicate richer kinds

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,230
communicate readily when a ticket comes

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,860
in you need to respond and say we're

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,210
honest or we'll be you know that's no

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,860
our priority you know

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,630
weirds evil at your other higher

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,890
priority tickets first they just need to

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,970
know that it's been looked at and

00:23:49,890 --> 00:24:00,840
somebody is honest and regular updates

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:03,770
afterwards of course yeah it is it's

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,450
very easy to jump on each new ticket and

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:09,420
respond to the customer and go yes we're

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,580
on it and then forget about that ticket

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,420
because another one has come in yes

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,750
we're on ER and you end up spinning 200

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,110
plates with all of these new tickets and

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,630
that's where the sweeper role we spoke

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,120
about earlier really comes into play

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,690
because the sweeper is doing that

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,399
respond

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:34,200
is doing that initial triage and then

00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:36,169
either completing the ticket or handing

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:42,559
it to someone to get over the line and

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:48,240
it makes completion a lot easier because

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:51,179
until it's complete it's dead work so

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,870
then there's I want to move on to talk

00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:58,620
about standardization that's a good one

00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:02,129
so we have over 60 sites across

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,860
different clients we have projects that

00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:06,240
are on Drupal 7 that we built then we

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,429
changed how we were rebuilding Drupal

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,230
seven sites does Drupal 7 was around

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,059
quite a while so we've got different

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,330
ways of building Drupal 7 sites and now

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,090
we have Drupal 8 and then we also have

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,950
the rescue projects the the projects

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,590
that somebody else built and they Lander

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,480
wants to support or maybe the

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,000
relationship between the vendor and the

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,980
customer broke down and we have to take

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,909
over that and there are a whole world of

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:40,220
special snowflakes so how do you manage

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:44,129
that right so managing all that is hard

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:48,450
so we've got I don't know seven

00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:52,919
different hosting platforms including

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:57,450
some self hosted sites and six different

00:25:52,919 --> 00:26:00,690
VPN solutions and a million different

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,570
code bases and modules and it is a lot

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,539
to get your head around so we try and

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:10,559
standardize as much as possible we have

00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:12,629
a thing that we call housekeeping at the

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,299
start of every support project we

00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:20,210
identify the things that just need to be

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:26,159
done now so getting modules up-to-date

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:30,419
getting say hosting environment

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,090
configuration just so all of that so

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:36,690
that we have access to all of the tools

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,820
that we expect in our daily work so that

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,950
it can make dealing with all of the

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,840
special snowflakes easier

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,660
when we do Tait over somebody else's

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,630
website somebody else's built we do a

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:53,670
site audit so this is a privatized

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:56,650
solution that we've we sell them so we

00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,480
do two three days of reviewing their

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,550
website how it's been constructed what

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,550
modules they're using we do a security

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,040
review we noted all the custom codes all

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,870
the weird configurations and module

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,220
combinations that you're using and we

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,330
produce a report and we've cracked

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,460
classifying the report whether this is

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,770
critical we need to look at this now or

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,540
whether this is low priority it's just

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,060
information for you to know about your

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,560
website and from there we're able to sit

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,850
down with the client discuss with them

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,170
their needs and what they want to

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,150
achieve with the website and also

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,030
discuss what we need to do in terms of

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,190
housekeeping and suggested to a stable

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,860
place that we can continue to support it

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,900
without too much hassle and that creates

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,490
a nice backlog when the customer comes

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,270
on board and then we discuss with them

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,130
priorities and how to move forward the

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,090
difficulties arise when you have a

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:52,120
client who has limited budget per month

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:54,580
but they have a disaster of a website so

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,020
you have a backlog as long as your arm

00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:00,940
of things that really need to be done

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,880
but they also want a new widget and

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,200
maybe this widget maybe that's a payment

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,210
system or something and it's going to

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,210
take multiples of months to get finished

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:17,170
we have learned over the time that it's

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:20,230
really important to prioritize the

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:25,630
remedial work before you get involved in

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:28,090
any complex new stuff because otherwise

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,460
the new stuff just takes longer it's

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:37,210
more full of bugs bugs that you didn't

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:41,040
create yeah yeah you're building work

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:46,900
the problem is that technical debt

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:50,440
arrives in spades on on inherited

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,960
projects legacy code and technical debt

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,660
it's like radioactive waste

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,510
you can measure its half-life in years

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,640
and it doesn't go away unless you bury

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:05,080
it in concrete or burn it with fire

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,570
I like the burning burning is good but

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,750
the client doesn't always see the

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:14,950
benefit because it isn't obvious it's

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:19,030
not a shiny new widget you're digging up

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,850
buried bodies essentially but it is

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:25,360
important to try and communicate and

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,850
educate the client on why this is

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,880
important and what they're get actually

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:35,770
getting and how it will save them time

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:39,610
and money later on it can be a very

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:43,030
difficult line to tread between you have

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:48,820
all these problems and we're gonna fix

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:51,460
them and the last agency sucked you know

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,110
you don't want to bad-mouth anybody but

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,970
essentially you're bad-mouthing them

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,690
just because you're showing all of the

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,100
corpses that they have in their codebase

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,470
so you have to be nice about it

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,210
yeah and afternoon clients do you feel

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,280
quite burned like when they come from

00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,340
another agency where the relationship is

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,990
broken down they're feeling quite burnt

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,540
and by the relationship and they it

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,700
takes time to build that trust up with

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,990
the new kind to show you're not going to

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,430
be the same you're going to communicate

00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,380
you're don't you're actually respond to

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,290
their tickets and you know address their

00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,750
concerns but it is something that we

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,830
have to work through this show them that

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:34,900
they are loved a nice quick win like if

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:38,950
if you want to build trust quicker I

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,740
have found sure maybe there's a load of

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,320
remedial work that needs to be done

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,750
that's God invisible evils that need to

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,360
be solved but if you can do something

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,790
like give them a paragraph that lets

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,290
them embed a YouTube video you know or

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:58,030
give them a new call-to-action button

00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:02,050
something that is shiny and do that

00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:04,600
quickly straight off the bat then they

00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,610
get impressed and they trust you more

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,039
and then you can talk about

00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,140
let's fix a lotus it's something that

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,230
they can show their boss or their CEO

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,909
and you know we've been asking this for

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,549
this for months and we've got it already

00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:21,700
just by simply changing agency you know

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:24,309
it does it does help that relationship

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,470
and bond I'm conscious of time is moving

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:33,070
on and I do want to talk about team so

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:35,230
support isn't for everyone there's a lot

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,539
of context switching involves so you're

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,309
working with kinds like 40 different

00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:42,549
kinds who have anything from four hours

00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:44,529
to 32 to weigh more than 32 hours per

00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,809
month and there is a lot of juggling a

00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,760
lot of different types of tasks

00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:52,299
different projects Drupal 7 Drupal 8

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,610
different hosting environments so yeah

00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:57,700
it's not for everybody and it does

00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,080
require experience you can't just join

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,870
the support team as a junior developer

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,380
because there's just so many different

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,539
combinations it's just yeah you have to

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,320
have experience in order to join the

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,860
team and be able to get into the the

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:20,110
investigation work the detective work

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:22,840
yeah a large part of it is interrogating

00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,350
the client I like to call it badgering

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,630
the witness

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,779
oh we have a question I was just

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:31,059
wondering with the context within how do

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:33,399
you build that into your billing and

00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:36,250
planning because you know sometimes when

00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:39,130
you have to switch you said up to 20

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:42,190
times per one day now that's extreme but

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:44,380
I understand but that's sometimes my job

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:48,070
too but how do you build it into your

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:51,970
building because it sometimes context

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,639
switching can take a while just just to

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,490
go from one and to the next even though

00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:01,090
what you're doing literally took two

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:03,070
minutes we always we always round up to

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:06,480
the nearest 15 minutes so if something

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:11,399
takes two minutes it actually took 15

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,889
but that's sort of built in by design I

00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,470
like to think I'm good at context

00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:19,760
switching I know nobody is really but

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:23,060
you're better than most

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,670
I'm okay at us I know some of my team

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:30,650
aren't that good at it so I try and

00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:32,750
shield them from it by steering them

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,970
towards chunkier pieces of work

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:39,770
something they can concentrate on for a

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:43,340
day or half a day at a time but a lot of

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:49,160
the necessary context switching comes

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:52,160
from delays in communication so if I'm

00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,710
working on project a and then I have a

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,720
question

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,360
it goes over the wall to the client

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,450
and what do you do go for coffee or

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,740
start another card and then you can work

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:12,200
on that until you have a question and

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,950
you always go for the coffee always go

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,970
for the coffee

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:19,130
but that's where a lot of the context

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:22,280
switching comes from certainly from my

00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,800
experience where you are waiting for

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,710
feedback from a client so you've got

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:32,390
other tasks on the boil at the same time

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,100
but that's again where the sweeper role

00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,280
does help because they can do that

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,350
initial triage ask the questions and

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,400
move on they may not be working on that

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,630
ticket but they can come back to or you

00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,280
know when the information comes in they

00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,060
can then send it out to somebody else

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,300
who will be actually working on it

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:56,570
so whilst it's a place that does

00:34:53,300 --> 00:35:02,030
definitely have its challenges there's a

00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:07,100
lot of satisfaction to be had in the

00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:09,290
support world because on a project build

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:15,230
team you might not see your work

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:18,160
realized for six months whereas we all

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,020
crank out new features every day and

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,550
then you'll get the praise from the

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,560
client every day and that feels good you

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,410
get that sense of accomplishment of

00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,140
something's done and ticked off and life

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:35,009
and

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:38,200
if you like that's then come talk to me

00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:40,900
there's a lot to be said for the email

00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,279
from the client that goes thank you

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,400
thank you thank you thank you thank you

00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:49,470
you're a star with lots of exclamation

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,460
marks that feels good

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,349
the other thing that you have to be

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,239
aware of and the support team is

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,819
avoiding burnout and I know there's a

00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:00,730
session later on today I think half past

00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:02,499
eleven on building resilience in your

00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:10,650
team and burnout which probably worked

00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:16,329
going to but with and 122:6

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:19,450
when's yours David at twenty to six yeah

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:23,289
a lot the last slot and Burnett and

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:26,319
imposter syndrome but the where were

00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:28,049
they going the with the support team

00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:30,489
with all the clients and other sites

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:35,019
there's a huge background of stuff to be

00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:36,700
done and all of it is semi urgent needs

00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:39,400
to be done sooner rather than later

00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,769
you it's difficult for people sometimes

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,720
to switch off to step away and oh I'm

00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:46,420
done for the day I don't need to look at

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,309
ten more tickets or whatever it is and I

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,440
think it's just being aware of that the

00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:52,299
things can wait till tomorrow unless the

00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,599
site is offline and the house is burning

00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:59,440
down

00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:03,039
it can wait yeah the other thing to

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,259
mention I suppose is the possibility of

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,170
feeling isolated particularly in a

00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:11,279
distributed environment because we're

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,279
all work remotely

00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:21,400
but wait yeah you can feel overwhelmed

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:25,930
by the vast array of projects and styles

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,089
of site and code bases but you do have

00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:31,779
to remember that there is a team there

00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:35,589
to help and with measures like the

00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:37,809
bat-signal channel you feel like the

00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:40,809
rest of the team then has your back some

00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:43,779
more so it's less pressure on you which

00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:45,320
is very good flashback Friday we also

00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:49,610
have flashback Friday

00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:53,570
so this is another new measure that we

00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:56,960
put in place because we're all techies

00:37:53,570 --> 00:38:00,200
we don't really like phone calls so we

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:05,870
try and keep daily stand-ups out of our

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:11,600
lives so on a Friday for half an hour we

00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:14,260
have a scrum like call or a support

00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:19,730
group call yeah

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:20,300
so it's the format is a thing that went

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,100
well

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,110
during the week and a thing that could

00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,540
have gone better during the week and

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:31,100
everybody comes up with two things and

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,740
the idea is first so that we can just

00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,880
know what people have worked on that was

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:43,340
cool and secondly so that we can

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:45,860
identify areas for improvement and then

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:50,420
work on them to make our lives better be

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:54,830
it automate something or introduce some

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:59,090
new testing or the concept of flashback

00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:02,600
Friday itself but it's it's working too

00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:05,120
so I'm conscious that we're running out

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,590
of time I think we could probably stand

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,860
here for another half hour I keep on

00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,570
talking but is there any last point you

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,230
want to make or we throw it out to the

00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:20,000
floor for questions I need more people

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:22,190
so come talk to me but otherwise I was

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,050
wondering do you have a specific team

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,980
for support and another team for doing

00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,570
project work maybe I wasn't totally

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,910
clear and that's the beginning but when

00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,090
we won that project in 2013 which was a

00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,680
sinker day moment or seen her live fly

00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,050
whatever

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,910
we did like it was just Anthony on that

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:44,480
team and then it reached two people and

00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:47,330
then two years ago it went from two to

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,580
seven and they are fully dedicated to

00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,650
support and retain your clients and the

00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,690
project teams are protected from all

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:57,140
those little itsy-bitsy requests from

00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,030
retainer clients so when you deliver a

00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,880
project build by your

00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,280
members is there a kind of information

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,410
sharing moments there is a hand over

00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,100
there is documentation cannot say enough

00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:13,130
about having documentation but there is

00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,380
a handover process and a transition from

00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,150
the project team to the support team I

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,750
won't say that we have it fully polished

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,700
yet thus sometimes there's warranty sold

00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,980
as part of the project and there's sort

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,070
of a gray area there is to when exactly

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,840
is it fully in support versus still

00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,180
dealing with the project team but and

00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,160
because the other thing is because those

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,930
are sites that we build internally are

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,270
standardized and we have a starter kit

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:42,430
in this way of doing things the Einar

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:45,980
take away then you know it's easy enough

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:50,000
once we have an up-to-date readme file

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:52,510
in the project route we're happy we

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,980
don't always get it and then when when

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,170
support tickets lead to a mini project

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,580
like 40 hours at 80 hours is that done

00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:02,720
by the support team as well or goes it

00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,190
back to there generally and ideally it's

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,910
done by the support team

00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:12,170
I'll ring fence one or two developers to

00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:18,410
get that finished occasionally we're

00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:20,390
just too busy with casual extras because

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,820
as I mentioned some clients don't care

00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:26,750
about their subscription they just want

00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:32,740
more which is great so occasionally

00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:36,500
we'll get a couple of the more available

00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,240
developers from outside our team in but

00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,760
generally the support team would have

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,700
the capacity to take on a mini project

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,380
you know in a shorter time frame than a

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,750
project team or a project developer

00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,900
would be as they're on projects for two

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,690
three six months there they're locked

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,660
away essentially whereas you have a bit

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,000
more flexibility in that your projects

00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:02,780
normally lasts less than a day like the

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:08,270
