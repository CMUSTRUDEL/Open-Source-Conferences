This session will introduce two modules enhancing the editorial experience in Drupal 8 - Autosave Form and Conflict.

Autosave ensures that content changes will not be lost if a sudden power outage or network disruption occurs. The current state of each entity form is continuously autosaved, so that the user is able to always resume from the last autosaved state.

The concurrent editing feature provided by the conflict module allows for the simultaneous editing of the same content by multiple users. Whenever possible automatic merges are performed. When conflicts occur the user is provided with a visual tool for resolving them.

During this talk we'll take a look at the current state of the modules and what is yet to come. We will see how they could work independent of each other and what is the added value of enabling both of them. The modules are being developed with the idea of allowing for customizations and we'll dive deeper into both of them and clarify how their functionality could be extended or adjusted.
