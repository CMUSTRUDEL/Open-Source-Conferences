Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: Live preview with Gatsby and decoupled Drupal
Publication date: 2019-10-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Presenter: Preston So, Matt Davis
Description: Gatsby and Drupal fit together like peas in a pod, thanks to Gatsby’s first-class support for consuming Drupal data and Drupal’s improving API-first support. Gatsby, a web compiler for blazing fast websites and applications, is capable of building highly performant web experiences off the shelf, enriched even more by the administrative power of Drupal.

Nonetheless, though Drupal and Gatsby get along like a house on fire for developers, the same is not necessarily true for content editors and marketing teams that need high-fidelity content preview irrespective of the coupled or decoupled architecture underpinning websites. Moreover, editorial teams these days are not necessarily satisfied with even Drupal’s own preview capabilities, which lack real-time updates.

Projects involving Drupal and Gatsby tend to run into several major issues:

- The project requires running a local copy of the Gatsby development server and it needs to be restarted anytime an entity is changed on the Drupal website
- The project deploys changes when entities are updated or saved but this requires a complete rebuild of the site without knowing how the page will look when it goes live

Third & Grove architects and developers have been collaborating with the core Gatsby team and contributors to improve this content editing experience by introducing live preview capabilities to Gatsby sites consuming Drupal. This live preview experience means that a content editor can edit a Drupal entity and immediately see what it will look like on the Gatsby site before it gets deployed to production.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

- The history of CMS preview: What’s different today
- Why decoupled CMS preview is so challenging
- What is Gatsby? Why Gatsby?
- Decoupling Drupal with a Gatsby front end
- Introducing a content sync API to Drupal
- Challenges and insights during implementation
- Live demo: Live preview with Drupal and Gatsby

This session is geared toward developers, site builders, and content editors considering building a Gatsby site consuming Drupal. It’s also for those that have a Gatsby site in production consuming Drupal but are looking to improve the experience for content editors. But this session will also have something for anyone interested in decoupled CMS issues such as preview, editorial features, and JavaScript approaches.

Attendees will leave the session with strategies to improve the content editing process as well as knowledge on how to implement live preview on your Gatsby/Drupal architectures.

all righty how is everyone today

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:15,030
everyone say Drupal oh come on that was

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:18,449
come on let's say Drupal okay flip back

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,910
good afternoon or Quinn Avant basically

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,310
good evening and thank you all so much

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,789
for coming to live preview with Gatsby

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,550
and decouple Drupal this is going to be

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,480
a presentation that is when involves

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,030
some multimedia and it's my pleasure to

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,700
be here with my colleague Matt to talk

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,700
about this topic today first off though

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,520
let's have an alternate title for this

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,500
also Gatsby loves Drupal how many of you

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,000
have heard of Gatsby already in the room

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,260
oh wow okay about 80% how many of you

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,840
have already built a Gatsby site

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,730
interesting about 5% 10% okay so this

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,649
will be an interesting session for all

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,449
of you but first let's go ahead and

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,939
introduce ourselves you might be

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,900
wondering who we are my name is Preston

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,670
so you may know me from my book decouple

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,860
Drupal and practice I'm principal

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,840
product manager at Gatsby where I work

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,770
on the Gatsby developer experience our

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:27,659
Gatsby services and our platform as well

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:30,450
as our integration with Drupal how about

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,640
this one and I'm Matt Davis I am the

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,619
director of engineering for 3rd & Grove

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,420
and I've been a longtime Drupal

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,329
community member Preston and I actually

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,400
co-presented together for the first time

00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,710
about decoupled Drupal 8 Drupal con New

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,180
Orleans several years ago we're also the

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,549
cofounders of the decoupled days

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,829
conference which is the only conference

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,210
specifically about decoupled Drupal that

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,619
takes place every year in New York and

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,320
so with that let's go over a little bit

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,110
of what we will cover today so we're

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,869
going to go over a wide decoupled CMS

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,270
preview specifically is challenging I

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,789
will give a little intro to gatsby J s

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,039
talk about why it's great for drupal why

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,629
it's great for agencies and then we'll

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,800
walk you through setting up a live

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,880
preview on Gatsby

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,590
and Drupal with a actual demo then we'll

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,480
cover some of the challenges and

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,120
insights that we gained through building

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,890
this integration point and talked a

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,620
little bit about what's next and things

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,220
that we're excited about so let's dive

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,590
right in as how many of you have built a

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,150
decoupled Drupal site before regardless

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,060
of gatsby or not just any kind of

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,620
decoupled Drupal site okay okay maybe

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,650
about a quarter of you that's that's a

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,200
lot well well how many of you have built

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,950
a decoupled site that had preview built

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,190
into it very few I see one hand too many

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,440
people interesting yeah well so my

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,330
contention is that you know part of the

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,610
reason that people decouple there are

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,470
many but some of it is so that you have

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,150
a separation of concerns so that you can

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,220
have your back-end and your front-end

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,600
with their own feature velocity and

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,030
different development teams that are

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,010
working kind of independently and so one

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,350
of the goals oftentimes is that the

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,720
teams need to know as little about each

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,340
other's systems as possible so your

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,010
Drupal folks can really focus on the

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,230
Drupal build and your gatsby or whatever

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,780
front-end technology folks can really

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,940
focus on building that out but that

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,650
makes preview difficult because that

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,830
there needs to be an integration point

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,250
that has to be built by folks generally

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,959
who need to know both systems but the

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,209
bigger problem really it's not that

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,340
preview itself is all that difficult but

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,860
it's that making it a generalizable

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,530
solution is really the difficult part

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,730
because if you're building a back-end

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,250
and a front-end and you have the right

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,110
architects you can make preview work

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,200
with whatever front-end you're using

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,570
with Drupal but making a Gatsby

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
integration for example work across all

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,020
the different ways that we use Drupal

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,150
all the different workflows that

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,520
different marketing teams want to use

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,850
etc etc that's where it becomes really

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,430
difficult and so here are some of the

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,410
considerations that you have to take in

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,030
you have to encounter first and foremost

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,880
what kind of API layer are you going to

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,169
use this is decreasing Lee a problem I

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,270
would say in the Drupal world it used to

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,970
be all these custom REST API s and views

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,620
and things now we have JSON API in core

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,400
which is really kind of the contract

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,740
between front and back

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,750
and you also have to consider you know

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,060
preview is only actually useful if it's

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,199
high fidelity if it's giving market or

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,479
something that they can have high

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,770
confidence is what the site is actually

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,320
going to look like when they deploy it

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,000
live you have to consider whether they

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,039
only want to be able to preview locally

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,720
on their own machines or is this do they

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,699
need to generate a preview link that can

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,199
be shared around the company so that

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,419
other people can approve things like

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,190
that do they want to just be able to

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,810
preview one piece of content at a time

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,270
or do they want to be able to stage a

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,780
bunch of different changes and see all

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,000
of those together before deploying them

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,979
what about gated or permission content

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
and with all of this with the system

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,060
like Gatsby you also have to consider

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,630
build times and how do you give a

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,120
preview that feels really fluid and fast

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,940
so these are all things that at Drupal

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,410
con Seattle this spring we were talking

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,080
through some with Kyle Mathews the

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,539
creator of Gatsby and decided the time

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,340
was really right to really dive in and

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,370
so third and Grove and Gatsby team

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,760
partnered to really work on solving some

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,860
of these problems so now that we've

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,660
covered a little bit about why decoupled

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,940
CMS preview is so hard let's talk a

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,830
little bit about what exactly Gatsby is

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,139
and why people are so interested in

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,940
Gatsby so what are some of the

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,949
challenges of modern web development how

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,780
many people have already built a react

00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,320
application before in the room or view

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,229
j/s let start with react okay so about

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,940
40% of UJS in the room also about the

00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,590
same amount so one of the biggest

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,690
challenges that I think we all encounter

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,000
with modern web development these days

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,699
is the fact that getting started is

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,590
really hard back in the day when reacts

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,150
first came into being it was really

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,070
challenging to get started with what

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,780
libraries you would need what sorts of

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,510
dependencies you would need to juggle in

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,789
order to realize a very powerful app

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,880
that's easy to maintain and also is

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,680
going to last for a long time the way

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,389
that we manage data is also evolving

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,729
quite a bit back in the day you could

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,800
possibly create a really quick MongoDB

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,960
database and have really easy data

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,240
handling or you might use a very

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,620
rudimentary database but today one of

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
the things that we're encountering is

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,580
that a lot of people are using CMS's a

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,840
lot of people are using third-party

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,700
services

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,040
database systems that aren't really

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,570
necessarily catered towards the way that

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,060
we manage data and the way that we want

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,730
to consume data today getting all of

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,650
this right is really hard having to look

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,210
at how you want to handle things like

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,550
webpack dependencies how you want to

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,400
handle webpack configuration whether you

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,660
want to use babel what sort of linting

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,350
you want to use all of these

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:08,080
considerations become very challenging

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,300
gatsby first and foremost is a shortcut

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,880
it's a way to allow you as a developer

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,190
to very quickly build excellent apps and

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,960
sites that perform very well in a

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,970
variety of different environments we

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,340
often call Gatsby a site generator we

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,290
often call Gatsby a web framework a

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,080
react framework but I actually prefer to

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,580
call Gatsby a web compiler because it

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,669
makes it much easier for you to get

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,229
started and get going very quickly a lot

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,880
of the workflows that we work with today

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,010
involve a lot of boilerplate to get

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,540
started we have to think about a certain

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,639
procedure of ways in which we're going

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,410
to install dependencies a certain way in

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,570
which we're gonna have a new pipeline

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,460
introduced for C ICD how we're gonna

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,280
perform testing and all of these things

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,669
that are very familiar to us as both PHP

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,970
and JavaScript developers but the really

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,430
quintessential kind of benefit of using

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,500
Gatsby is the fact that number one you

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,960
have an incredible array of integrations

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,370
that matt mentioned with a variety of

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,140
different systems that all have

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,150
different ways of managing data all have

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,970
different purposes in your architecture

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,120
but are all easily managed within this

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,130
context of gatsby in short you can use

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,750
any kind of API in the backend and

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,520
consume that from the Gatsby side of

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,979
things graph QL content full WordPress

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,410
so and so forth and Gatsby gives you an

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,360
agnostic graph QL API that allows you to

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,410
query any of that data and shunt that

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,910
into a react application what that means

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,010
is that your experience as a developer

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,229
is very easy and it means that we

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,930
actually remove the boilerplate gatsby

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,400
is opinionated about what sorts of ways

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,200
you should use to get started it's kind

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,789
of similar to the concept of create

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,100
react app for example in the react

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,200
ecosystem and it's also intended to get

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,520
you deploying as quickly as possible to

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,080
production we as the Gatsby team obsess

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,090
over front and performance tunings so

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,630
you don't have to we make a lot of

00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,310
attempts within the Gatsby core project

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,480
to actually make it much easier for you

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,940
so you don't have to worry about things

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,490
like code splitting or lazy loading of

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,650
images or things of that nature

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,190
so in short Gatsby is an app as an app

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,870
compiler for react and Gatsby's goal is

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,630
to make what development ever more

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,550
powerful and simple one of the reasons

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,320
why Gatsby is attaining such high

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,520
adoption within not only the Drupal

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
community but also the WordPress

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,270
community and also within the larger

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,520
react community is the fact that it

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,490
makes it really easy to build a website

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,800
that is very performant and very very

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,360
easy to get started with one of the

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
things that the creator of Gatsby Kyle

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,410
Matthews likes to say is that with

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,210
gatsby all all slow web sites are

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,400
different in terms of how they're slow

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,650
but all fast web sites are alike and

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,339
with gatsby it's very easy to build a

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:51,010
fast web site so why is Gatsby so great

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,570
for Drupal one of the things that is

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,670
interesting about Gatsby is that a lot

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,050
of us come from various CMS ecosystems

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,240
some of us come from WordPress some of

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,760
us come from Drupal Kyle Mathews has

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,130
been in the Drupal community as well why

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,410
is it the decouple Drupal and Gatsby go

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,970
so well together one of the things that

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,070
we know about the ways in which

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,110
architectures are evolving in the CMS

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,089
world is that the way in which we've

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,890
built an architect at CMS is up until

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,390
now these giant monoliths with

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,370
inextricable layers that cannot be

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,440
separated these are actually being

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,630
replaced more and more by modular

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,970
specialized content systems they're

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,470
being replaced by different services

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,260
that are plug-and-play interchangeable

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,720
parts that actually allow you to build a

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,339
much more flexible CMS that isn't

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,740
restricted to the kinds of things

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,200
available in a single ecosystem let's

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,540
take one example here back in the day if

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,640
you were using Drupal in Drupal 7 Drupal

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,740
6 Drupal 5 even a lot of this

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,420
functionality was actually handled by

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,130
the Drupal ecosystem consider for

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,920
example some of these features like user

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,610
login or search rubric art for example

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,990
back when that existed for e-commerce

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,910
also form handling and the Google

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,529
Analytics module what we're finding

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,150
today is that this actually doesn't

00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,160
provide the best developer experience

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,720
for a lot of folks because what happens

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,100
when one of these dependencies goes out

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,330
of date what happens when a maintainer

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,499
decides to move on to a different

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,149
project

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,519
it's a very very big issue in our

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,019
ecosystem with the obsolescence of a lot

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,329
of these modules that we've come to rely

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,829
on many of us have clients sites that

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:19,929
rely on these modules and we have to

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,269
figure out new solutions for each of

00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,799
these components one of the things

00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,379
that's very compelling about gatsby is

00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,239
this notion of the content mesh and the

00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:30,159
content mesh is a term coined by gatsby

00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:32,139
co-founder Sontag watt and it's about

00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,309
this notion that you can really plug and

00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,769
play a lot of these different services

00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:38,049
you don't have to necessarily rely on in

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,039
a single ecosystem to provide all of

00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,559
these these different features that

00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,759
you've come to expect in a website you

00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,439
could be using something like an

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,119
authentication provider through auth0

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:47,709
you could use a search form that's

00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,689
provided by Al Galia you could use a

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,489
cart tool used by that that's provided

00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,159
by snip cart you could even have other

00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:56,109
CMS's my personal site for example uses

00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,509
multiple CMS's I have a Drupal 8

00:11:56,109 --> 00:12:00,999
installation as well as a contentful

00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,249
space that I leverage for my personal

00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:06,459
site and all of these different services

00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:08,319
are very very easy to leverage within

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,649
this environment and gatsby makes it

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,479
deeply easy to not only decouple the CMS

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,069
itself where you take the front-end and

00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:17,079
separate it from the backend but

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,809
actually to decouple the presentation

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,909
layer itself to decouple the page itself

00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:25,089
so you're no longer relying on a single

00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:27,489
source or a single ecosystem for your

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,919
page itself you can be using various

00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:31,389
third-party services various startups to

00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,279
make this work and if a startup goes

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,639
bust go ahead and go to a different

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,079
ecosystem and leverage those tools over

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,639
the course of time what we're seeing as

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,649
a result of this evolution towards

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,509
Gatsby in a result of this transition

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,159
towards these architectures is the

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,799
notion that you're no longer tied to

00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,269
having to rely solely on Drupal you can

00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,189
use the tool that's the right one for

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,869
the job if you have a commerce tool that

00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,519
you really enjoy you can go ahead and

00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:55,959
use that if you have a CMS you really

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,970
enjoy or a search provider you really

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,609
enjoy you can use those tools all

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,319
without having to worry about replacing

00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:05,139
them in the long run or their

00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,329
obsolescence if you want to know more

00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,579
information about the content mesh it's

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,679
related to kind of the pre-existing idea

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,299
of a service mesh in the micro services

00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,919
community and the ways in which we've

00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:17,019
really built services or in

00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,209
architectures there's a series of blog

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,309
posts by sandbag watt called journey to

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,300
the content mesh I highly recommend you

00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,010
take a look

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,990
that blog post series for more

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,270
information so this is kind of the crux

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,580
of what Gatsby provides you it provides

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,930
you this incredible integration layer

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,640
between all of these different services

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,980
that you no longer have to manage

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,600
yourself it provides an agnostic graph

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,520
QL API that allows you to query data

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,500
regardless of where it comes from using

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,690
a single approach so you get just the

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,540
data you need no more no less and you

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,240
only have to consume one single API in

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,010
the process and finally you can use all

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,170
of the things that you enjoy about react

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,940
declarative rendering colocation of

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,860
queries and templates all of these

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,530
things that the react community knows

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,440
and loves very well and also push them

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,780
to a CDN publish your site to a service

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,120
like net with Phi and not have to pay a

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,070
single cent in the process for my

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,770
personal site I pay zero dollars for

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,870
hosting I used to pay a pretty large fee

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,210
every single month but now I host my

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,830
Drupal site for free I host my Gatsby

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,980
site for free and I don't pay a single

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,450
penny for hosting anymore so Gatsby can

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,890
be considered really the clue the glue

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,690
for the content mesh it's what brings

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,310
all of these things together and marries

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,440
all of these components together in a

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,960
way that makes sense and even Driss by

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,420
thoughts he himself said back in the day

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,280
earlier this year that a lot of times

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,750
we're having trouble resourcing a lot of

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,520
our front-end projects we're having

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,470
trouble finding really advanced twig

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,390
developers who are knowledgeable about

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,710
Drupal internals and moving to a

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,780
JavaScript driven front-end like Gatsby

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,070
one that's very powerful and performant

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,960
and robust and has a lot of these

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,120
integrations already resolved for you

00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,890
can really help you with a lot of the

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,050
staffing challenges that we face today

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,640
because after all we're not just talking

00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,140
about developer experience we're also

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,750
talking about all of the stakeholders

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,810
and the clients that pay our paycheck

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,890
every month so why is the couple Drupal

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,390
and Gatsby

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,830
why are they so good for each other

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,720
first of all we know that JSON API is

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,400
part of Drupal core which is really

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,840
great because it means that only after a

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,640
few clicks you can go ahead and install

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,370
Drupal 8 and you have Drupal as a

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,080
headless CMS and API enabled it's a very

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,510
simple process it's part of core which

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,610
makes it very easy to get started in

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,830
addition as soon as you enable JSON API

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,720
you get a very nice REST API that you

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,700
can read and write to it's very powerful

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,530
and I want to thank of course the entire

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,460
API and the API first initiative team

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:39,520
for making this whole module possible

00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,520
in Drupal core we also have a very fast

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,100
a quickly growing ecosystem in Drupal

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,840
for Gatsby I'm sorry in Gatsby for

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,460
Drupal one of the things that you might

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,020
know about Gatsby is that the way in

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,220
which you retrieve data or the way in

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,010
which you integrate with other data

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,630
sources is through gatsby source drupal

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,770
or source plugins we have source

00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,470
plug-ins for a variety of different

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,200
services and we also have a new emerging

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,760
Gatsby theme Drupal which is a little

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,130
bit outside of the scope of this session

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,650
but we'll be happy to answer and talk

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,540
more about that afterwards Gatsby source

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,670
Drupal is really great because you can

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,350
basically leverage any Drupal 8 site out

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,390
of the box as your back-end for Gatsby

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,880
retrieve any sort of data you need from

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,440
that source and what gatsby source

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,450
drupal does is it takes all of the

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,820
resources available in your Jason API

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,440
implementation on Drupal makes those

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,570
available through the gaps for the the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,910
gatsby graph QL API so you can now

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,140
consume all of this data in a very very

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:36,280
nice and easy to use fashion also one of

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,290
the things that's most important to

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,030
realize about our communities is that

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,920
Drupal and gatsby both have really

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,600
passionate friendly welcoming

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,400
communities that have people who love to

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,970
help and if you open an issue in the

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,820
issue queue

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,490
it'll be very quickly addressed and very

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,230
quickly resolved now to Matt to talk a

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,450
little bit more about what exactly is

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,360
the value proposition of gatsby for us

00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,540
today thanks Kristin yeah absolutely so

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,850
as the head of an engineering team part

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,830
of what I have to consider is when and

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,410
what technologies we pitch to clients

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,360
and so there are a few different reasons

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,890
that I want to go over that we're really

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,080
looking at Gatsby is something we pitch

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,250
but it also is something that's really

00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,810
useful to us as an internal team as well

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,280
so first and foremost the the primary

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,150
consideration is the effect it has on

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,310
clients right so I don't know if Gatsby

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,960
is a one size fits all for every single

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,400
one of third and Grove's clients today

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
but it's certainly something that we

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,720
look to as an opportunity in many cases

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,300
these days primarily first and foremost

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,970
because of the performance metrics that

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,260
it gives so third and Grove does a lot

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,100
in the commerce space which I'll talk a

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,390
little bit more about in a moment but

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,270
there was a statistic a few years ago

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,230
where Amazon found that for every tenth

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,080
of a second that they

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,330
have pages load faster they gained one

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,299
extra percent in revenue so there's a

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,700
direct line between end-user performance

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,220
and actual revenue streams and

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,779
conversion rates for sites so being able

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,139
to focus on that and really emphasize

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:11,710
that in a sales pitch is a great way to

00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:13,330
win new clients it's also a really

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,210
important from my perspective for

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,250
front-end consistency so as I alluded to

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,389
earlier third and Grove does a lot of

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,120
Drupal work but it's not the only

00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:24,429
platform that we work in we probably do

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,649
about 80% Drupal work but we also do

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,480
some WordPress and we do several

00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:31,779
different commerce platforms as well

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,740
whether it's Magento or big commerce or

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,179
Shopify plus and so that can pose some

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,500
challenges in terms of having to have

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,019
the expertise for each of those

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,299
platforms on the team whereas if we

00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,730
start to solidify around using Gatsby

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,889
more and more we can just hire modern

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,659
front-end developers and throw them at

00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:50,559
any of these kinds of projects and they

00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:53,440
can run with the front end

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,929
implementation so for me as someone

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,080
who's in charge of hiring that's huge

00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:02,159
and and on that point hiring in general

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,169
I found that it's vastly easier to find

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,690
talented front-end developers outside of

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:10,960
the Drupal world than to find the top

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,450
best-in-class Drupal theme erse I also

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,250
another point on that for my internal

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,440
team who are my existing front-end

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,909
developers they are super eager and

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,220
excited to be learning this stuff too

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,200
because I think that there's a feeling

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,840
within especially on the front-end side

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,580
of Drupal that folks are starting to get

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,059
left behind when you're still writing

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,740
jQuery in 2019 for example there's a

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,659
feeling that you know the rest of the

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,029
the web ecosystem is kind of moving

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,740
beyond us so all of these are it's great

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,320
for retention for that reason as well

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,880
because people are excited to be thrown

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,010
into learning what they feel is like the

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,299
new thing that people are coalescing

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,220
around and also gatsby is great for

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,889
design centered build because so much of

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,409
the momentum and modern front-end

00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:57,700
ecosystem is around react and around

00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,799
these modern JavaScript frameworks

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,679
that's where the talent is going these

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,570
days and so the best design minded

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,130
front-end develop

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,800
overall tend to be working in these

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,020
kinds of technologies so we found as we

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,440
focused more on delivering best-in-class

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,920
creative focusing on these technologies

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,500
has really made a difference so a couple

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,570
of use cases this is actually a site

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,300
built by one of our friends over at

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,690
media current the city the city springs

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,150
web site very cool gas beside city

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,910
Springs calm you'll see the performance

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,980
is great it powers not only their

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,290
desktop web site but a bunch of kiosks

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,420
that they have around the city as well

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,120
so that was a cool use case for doing

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,700
the kind of multi-tenant multi-channel

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,160
experience with gatsby fronting all of

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,240
it a third and Grove actually just

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,170
rebuilt our own site in Gatsby as well

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,230
definitely encourage you to check that

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,660
out the performance is amazing I think

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,280
that you'll see especially considering

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,070
the amount that we have going on there

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,990
in terms of animations and custom fonts

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,390
and we really push the envelope with

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,950
what creative could do on the site and

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,200
we really tried to cater to the vision

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,630
of our creative team in a way while

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,680
still delivering amazing end-user

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,840
performance and we have several other

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,150
much larger Gatsby projects that are in

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,040
the works right now that I unfortunately

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,840
can't show today but we're really

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,940
excited to be talking publicly about the

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,560
same already so now so let's start

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,080
talking about kind of how we actually

00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,350
get started with preview and Gatsby and

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,520
Drupal it's a really interesting process

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,960
obviously one of the reasons why we want

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,260
to do this is because we can leverage

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,180
all the benefits of a CMS in Drupal as

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,400
well as all the advantages that we have

00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,370
in Gatsby the first thing I want to do

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,560
by the way is to acknowledge this team

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,990
we've been working as part of the Gatsby

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,330
Drupal working group folks from the 13

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,450
Grove team have been working on the

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,920
Drupal side of the Gatsby integration

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,050
for preview and I want to recognize

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,180
Grant Glidewell Shane Thomas John

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,850
Entwistle and of course our friend Matt

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,240
Davis as well as the Gatsby core team

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,710
and Gatsby the Gatsby product team so

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,140
that includes Dustin Chou and Kyle

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,120
Matthews all of us have been working too

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,130
they're really hard to realize this kind

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,250
of you know interesting integration that

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,970
will really change and revolutionize the

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,110
way that people use preview in Gatsby by

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,179
the way if you're interested in using

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,309
this service today you can do this right

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,590
now we're gonna be going a little bit

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,480
too fast for you to code this live and

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,460
to follow along live but if you'd like

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,370
to go ahead and sign up for a 14-day

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,190
free trial Gatsby preview is already in

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:48,100
open beta it's at Gatsby Jas calm /

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,840
preview and this is what the site looks

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,669
like we have integrations available with

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,460
a bunch of different CMS's including

00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:57,929
contentful sanity data CMS content stack

00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,280
Drupal and actually just recently we are

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:02,380
we implemented the cosmic j/s

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,799
integration if you're using that as your

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,450
CMS one thing that you might want to do

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,340
very quickly is you could set up a free

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,200
Drupal site on Pantheon just to get

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,030
going very quickly and it allows you to

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,419
really quickly spin up a new Drupal

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,990
instance and looks like the we're having

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:24,299
some issues with the video here that's

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,700
not good so while we're doing this maybe

00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:30,309
Matt do you want to talk briefly about

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,570
why you've been using Gatsby at 13 Grove

00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,330
while I resolve this technical

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,600
difficulty we'll be back in just a

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,760
moment sure so like I mentioned before I

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,290
think that the end user performance is a

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,320
key thing but I'd also like to highlight

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,940
the graph QL side of things which has

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,480
been for our front-end developers a

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,370
really exciting tool set to be using if

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,650
you're not familiar with it it's kind of

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,500
flipping on the head the dynamic of a

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:59,860
traditional REST API so in the in the

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,660
traditional REST API sense someone on

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,510
the backend has to set up and model all

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,010
of the data and expose it out to the

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,480
front Enders and every time you need a

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,630
new piece of data you have to kind of go

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,960
say hey build me a new API graph QL kind

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,520
of flips that on its head and it has

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,220
strong knowledge of all of the data that

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,240
it has access to and it lets the

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,429
front-end developer build queries

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,880
themselves that render and mock the data

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:30,580
out so you can build specific queries in

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,890
the front-end and get the exact struck

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,130
the exact data returned to you that you

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,960
need at at runtime when you're when

00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,550
you're actually using it okay Gatsby

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,160
uses it a little bit differently because

00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:44,380
it goes through like Preston was talking

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,930
about with the content mesh and goes to

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,910
each external data source and slurps in

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,390
all of that data and then at Build time

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,520
it creates a graph QL server that runs

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:58,590
queries that are in your grout in your

00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,590
Gatsby build and uses the data that way

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,330
were you able to get that to work so we

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,220
do have an issue with the availability

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,280
of the videos here but the good news is

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,470
I have offline versions of the video as

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,790
well so what we're gonna do is very

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,560
quickly I'm gonna scrub through this

00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,090
since we're gonna need to skip through

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,770
this kind of quickly but this just

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,420
really quickly shows you how to create a

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,930
new Pantheon site

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,190
I created this demo for the presentation

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,290
I gave recently in Portland

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,270
obviously Pantheon is a really great

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,070
host if you need a free Drupal site and

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,360
just need to get started very very

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,590
quickly

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,440
one of the things that you can do is

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,440
very quickly deploy your Drupal site get

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,840
everything going for this actual Drupal

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,910
site we're using the umami distribution

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,910
in order to access all of those demo

00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,320
features that we like in Drupal and you

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,000
can set this up very easily I'm sure

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,930
many of you know how to set this up in

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,610
Pantheon the next video but first let's

00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,270
go back to the content very briefly here

00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,620
let me just fine and we Apollo us this

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,970
is something I should have tested before

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,410
we got into this right here

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,120
the other thing that you're gonna want

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,040
to do is to configure the course on

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,100
cross-origin resource sharing in order

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,940
to allow for your Drupal site to be

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,020
accessed by your Gatsby site so for

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,610
those of you who aren't familiar with

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,850
this process what you need to do to

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,340
enable this is to copy your you know

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,890
create a new services yamo file set your

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,630
desired can a course configuration and

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,920
you know potentially for example the

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,200
configuration I'm about to show you is

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,460
not something you should use in

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,180
production how many people are familiar

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,650
with course by the way in Drupal ok I'm

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,140
gonna show this very quickly just so

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,570
that those of you who don't understand

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,340
seen this before will be able to see

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,790
this

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,410
at in-process so what I'm doing here is

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,440
I'm actually pulling down my Drupal site

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,880
from Pantheon and enabling my you know

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,260
basically local development with this

00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,450
and what you'll see later on here is the

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,620
ability to actually and this is actually

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,330
great actually QuickTime is great for

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,860
this because it means I can speed up a

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,040
little bit as opposed to skipping ahead

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,200
so we're opening default services yamo

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,210
here and what you want to do is go all

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,510
the way down to and duplicate the file

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,920
move it into services yamo and go ahead

00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,070
and configure it so that your

00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,500
your-your-your gatsby site can access

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,370
your drupal site that you've set up

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,070
obviously the other thing you want to do

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,690
in this process as well is to write some

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,460
content put in some data some

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,560
rudimentary data that you can consume

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,600
and now the really good thing about this

00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,910
course configuration that you see here

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,790
is that it is allowing any header any

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,080
domain any person to access your Drupal

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,600
site but that's usually not something

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,430
you want to do in production actually

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,200
it's really never something you want to

00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:52,260
do in production so the next step is to

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,490
do exactly that now one of the things

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,050
that's going to be a little bit unique

00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,970
to this process is that we're actually

00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:00,930
going to go ahead and import our gatsby

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,030
site into gatsby preview itself so

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,940
there's several ways to do this we have

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,680
what's called a automatic provisioning

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,810
available in Gatsby

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,720
preview which allows you to go ahead and

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,670
create a new site and configure all of

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,630
the things that you need to do and so

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,750
for example right here we're gonna

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:22,020
create a new Gatsby site and configure

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,280
the Drupal base URL that is tied to the

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,430
Drupal site that we're going to use for

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,560
this and there's a little bit of a

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,650
process here to provision the new site

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,630
in gatsby preview and as you can see

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,860
it's gonna take a little while but what

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,550
we're creating here is a new test

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,800
instance for our gatsby site and as you

00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,200
can see already we're performing our

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,690
initial build of the preview instance

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,920
which will allow us to access a staged

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,990
preview version of the gatsby site the

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,060
ultimate result here if I go through and

00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,920
scrub here is that you'll see that

00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,170
finally we have our Gatsby site

00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,120
available

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,070
now just to go back and skip ahead a

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,680
little bit the next thing that you're

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,470
going to want to do is to install the

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,480
Gatsby live preview module so there's

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,720
several ways to do this you can install

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,180
the Gatsby module by using composer you

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,740
can obviously use a tarball

00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,760
things of that nature you can and then

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,640
what you want to do is you want to

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,620
actually go into the help options which

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,860
is currently where the configuration is

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,450
located and you're gonna want to save

00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,300
that configuration by putting in your

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,040
Gatsby preview URL and I'll show you

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,200
what that looks like in just a moment

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:39,050
here so let's go ahead and take a live

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,640
demo here we're not gonna risk it with

00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,950
the Wi-Fi I think that the Wi-Fi has

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,880
been a little bit finicky today so let's

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,310
go ahead and take a look at a live

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,710
preview so this is using my personal

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:53,180
site and I wonder if I can fullscreen

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:55,160
this let me see if I can fullscreen okay

00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,200
well sorry about that QuickTime doesn't

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,060
let me fullscreen but so what we're

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,240
doing here is we're configuring the

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,980
Gatsby preview server URL here on the

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,750
right side now what you can see is if

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,030
I'm going to my Gatsby preview site you

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,590
can see my URL is available there for me

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,990
to take and put into my Gatsby live

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,550
preview module configuration now when I

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,250
go to my preview instance this is

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,810
actually a staged preview version of my

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,400
site this is not a live version of my

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,740
site and as you can see what I've done

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,130
here is I've pulled all of my past talks

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,530
and all of my past sessions into my

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,940
Gatsby site from Drupal what you can see

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,150
here is I've added some text the title

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,760
and as you can see the preview actually

00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,370
updates on Gatsby faster than the Drupal

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,290
page refreshes and just because that was

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,970
very fast let me just go back so you can

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,070
see that one more time because it is

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,470
very fast and we like to talk about how

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,720
fast Gatsby is so just to show you that

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:51,440
again as you can see I've inserted some

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,200
text that says hello from Drupal into my

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,910
node in Drupal into the title and

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,770
obviously you can do this with any of

00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,050
your fields that are in your content

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,630
entity now when I hit save just watch

00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:05,600
very closely here you can see that even

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:09,520
before you leave the page that Gatsby

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,520
preview updates pretty impressive right

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,210
and you can even you know add more text

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,320
very quickly and it updates

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,119
instantaneously

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,220
I made the mistake once of actually

00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,480
doing this on my live Drupal site and so

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,679
I actually if you looked at my site

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,299
recently you might have seen some

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,580
gobbledygook from previous demos I've

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:30,460
done on this but as you can see it's

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,679
very fast it's instantaneous and it

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,799
really operates very well and this is

00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,259
what live preview with Drupal in Gatsby

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:42,220
looks like so now back to the

00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:44,889
presentation and apologies for this

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,990
these technical difficulties here let's

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:49,570
talk a little bit about now what were

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:54,100
some of the things that we learned from

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:55,509
this whole process cool thank you so as

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,249
I mentioned at the beginning the the

00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,749
first thing we really had to figure out

00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,340
was which approach we were gonna take

00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:03,519
all the different use cases that people

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,220
may want to use preview with Drupal and

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,529
Gatsby and how we prioritize things so

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,960
we very much took kind of a crawl walk

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,820
run approach here and so the current

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,309
implementation is fast and amazing as

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,320
that is is really just the beginning of

00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,299
what I think we can get to but let's

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,700
talk about some of the problems that led

00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:25,419
us to the approach that we took in the

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,070
first place so first and foremost and

00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,990
you you may or may not have noticed but

00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,919
in that preview that Preston did he was

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,029
actually having to hit the Save button

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,379
to create a preview and Gatsby so right

00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:38,139
now it would it would be great if you

00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:40,179
could just create a draft in preview

00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:42,820
state the same way that you do in Drupal

00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:44,590
itself but unfortunately forms API has

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,059
some legacy behavior that really

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,269
complicates this in terms of render

00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:51,279
arrays and in terms of because the

00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:54,460
canonical source for gatsby source

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,090
plugin has to be json api formatted data

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,590
getting that from a non saved entity in

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,929
Drupal 8 today is actually quite

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,850
challenging so that was one thing that

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,639
we definitely ran into and basically

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,970
punted on and said saving it for now is

00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:13,330
good enough another challenge is that

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,730
JSON API has no internal API is that

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:19,899
your technically supposed to be using

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:22,149
today so the only recommended way to get

00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:25,460
a JSON API formatted

00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:28,190
data for for an entity today is to make

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,200
an HTTP request over the wire but

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,179
obviously if we're in using it as an

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,490
internal Drupal module that's not ideal

00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,980
for us so we're basically having to

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,840
chase head with JSON API right now to

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,090
keep things up to date as some of the

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,500
internals are shifting and they're

00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,309
stabilizing but that's a temporary

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,320
situation so like I said that that's

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,460
really kind of just the cusp of what's

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,250
possible here with this kind of

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,020
integration and so the third and Grove

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,840
and the Gatsby team and some other

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,299
partners are working on this working

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,240
group to really explore what's next and

00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:04,100
what's possible here so our friends over

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,620
at media current another Drupal agency

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,139
have built an amazing decoupled

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,210
distribution called 'rain and we're

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,010
really excited to look at some

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,540
integration points there I'll show a

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,330
screenshot that highlights some of those

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,790
features in a moment we're adding

00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,859
support very soon for content moderation

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,810
so what this would do is instead of

00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,490
saving a new published version we would

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,800
have our own workflow state that was

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,570
gatsby preview or something that would

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,389
be the first state that things were

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,520
saved to and then you could move content

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,859
through the workflow moderation system

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,810
as you as you like

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:41,270
we're also this is a longer tail thing

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,149
but we're working on creating a sync API

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,560
in Drupal and combining that with the

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:48,649
work that's being done on the Gatsby

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,270
side to support incremental rebuilds so

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:53,030
that we can really make it even faster

00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:55,760
and more performant across really large

00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,139
sites yeah and just to talk briefly

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,480
about that one of the biggest issues

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,460
that a lot of people face today is that

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,099
if you have a very large Drupal site or

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,619
a very large sort you know very large

00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,810
data source with a hundred thousand or a

00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,210
million pages for example or entities

00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,490
that you need to process doing a rebuild

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,410
of that entire gatsby site can be very

00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,020
time consuming and so the idea behind

00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,940
incremental rebuilds is to enable only

00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,430
the differential only that difference

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,260
between the former state of the content

00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,089
and the new state of the content to be

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,950
reflected so only that content that is

00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,109
only those pages that have that content

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,380
leveraged on those pages will actually

00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:35,110
be rebuilt under incremental rebuilds

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,780
yeah exactly so

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,250
we're talking about and still kind of

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,760
considering is keystroke by keystroke

00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,500
preview so that as every single time you

00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,890
type of key or add an image or things

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,080
like that

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,500
it's instantaneously in real time

00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,670
showing up in your preview and Gatsby

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,290
there's some technical challenges there

00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,780
that I'd love to talk with people after

00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,010
this about and some others that we're

00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,660
considering and having some

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,910
conversations about but aren't sure

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,980
exactly what they would look like some

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,650
people have asked about having an iframe

00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,630
we're side by side in your editing form

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,120
you could actually be seeing in real

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,340
time a preview instance sitting right

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,260
next to your form and we've also been

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,570
talking with some of the Drupal hosting

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,060
companies about potentially really

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,680
having first-class support for this

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,140
integration point so that the type of

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,060
cores and configuration things that

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,160
Preston walked you through wouldn't even

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,410
be Paul wouldn't even be necessary you

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,420
could just spin up an instance of Drupal

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:36,610
8 and have Gatsby sitting they're

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:38,530
already connected and ready to go and

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:41,320
yeah this is the raine distribution that

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,240
I alluded to earlier as you can see it

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,850
adds some editorial enhancements to

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,230
paragraphs and things but it also has

00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:51,280
that nifty little button down at the

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:53,230
bottom for open in Gatsby preview one of

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,790
the things about this is that because

00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,470
it's not deploying live you can actually

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,690
at change make a bunch of different

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,210
changes and they all get reflected in

00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,960
the preview state so we're also using

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:07,180
the build States module so that you can

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,610
choose and you can track how many

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,590
changes you've made and choose to deploy

00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,600
those when you're ready and satisfied

00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,560
with what your preview looks like so

00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,860
hopefully all of that will get

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,160
integrated into rain very soon and yeah

00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:25,360
this is just the screenshot from a live

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,190
preview instance as we already saw so

00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,390
what are some interesting takeaways and

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,640
conclusions that we can draw from this

00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,800
the first is that Google Google sorry

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,620
yeah the other gee the other big G in

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,720
the room Gatsby is not just for static

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,370
sites Gatsby is something that you might

00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,820
have heard of as a static site generator

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:44,350
very similar to Jekyll or Hugo but

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,670
Gatsby is actually much more than that

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,190
you can build highly dynamic

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,980
applications with gatsby as well and

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,900
it's really great

00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,290
for CMS driven sites - if you want to

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,850
enable something like live preview you

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,800
got to be source Drupal plug-in allows

00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,020
you to pull content from any Drupal 8

00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,730
site as long as it has JSON API enabled

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,740
which is of course available in core now

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,240
and the great thing about the graph

00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,890
k.will API and gatsby is that you can

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,300
query your drupal data you can query any

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,670
other data that you're pulling from at

00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,460
the same time within your gatsby

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,020
application and of course it retains all

00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,030
of those really great benefits that we

00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,460
get from switching to a react driven

00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,720
development workflow where we can do

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,270
things like declarative rendering

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,070
leverage JSX leverage a lot of the

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,810
practices best practices that have

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,330
emerged in the react ecosystem and that

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:32,480
we've pulled as well into the gatsby

00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,400
ecosystem so live preview is ready for

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,790
you if you want to try it out once again

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,560
gatsby j Escom slash preview the Gatsby

00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,900
live preview module is also available

00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,480
we'd love to hear your thoughts feedback

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,609
any bug reports contributions are also

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,640
welcome if you go to Drupal org slash

00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:53,630
project slash Gatsby that's where it is

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,320
and please try it out today thank you

00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:00,350
very much donkey Bell

00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:02,340
[Applause]

00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,630
we have listened in a minute I don't

00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,010
know if we have time for questions yeah

00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,830
I think we can take one one or two

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,130
questions maybe and since we don't have

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,640
a mic stand we'll go ahead and repeat

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,640
questions from the audience

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:25,320
Tezz these work any questions all righty

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,300
well thank you for a great DrupalCon

00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,680
pulled scenes and we'll be here

00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,920
afterwards a little bit if you'd like to
