Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: Forget YouTube! We take Drupal to the next level with enterprise video
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Kay Werner, Christian Kretzschmar, Nikolay Borisov
T-Systems Multimedia Solutions GmbH, Dresden, Germany

We developed an enterprise video on demand platform to make YouTube embedding obsolete for those who want to use the power of moving images. Enhanced by our Drupal VoD solution, management information becomes more vivid and personal. We're taking corporate communication to the next level by offering vlogs and online sessions instead of manuals and written announciations.
Editors get full controll on their content by using their own platform instead of YouTube & Co.
Employees expect to have the same comforts they find in their private lifes. With VoD, participation is visible through clicks and comments on videos. Direct feedback is a key to user engagement.
We want to share how we used the strengths of Drupal for the development of a flexible and modular solution. Based on gained experience with customer projects, we also want to talk about the technical challenges and shortcuts.

	00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,890
so really proud to be here and to

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,130
present you one of our latest Drupal and

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,099
features training projects we this is

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,259
Kai Nikolai and me and we're working for

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,619
t-systems multimedia solutions and based

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,109
in Germany and there we are part of an

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,410
awesome cross-functional team of

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,510
software developers and architects

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:27,150
architects consultants and project

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,730
managers and with all these different

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,759
skill sets in one place we're involved

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,920
in a wide spectrum of topics in the area

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,559
of the work for example change and

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,200
adoption conversational interfaces and

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:45,690
of course Enterprise video streaming so

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,620
and now as you know who we are

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,280
I will send over to Takei who will tell

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,489
you why you should forget YouTube and

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,219
how we combine Drupal and our video

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:04,799
streaming and a video streaming

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:08,340
expertise so yeah yeah let's start with

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:15,659
the challenge with the idea of the

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:17,250
project so we had met some requests from

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,580
the customer and there was of course

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,310
like a typical project some requirements

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,369
but not all they just want to see how it

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,049
is going to be here how it can look like

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,750
so that means we need to start fast we

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,880
want to make some progress and then we

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,020
want to show all the results to the

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,610
customer and develop yeah good platform

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,079
that solved need and see how it is

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:53,939
working maybe do another cycle of that

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:56,960
at least we need the goal was to develop

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,000
an enterprise video on-demand platform

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,759
that is accessible from the internal

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,119
network and the internet so maybe this

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,960
is a special need for this customer but

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,190
it was priority number one

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,290
of course the the platform must be

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,300
state-of-the-art so responsive and and

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,080
all stuff like that like as you all know

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,350
that and lots of third-party services

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,140
must be connected and also our platform

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,370
needs to be included into other

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,620
[Music]

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,700
platforms like elearning systems they

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,560
want to use the videos in their learning

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,760
systems and they have quite a lot of

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:48,380
this and yeah at least user management

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:51,800
should be included so therefore we

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,770
thought about what to use and we came to

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Cooper also because of these two guys

00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,140
there are two cloud developers and let's

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,820
have a look to the high level

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:09,290
architecture get it just simple scheme

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,860
to give you an high level view how

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,310
things are going and how we decided to

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:21,080
manage these problems you can see we

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,269
have these two sites only one only one

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,820
hand the internet connection and the

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:30,049
other side the internal network of the

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,730
customer both are accessing our

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:36,110
applications through load balancer

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:38,780
within the open telecom cloud that's the

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,820
big part in the middle of course the

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,630
application is the is the triple

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,430
application that is built on the base of

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:52,720
kubernetes with the DB connected

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:57,260
database connected and through Power Act

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,989
the yeah maybe let's say the management

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,829
system for all the video files that's

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:10,810
all yeah just is external search this is

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:14,420
mounted the NFS share all content is

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,370
yeah effect on this storage for maybe

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,359
two reasons one is of course lots of

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,430
files others if we need the whole

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,009
vanitas classes to have access on it and

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,520
the last one is that the streaming

00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:31,250
server that would have to stream all the

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:36,039
video chunks to the users and it's also

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,039
at least reading access to the storage

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:46,580
one of the security services is on the

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,830
right side on left side from your point

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,590
of view and the encoding services so

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,979
really we get the original video files

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,319
from the users store them and our search

00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,310
but also sent them back to the encoding

00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:05,000
services for current implementation this

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,370
is the other as a media services and we

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,610
will get the results back the included

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:18,830
files and take them again in our network

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:21,430
yeah let's have a look at the key

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,430
features

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:34,230
I did a little screencast for you so to

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,020
show you some just some basic features

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,650
at least just view with some channels

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,830
there you can divide the the content

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:47,400
each channel can have several videos and

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,960
at least you have for the editors that

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,090
are authenticated

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,420
a list of videos that are already in the

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,750
system and are created as an example I

00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,380
would just create a video just at the

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:05,100
title drop video file over here upload

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,280
it and select the language for that

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,210
because our platform is multilingual and

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,990
you can also store for each language

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,370
several or as a for every language

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,460
single video yep

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,380
if you have safeties once then in the

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,290
background the encoding process and

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,060
starts running and you can keep editing

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:37,790
the video at some content at some

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:40,410
categories and also at some chapters

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,280
chapters are yeah interesting for most

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,590
of our customers because they they want

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,990
just point to one time slot at the video

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,190
and don't want to use this to to watch a

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:57,230
whole video of one hour if they have

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,230
some important information shifted here

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,880
now already if the video is not really

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:09,020
encoded yet you can still watch the

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,680
preview this is available right at the

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,310
beginning you can test if your chapters

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:22,580
are working but everything is fine and

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:27,410
also jump around within this yeah time

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,910
swaps video if everything works as

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,410
expected of course go on with workflow I

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,780
take the video and publish it for all

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:43,250
users until you can also start and that

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:45,710
in this video in to other sites page you

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,310
can see the video is already cute for

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,990
the encoding service so there's also the

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,230
feedback for the editor

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,040
something is happening in the background

00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:00,190
everything works as expected so now

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:04,330
everything's good

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,730
so what's next yeah so you can see for

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,670
example the embed code to include this

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,690
video into learning learning management

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,790
systems or other elearning platforms or

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:19,090
whatever you want and you will also get

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,970
if the video is ready encoded some

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:28,000
direct links to the manifest so this was

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:30,190
a special just case for customer yeah

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,260
now the first sample is already

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:38,140
generated so you can also choose between

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,280
I guess the the basic configuration is

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,890
between 10 sometimes you look at the

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:52,390
video in three different qualities for

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:53,410
encoding is ready and let's go to the

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,040
next slide

00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:00,570
yes additional additionally Watson and

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,850
we had some features that need

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,890
whitelisting for a customer that means I

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,070
talked about embedding to other

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,380
platforms they just want their videos

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,290
within their platform staredown want to

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,470
use this to take the videos out and

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,320
publish them in the whole internet so we

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,800
need to implement whitelisting for

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,590
referrals and also for internal IPS so

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,830
that employees from the internal network

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:37,680
do not need to authenticate

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:41,790
okay so but what about the competitors

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,370
you the question is why do we need to

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,250
implement all these features these are

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:52,230
only basic features from the beginning

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,750
interior some of the reasons you just

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,900
can look what is possible there are lots

00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:02,520
of products on the market but nearly

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:06,029
none of them is possible to serve videos

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,330
to internal networks and to the Internet

00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:12,180
either you choose one of those but never

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:16,170
the you got never product which can do

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,870
both of these also we need some really

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,160
flexible flexibility of the API that

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:27,020
means all of the content types within

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:33,870
our platform mass accessible via API

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:40,130
there must be the possibility to to

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,130
maintain all the content yeah

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,010
additionally we choose the trooper

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,570
solution because of the wide range of

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:53,430
add-ons and customer specific features

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,050
not all of the features are completely

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,670
clear at the beginning of the project

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,920
and so we are flexible enough to add

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,180
these add-ons later on

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:12,270
and at least from Germany so security of

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:14,760
the data is still one big point and our

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,800
customer wants to have the access to the

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,790
data they want don't want to have the

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,790
data outside of his own cloud

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,869
so this was the short introduction into

00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:33,379
features we can of course speak later on

00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:36,740
if you have interesting ideas or any

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:39,709
additional questions in July we'll go on

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,800
with our vision yes with the less

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:45,470
interesting part what is what is the

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,740
feature of that that we've built what is

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,819
yeah what is our vision where we should

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:55,519
go from now on we did an MVP with the

00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:57,290
most basic well like we take a customer

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,029
project said ok we need you to do it I

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,389
think you wanted to see if triple is the

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:04,790
right way to go the right solution for

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:07,839
this and we said yeah it is we saw that

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:11,540
it is that we have a long way to go and

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,079
the first thing we did we talked okay

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,959
we used for the implementation we used

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,040
one of the most flexible and powerful

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,579
content management frameworks out there

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,410
and open source and we said ok we love

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,360
people we love open source we want to

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,720
give back something to the community and

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,490
our vision is to do this as some other

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,600
Drupal or distributions are already

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,519
doing it and our vision is to make

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,370
devices functionality in two layers to

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,779
have Drupal distribution at the basis

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,629
where we provide the most important

00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:49,579
functionalities that we have here so

00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,529
this will be available entrepreneur Park

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,089
and we will have here the basic

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:59,230
configuration of the things that we saw

00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:02,420
right now like content types fields like

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,459
base team and things like this also the

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,429
video content management user management

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,410
that we have from Google core of course

00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:13,129
and also the abilities to add subtitles

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,649
to add chapters to be used also to have

00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:18,520
the channel possibilities and some basic

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:21,950
stats and then on top

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:26,240
more like a premium layer where where

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,670
you could buy some premium premium

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,390
features like the technology narration

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,040
or maybe are as your integration for

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,430
adaptive Petrella can play threat

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,440
encoding also password-protected or

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,950
possible as well thank you our separate

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,510
videos or total access to videos and on

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,120
top of that we are planning to have

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:52,090
support and hosting if you want to have

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,410
some kind of premium I don't know like

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:58,430
customer specific features to be

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,510
implemented or yeah and but this is all

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,730
only the the MVP that you have right now

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,120
and pass along back up a backlog of

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,480
ideas where we can go from now on and

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,200
this is what it could look like we can

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,420
see the our basic distribution is

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,120
getting the larger and larger and so

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,580
here are some ideas that we have the one

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,160
is for example trichology transcoding

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,910
services api currently we are using

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,270
Azure but the idea or the perfect the

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,220
perfect world will be to have some kind

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,510
of lovable API to have for example

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,490
logins for different transcoding

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,310
services say okay I want a sure or I

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,760
want it moving or I want maybe also

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,070
something local like at an impact

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,149
this would be a big thing to do and we

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,889
have some quick wins from Drupal from

00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:56,660
our beloved trooper for example

00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,949
commenting on videos this is something

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,399
like pretty straightforward to do and of

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:05,199
course

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,500
combine this with user profiles with

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,779
user images like profile images also

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,100
views of what I have uploaded all of the

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,130
things that we know about so from

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,470
YouTube also things like ratings and

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,019
abuse reported they could be very easily

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,180
implemented with the flack module and

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,110
also for a personal playlist this is

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,560
also things that we have on our agenda

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,850
or what is our idea and also another

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,579
thing that we're talking about is

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:38,060
subscriptions having subscriptions to

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:41,120
subscribe either to channels or to user

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,589
so if some new video is coming to this

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,190
channel I have subscribed I get

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:48,709
notification or Explorer two outer is

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,949
supporting a new video I am also getting

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:53,839
and also getting a notification and this

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,730
and another thing is of course sharing

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,500
but not sharing in social media because

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,760
we are a little bit in the more in the

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,560
enterprise world in the company and so

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,610
the idea would be here to share a video

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,949
with other users on the platform and on

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,100
the premium level we have some ideas of

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:17,420
using machine learning though we'll be

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,550
using the azure services to have fun as

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,160
for example face recognition so for

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,649
example with the CEO speaking some other

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,570
having a topic on this video we didn't

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:30,510
get a face recognition and then we can

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:34,410
to recommendation of or a list of other

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,300
videos where the CEO is also heading

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,930
talks or something like this another

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,390
thing is generate automatically generate

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:46,290
captions from the meat of the video so

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:49,200
that actor doesn't have to put to write

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,200
them down by theirselves and we can also

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,280
then automatically translate those in

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:59,310
different languages so yeah the idea for

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,460
the editor will be only pseudocode to be

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,070
you and everything will be there to back

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,400
to being magical and another thing also

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:11,220
a little bit combined is the

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,540
recommendation engine combined with the

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,260
machine learning but also to have

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:21,510
something like yeah similar videos like

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,910
this this is this is the idea we have to

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:30,000
of course find budget to do this

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:32,850
and we go to like finding customers and

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,920
yeah this is a tricky one this will be

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,870
the perfect world to do it and we'll be

00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:42,780
very happy if we can do it like this but

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:46,740
yeah we popped it we can do it yeah so

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,870
this is our vision and yeah we want to

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,050
announce it tank thank you for your

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,950
patient and for the attention and we are

00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:00,110
also open to all of your questions

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,110
and I have to also show this one

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,790
do you already have this does it have a

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,710
name

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:24,530
no we don't we don't have it this is the

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:29,330
plan this is the vision we have to stage

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:32,059
that robot right now is not finished

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,390
so we'll maybe need one or two more

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:37,370
sprints then the base teachers are

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,990
finished we can head over to the

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,230
customer and after that we start

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:48,030
completing operation right five ways

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:53,850
how to provide okay so you will publish

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:57,840
some things this would be a distribution

00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:01,580
actually right its configuration and

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,580
some custom modules and

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,260
look for their distribution it's not

00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,260
there

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:34,600
okay are you guys looking for

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:37,900
contributors to this project when we are

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,210
on the stage everywhere definitely we

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,510
will glad that people this is this is

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,810
also the romantic think of open source

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,580
right this is also when a customer pays

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,920
for something that maybe they can also

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,450
pay for some new features that we can

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,450
implement and all the other customers

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:58,890
and of the open source community can

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,890
also profit from this

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,360
yeah

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,910
another technique of taking credit

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,470
question about

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:25,950
the streaming server and

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:30,690
and coding service that you use you

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:35,119
design your your solution to comply

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,119
from formula

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,129
yes to be most comfortable to several

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:50,279
devices so that means we are including

00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:55,669
the directional video files - epic - and

00:20:50,279 --> 00:21:00,870
m3u8 manifests and we are also including

00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:04,889
like the entire - than the end 3u8 and

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,409
after that mp4 file to our players so

00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,539
that the mechanism behind can choose

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:13,919
what browser are you using what device

00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:18,870
are using and the user for 99 percent

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,490
will get a good video and after that you

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,720
can order without

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:28,409
Matteson chooses the quality basic is

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:33,470
the the bandwidth the users connected so

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:36,649
we try to make it like the most

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,649
comfortable way

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,970
[Laughter]

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:45,960
yes in the Explorer is working for the

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,740
key right now

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,740
okay

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,900
so thanks a lot

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,159
