Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: Pivot Points - Recognizing Opportunity, Turning Challenges to Strengths.
Publication date: 2019-10-29

Description: 
	Matthew Saunders
Self, Littleton, United States

Like many in our community, I came to opensource though a non-traditional path. In this session I will share my journey to open source technology professional from a beginning where my parents were told, while I was bright, I would never learn to read or write - my learning disabilities were considered too far a reach to allow it.

Through a series of pivots I learned to read and write, became an accomplished child vocalist, completed a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in Studio Art and minoring in Theatre, earned a certification in Non-Profit Management, went on to complete a Masters of Fine Arts in Theater and became a technology professional.

I metamorphosed.

At many points in my life, I was in the right place at the right time, grabbing opportunities where they could be found. Whether it was learning to read because I wanted to sing in a choir, or happening to be part of a crazy online project with a Dance company when the World Wide Web was in its nascent form, or pushing the boundaries of what an MFA in arts administration really ought to be - understanding those moments where your life pivots and taking full advantage of them can make the difference between success and failure.

Iâ€™ll also openly share my own pitfalls -- professional, medical, and academic. Any of them could have become a weak link in the chain that brought me to my current role, but I clawed my way through and kept going.

This session is directed at anybody who lives their professional life through the lens of:

* Imposter's Syndrome
* Having Learning Differences like dyslexia and ADD that challenge success
* Finding their way to Drupal in non-traditional ways and feels "different"
* A parent of a child with these kinds of challenges
* Surviving of an acute condition (I'm a cancer survivor) that impacts you professionally and personally

This will demonstrate:
* Recognition of your own moments when everything can pivot, in ways that will positively impact your life and career
* Realisation that perceived weaknesses can, in fact, be strengths
* Shared Experiences, I hope my experiences resonate with some of your own.

In the end, this will be a celebration of the diverse ways people can, and do come to amazing communities like ours.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,170
all right I'm gonna get started this

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,910
session is called pivot points

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,360
recognizing opportunities and turning

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,030
challenges into strengths and before I

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,120
get started I need to call it two family

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,199
members whose permission was essential

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,070
for me to be able to do this

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:25,529
presentation the first was my mother she

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,990
died of pulmonary fibrosis this spring

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,109
in the last few weeks of her life I

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,219
visited my parents and in that time she

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,770
helped me sort out details in my

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,960
childhood that that I needed to to have

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,149
sorted out for this presentation the

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,500
second is my daughter she doesn't

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,980
realize it yet but she's kind of a

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,780
superhero so the journey bullit that

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,309
begins with two young parents being told

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,620
that their youngest child was really

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,050
bright but despite that brightness I've

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,960
never overcome my learning disabilities

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,719
it's too far a stretch and I would never

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,100
learn to read or write my parents were

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,410
told that they should prepare that I

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,149
might never be independent and so

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,949
through a series of pivots I learned to

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,140
read and write I became an accomplished

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,650
child vocalist and completed a Bachelor

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,390
of Arts earned a certification in in

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,860
nonprofit management and went on to

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,420
complete a Master of Fine Arts in the

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,900
theater and eventually became a

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,880
technology professional at many points

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,740
in my life I was in the right place the

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,049
right time grabbing opportunities where

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,180
they could be found whether whether it

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,040
was learning to read because I wanted to

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,650
sing in a choir or happening to be part

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,509
of a crazy online project with a dance

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,369
company when the world wide web was in

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,590
its nascent form or pushing the

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,290
boundaries of what an MFA in arts

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,729
administration really ought to be

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,619
understanding those moments were your

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,759
life pivots and taking advantage of them

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,000
can make the difference between success

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,430
and failure when I was a small child

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,200
that means a small job when I was a

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,780
small child my parents discovered that I

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,310
was developmentally delayed in reading

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,509
and writing I was having a hard time

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,909
learning my ABCs

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,369
I was ridiculously hyper I was engaged

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,899
in obsessive and and repetitive

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,149
behaviors I had trouble understanding

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,069
what others were feeling although when I

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,160
was explained to me I was deeply in

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,480
pathetic yeah my vocabulary had to

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,830
develop too

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,980
to a degree which you wouldn't expect

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,050
from a child child month at age in

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,489
today's terms I would likely would have

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,030
been labeled in three ways

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:27,540
dyslexia attention deficit hyperactivity

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,650
disorder and Asperger's syndrome back in

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,390
the 1970s

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,250
doctors weren't well equipped to make

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,160
these kinds of diagnoses in fact

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,220
Asperger's wasn't recognized in Canada

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,590
until the mid 1990s so I was pinned down

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,330
as being a defiant child with what they

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,310
called a reversal problem short-term

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:49,049
memory problem and an extremely short

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,670
attention span my siblings and father

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,380
were part of a church choir

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,930
and I desperately wanted to be part of

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,140
that experience the choir master had me

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,349
read from a hymn book and I couldn't do

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,400
it he told me that until I could read I

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,099
couldn't join the choir and I was

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,190
inconsolable I felt stupid and I felt

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,959
left out but my father was an English

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,290
teacher and he sat down with me every

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,239
night writing letters sentences longer

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,130
sentences and eventually short stories

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,859
on the back of used dog matrix paper

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,920
that he got from work we spent several

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:25,200
months every night after supper grilling

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,579
and I went back to mr. Renner and asked

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,130
him to test me again and he was

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,019
incredulous because I had done so badly

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,799
ten weeks earlier and after the test he

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,480
invited me to join the choir if my

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,790
parents had taken it at face value that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,959
I'd never learned to read or write

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,329
perhaps I never would have managed it

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,130
however my choice to learn to read sent

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:49,739
me on a path where once I had my eyes on

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:52,079
a goal I could achieve it in 1977 eyes I

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,720
was identified as a high-risk child due

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,060
to delays and I hand coordination

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,269
spatial relations motor skills and

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,819
visual memory I had a massive vocabulary

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,440
an excellent word discrimination however

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,720
traditional learning was very difficult

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,489
for me it was recommended that you

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,500
should treat Matthew as if you were

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,980
hard-of-hearing and maintain eye contact

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,260
while giving moral instructions and his

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,419
a spent attention span is so short and

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,609
he is so easily distracted that it is

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,000
possible for him to not hear or retain

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,450
oral lessons my mind was quick to sort

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,310
out a problem though but I could only

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,950
some one thing at a time and often it

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,750
was obsessive my handwriting was

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,580
atrocious I would scramble letters up

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,660
and I had a hard time writing letters in

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,360
the correct direction

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,310
I had behavioral issues which included

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,310
some pretty angry outbreaks and in

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,580
retrospect I realized that I was having

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,920
significant challenges with transitions

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,900
crowds freaked me out and they actually

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,140
still do there's just too much stimulus

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,200
I also didn't understand consequences I

00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,440
didn't get that if I did action a that

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,550
there would be consequences B and he

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,560
didn't matter whether it was a good or

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,590
bad consequence I just simply couldn't

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,880
understand that that correlation and to

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,770
this day I have to think through

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,390
scenarios so I understand the

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,550
consequences of my actions

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,230
this happens incredibly quickly but I

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,750
have to think about it and I never

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,590
realized until adulthood that most

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,570
people just naturally extrapolate

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,960
consequences so learning to do this has

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,250
been critical to my success my parents

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,230
and educators at the time were seeking

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,970
ways supporting my needs and this was

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,190
challenging because I believed there was

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:38,930
a misunderstanding of what my symptoms

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:41,120
actually meant and how they intervene my

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,610
dad the teacher and my mother the nurse

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,650
worked with my teachers to start sorting

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,260
out ways to isolate me from distractions

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,030
and concentrate better as a result I

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,120
ended up being enrolled in both the

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,570
gifted and talented program and also

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,400
remedial classes in junior high this

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,460
meant I didn't fit in anywhere as I

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,900
transitioned from high to high school I

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,640
didn't fit in with the gifted kids

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,260
because I was in the remedial program

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,640
and I didn't fit in with the remedial

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,430
kids because I was in the gifted program

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,200
and the the kids that were sort of in

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,750
normal normal classes I didn't have

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,930
anything in common as well it was an

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,640
extremely lonely time for me this had

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,500
social impacts of its own that I didn't

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,500
that really didn't resolve until until

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,270
the university either but it did save me

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,890
from being relegated to being solely in

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,590
the remedial program which is what the

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,210
school wanted to do I didn't understand

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,580
this pivot point until much later in my

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,060
life but it quite likely saved me from

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,419
being

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,410
others for for the rest of my life so

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,660
parents of people with learning

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,750
differences need to demand educational

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,650
opportunities outside the mainstream

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,540
parents need to be willing to look

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,669
outside the box and find opportunities

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,070
for their children even when things seem

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:54,830
hopeless and never give up

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,510
this was impactful in two ways later in

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,550
my life the first was in my

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,100
transformation in University and the

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,930
second saved my daughter's life but in a

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,280
real way also helped me understand my

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,419
own when I finished high school I

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,919
recognized that I wasn't really ready to

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,020
go to university I wasn't mature enough

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,940
high school had been difficult and while

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,250
I had never failed any classes I had a

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,860
hard time concentrating and was socially

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,300
extremely awkward I didn't understand

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,970
people well and they didn't understand

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,130
me I misread ready intentions and was

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,260
often bullying for example I was taped

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,020
to the football posts goal goal posts

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,990
two feet off the ground in ninth grade

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,880
my locker was broken into and and a

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,040
snake a couple of crayfish and a field

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,710
pig from the biology lab were left in

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,570
their stinking Apple formaldehyde the

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,460
stigma from junior high had followed me

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,789
and I was alone believed and largely

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,169
without a tribe every success since then

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,690
has been colored with somebody's gonna

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,180
figure out that I'm worthless and this

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,120
is where for me imposter syndrome began

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,000
I felt happiest when I was able to do

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,460
things on my own things that required

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,789
repetitive actions this meant I was

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,440
excelled in art classes where repetition

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,570
with techniques like cross hatching were

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,490
valued I was able to express myself in

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,220
some pretty bizarre ways and rather than

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,160
being frowned on for it I was I received

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,930
praise I decided with the help of my

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
parents to take a vocational art program

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,530
for high school graduates and I worked

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,010
in a coffee shop at the same time but I

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,389
was really adrift my parents nor I had

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,320
any idea really what was gonna happen

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,270
next

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,310
I have heartedly engaged in that program

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,159
and left it before it was done I was

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:39,020
deeply sad I felt like a fake fraud and

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,409
useless but I was about to pivot and it

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,360
was a moment of ridiculously good luck

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,310
my father had seen an advertisement in

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,510
the local newspaper for a tiny liberal

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,880
arts university

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,620
Eastern Townships of Quebec the schools

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,500
nestled onto the convergence of two

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,210
rivers and was established in 1843 with

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,670
much of the architecture reflecting its

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,280
affiliation with Oxford and Cambridge

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,320
universities when we toured the school

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,320
it was immediately clear that the school

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,960
size only about 1700 students at the

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,610
time would be perfect I applied in fine

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,050
arts and theatre was accepted and

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,840
received several scholarships which

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,400
seemed crazy to me at the time my

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,970
largest class is about 40 people

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,530
smallest about seven and I started to

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,940
still the started school feeling a bit

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,410
like a fraud I was just waiting for

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,150
teachers to figure out that I really

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:30,610
didn't belong there for it all to fall

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,810
apart but it didn't and I flourished

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,280
remember when I said the social impacts

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,780
of being an experiment in mixing

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,060
remedial and gifted programs didn't

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,150
resolve until the University well when I

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,840
arrived nobody knew who I was I realized

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,330
that I could completely reimagine myself

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,890
without any of those stigmas at bishops

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,960
I learned that you can define your own

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,700
identity I learned that when you're

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,350
redefining yourself you might need to

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,730
fake it until you make it but all of

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,500
these things are in your control after

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,970
finishing my bachelor's degree I moved

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,220
back to Ottawa and moved as a lighting

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,750
tech for a local theatre I realized

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,950
while doing that lighting work that I

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,810
really didn't want to be a theatre

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,090
technician my whole life so I enrolled

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,890
in a nonprofit management program at the

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,890
University of Ottawa which led to a job

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,510
in an experimental dance company I'd

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,040
also applied to go to grad school in

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,550
Virginia to complete a Master of Fine

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,380
Arts focused on arts marketing that job

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,870
ended up being an enormous pivot and one

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,650
that I realized at the time and leverage

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,540
when I went to grad school it was 1995

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,130
and I was hired to work on the website I

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,580
quickly said sure I can figure that out

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,940
but in 1995 you didn't have Google to

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,290
Google what is a website I didn't know

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,630
what the internet was because I was

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,570
using to tell using telnet to log into a

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,760
crazy system called lambda mu and giant

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,310
freeform multi-user game and I actually

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,080
met my wife there I asked somebody on

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,860
lambda mu what this web thing was and

00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,040
suddenly I was a webmaster one of the

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,009
absolutely insane things that back

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,589
over the summer remember this is 1995

00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,329
was to collaborate in real time with

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,029
multiple dance companies in different

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,889
cities across Canada they were working

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,259
with the Canadian Broadcasting Company

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,240
to do live feeds between the different

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:19,630
sites and nobody had ever tried anything

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,930
like that collaboration at distance with

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,540
performers and it blew me away when air

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,060
arrives at Virginia Tech I explained to

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,829
my to my to my committee what I had seen

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,449
and my committee was incredible and

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,220
allowed me to gather together a

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:34,360
coalition of different departments to

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,670
experiment with leading-edge

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,920
technologies for my thesis work

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,079
so rather than researching the business

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,670
of the Arts doing doing marketing I was

00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,410
allowed to produce three works each

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,440
layering on the previous experimenting

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,110
with live-action stream live feeds and

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,579
pre-recorded video and that work was the

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,589
next pivot because I had to learn to

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:56,740
code to manage people to string together

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,089
networks to learn video codecs so the

00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,769
boy that wasn't supposed to learn to

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,709
read or write transformed into a

00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:04,000
technologist all of this led to my

00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:05,860
working with the university after

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,380
graduating teaching copyright law

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,610
videography developing what I think was

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,949
the first database-driven

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,240
tourism website with virginia tourism

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:18,760
board and this was back in 1998 there

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,649
are two parts to this lesson first of

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,720
all never be frightened to ask for what

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,550
you need in one the worst thing that can

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,220
happen is that somebody could say no to

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,339
you secondly don't be frightened to do

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,899
bold and crazy things do something that

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,790
takes you completely out of your comfort

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,079
zone and assume that if you keep

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,649
applying pressure to it

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,410
you will make it work be fearless and

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,389
don't let the perceive that the the

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,189
perceived consequence of failure

00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:50,079
you because the consequence of success

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:51,850
can be life-changing shortly after I

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,189
moved to Colorado to start my first

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,920
full-time professional job I discovered

00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,870
a lump in my last left testicle that

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,959
lump tripled in size over the space of

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,880
fifteen days I was off to surgery and

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,860
then chemotherapy I listened to

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,040
calculated and sorted out what to do in

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,070
a dispassionate way

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,900
well none consequences the chemo was

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,190
pretty dreadful at times and to this day

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,440
my hearing is affected

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,290
I have neuropathy in my fingertips and

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,090
permanent tinnitus in both ears it was

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,070
intense I was in the doctor's office

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,670
taking chemo through a port installed in

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,620
my chest

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,290
pretty much every day for two months I

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,870
brought a work flap talked to to the

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,160
clinic and spent my days coding when I

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,540
got home at night I would spend my

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,780
evening sweating curled up in a

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,850
miserable little ball remember when I

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,590
talked about my childhood though how I

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,810
was impulsive short-tempered at times

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,270
often inflexible obsessed by single

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,370
things in bad and transitions this

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,620
caused me to be impatient with people I

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,480
would often quibble about small details

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,490
and found it extremely difficult to let

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,840
those small details go often to the

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,240
detriment of my personal and

00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,860
professional relationships this

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,780
experience forced me to confront the

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,850
fact that small stuff doesn't matter

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,320
I learned that holding on to those kinds

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,990
of trifles and letting them stress you

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,640
out was counterproductive when I

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,530
completed my treatments and he met on

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,490
the other side that part of my

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:16,280
personality had changed for the better

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,800
in 1999 I joined a company called the

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,020
western states arts Federation it builds

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,730
software for other for other nonprofits

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,830
and is the senior director of technology

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,660
I was the architect for a job board and

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,220
loved LED developmentally and online

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,740
registers for artists writers and

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,720
performing artists I was the lead on the

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,550
software that is used by never nearly

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,010
every street art festival in the United

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,010
States to adjudicate artists to this day

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,020
I designed what I believe was the first

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:46,160
online grant making system and all this

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,830
was written in custom PHP in my MySQL in

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,990
2006 I attended the technology since a

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,880
symposium in Vancouver that included

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,610
participants from two of the first

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,620
Drupal shops in Canada at the time I

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,570
recognized in this pivot I knew that I

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,850
knew that Drupal at least for a time

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,350
could become a career in fact thirteen

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,140
years later it's still central to my

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,980
life later I attended a training session

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,470
Vancouver

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,230
with bright and rain City Studios I

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,110
started building my first site in Drupal

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,820
4.5 and came to the conclusion shortly

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,370
thereafter that I wanted to dive into

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,110
Drupal completely and I joined paint

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,170
vision a young Drupal agency in Boulder

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,300
Colorado a few weeks later I was at my

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,480
very first Drupal con in Barcelona

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,390
Barcelona was was a small Drupal con

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,830
only about 600 people but I became

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,470
friends with core members of the

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,180
community during that trip making those

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,730
connections became critical about two

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,260
and a half years later near the end of

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,240
my time with paint and I did a

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,920
presentation at Drupal con Paris and was

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,290
approached by chicks after it was done

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,870
he was pretty credit cryptic but said

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,320
that I should talk to Mike Meyers he was

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,670
one of the cofounders and now public

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,110
after that conversation with Meyers I

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,970
was invited to come on board with the

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,010
examiner.com team that was being formed

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,900
I was to Shepherd the largest Drupal

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,180
migration in history with people like

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,390
chicks most iris watt and Jeremy Andrews

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,850
our team actually built built 18 percent

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,160
of Drupal 7 and we did this while

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,870
migrating this site from ColdFusion we

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,450
were using MongoDB before it was out of

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:21,050
beta the project had no real right to

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,000
succeed but did I needed to be able to

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,410
manage or giant remote team I needed to

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,170
communicate and work with an executive

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,060
team sourced from Disney access and AOL

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,310
who had no experience in Drupal I

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,290
separated the consequence is good and

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,900
bad within the working relationship the

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,660
executive team and the dev team I didn't

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,430
focus on what could go wrong the entire

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,600
time I was working on Examiner I was

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,560
convinced that somebody was going to

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,330
figure out I didn't have the education

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,890
or the experience to have that job I

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,050
think that all of us though on that

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,670
project realized how is successful it

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,210
could become a launching point for many

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,380
careers and indeed that is what happened

00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,760
but the real thing that occurred near

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,710
the end of the project when Meyers

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,090
suggested that I ought handedly that I

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,240
should run for the Drupal Association

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:07,070
Board of Directors that pivot would

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,850
actually affect wouldn't actually affect

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:12,980
my career until about three years later

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,559
after a few years clear of the cancer my

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,419
wife and I decided that we wanted to

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,549
- child we'd always known that we wanted

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:19,959
to be parents we decided that we adopt

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,629
adopt through the foster care system

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,089
because so many terribly abused children

00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:27,909
in the United States need parents we

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:30,279
adopted a five year old girl she had had

00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:32,230
had very difficult few first few years

00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:34,299
of her life and had a lot of emotional

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,999
problems in many ways that mirrored my

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,190
own issues mine hadn't been born from a

00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:40,840
childhood of trauma but I did kind of

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,879
understood this kid and I'm not gonna go

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,529
into her stories but parenting this

00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,879
child has been the largest pivot of my

00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:48,100
life because I wouldn't understand my

00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:50,080
own challenges if I hadn't been

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,549
confronted with hers and had to learn

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,799
everything I could have been reactive

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,659
attachment disorder ADHD post-traumatic

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,970
stress disorder and most recently

00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:00,129
bipolar disorder if it hadn't been for

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,049
my daughter I would have just continued

00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:04,690
coping and I wouldn't have understood my

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,519
own ADHD and dyslexia and I certainly

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,289
wouldn't have had the explosive

00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,289
realization that I was on the spectrum

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,039
when I left the examiner I cycled

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:16,869
through a few jobs I did a short period

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,179
of time with trowing I worked with a

00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,340
small company called five ratings web I

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,110
joined at in design group and it was at

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,480
Adam that I ran for the drupal board of

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,919
sensi association board of directors and

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,499
I was elected and served for two and a

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,470
half years I sat on the board with Mike

00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:34,990
lamb he was from Pfizer and had a large

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,210
drupal team Micra represents the next

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,549
pivot in my story there are three

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,379
convergences that made this moment work

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,929
I knew that my time with that and was

00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:46,149
wrapping up I was at the second Drupal

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,740
con hosted in Barcelona and there was a

00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,049
Drupal association board meeting which

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,580
meant Mike was there I asked Mike if I

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,929
could bounce some ideas off of him I

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,330
wanted to talk to him about where my

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,129
career might go next and he and I met

00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,570
over a couple of drinks talked for

00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:00,730
several hours and at the end of it he

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,669
said something like Matthew I have some

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,340
ideas what you could do for me I'll be

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,940
in touch in a few weeks that pivot has

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,379
occurred exactly four years ago I was

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,730
brought onto the team as an engineering

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:14,980
lead for the healthcare professional

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,820
portal system in Drupal 7 utilized

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,740
worldwide impacting people everywhere so

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,029
you should build friendships and bridges

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,250
at every point in your life because

00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:27,159
those friendships become vehicles to

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,670
your success never be afraid to talk to

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,950
those

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,500
about what you need every job I've had

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,030
for nearly 22 years has come meat that

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,130
to me because I asked her it through

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:41,230
through my network now now you know how

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,000
a kid that was never supposed to learn

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,370
to read or write went from his first

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,720
goal of being a chorister to being a

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,820
senior manager at one of the largest

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,340
companies in the world

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,200
so I've some takeaways for you when

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,880
working with your children do not set

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,250
expectations through the lens of what

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,390
others tell you let your children fail

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,370
forward

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:04,120
let them be fearless and when they seem

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,250
adrift be present but don't dictate when

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,690
you perceive your weaknesses what you

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,940
perceive your meet weaknesses to be

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,530
might well be hidden strengths for

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,990
example being on the spectrum drives me

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,210
to be a nerd and everything that I set

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,920
myself to figure out having ADHD has

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,930
allowed me to focus on many things at a

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,660
time and my dyslexia has given me

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:25,600
insight into how to teach and learn

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,910
differently what seems like personal

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,460
disasters at the time like cancer can

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,670
have a positive impact in your life look

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,430
for the good not for the bad and finally

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,740
impostor syndrome is real no matter how

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:42,910
successful you are and lots of us have

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,860
it so have empathy for others I hope my

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,460
stories have resonated for you I thank

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:51,130
you for listening and if you like my

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,460

the site thank you very much and I think

I might have a minute for further

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,020
questions if anybody has questions if

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,600
not I'm happy to mean people over coffee
