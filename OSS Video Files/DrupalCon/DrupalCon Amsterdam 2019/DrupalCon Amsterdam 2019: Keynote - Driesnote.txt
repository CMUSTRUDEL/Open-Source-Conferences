00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:19,710
my first one I learned how to contribute

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,930
to port by sitting next to Karen s at my

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,939
first sprint but actually I could sit

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,189
next to them meet them and they met me

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,990
as an equal or miss it it felt like hey

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,070
I'm getting old was that all Dennis it

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,070
was like oh yeah I can do that

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,620
I wanted to be here to talk food the

00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,140
most amount of people I think it's

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,720
always less an issue to approach someone

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,530
and ask in person it is always less

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:56,369
intimidating come in come Undine

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:56,369
[Music]

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,720

serving as the executive director of the

welcome you to this event every Drupal

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,000
con event provides the opportunity for

00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,010
our community to learn connect and be

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,900
inspired how many of you are here at

00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,910
your first Drupal con me too this is my

00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,740
first official Drupal con and I get to

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,010
spend it with the European community so

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,590
I'm very excited to be here in Amsterdam

00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,210
of course large events like this could

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,160
never happen without a large number of

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,360
volunteers so we wanted to thank those

00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,330
that have given their commitment and

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,750
dedication to this event in particular

00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,840
our European Advisory Committee many of

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,310
these faces you see on almost all of the

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
committee's that have anything to do

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,369
with Drupal con and things that happen

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,380
here in the community it's because these

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,880
these individuals are so committed to

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,300
Drupal in the community and we want to

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,300
thank them

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,860
we also have a large number of track

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,450
team members and of course volunteer

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,470
coordinators that make all of this go

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,480
smoothly some similar phases that you

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,970
saw before I wanted to take a moment to

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,140
recognize the individuals that held the

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,420
splash Awards last night

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,670
standing-room-only event very very

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,800
successful but what's really important

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,050
about it is it's organized entirely by

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,910
volunteers so these individuals have put

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,160
in a lot of time and energy to make it

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,840
happen and what's very special about the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,430
splash awards is it starts to move

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,500
forward the marketing effort to the

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,090
business community around Drupal so what

00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,680
they're doing is very important and we

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:06,360
thank them and congratulate them in an

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:08,310
awesome event last night I'd like to

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,200
thank our Drupal con sponsors so while

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,840
it takes a ton of volunteers to do this

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,970
it also takes a ton of money so thank

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,260
you to their funding we're able to have

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,630
affordable ish tickets to Drupal con and

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,340
they also not only sponsor events like

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,980
this but they also have outstanding

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,110
services and solutions they provide to

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,570
the Drupal community itself so if you

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,850
would take a moment go through the

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,130
exhibition hall today find these

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,019
companies and tell them thank you for

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,320
what you do to bring Drupal con to

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,320
Europe

00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,210
I would like to send a special thank you

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,650
to our new partner in event production

00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,440
quo nee Congress

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,180
thanks to their partnership we have a

00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:03,100
new format and we were able to bring

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:05,080
DrupalCon back to Europe this year so

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,060
one thing I've learned in my four months

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,430
here in the Drupal community is that

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,290
you're passionate and have opinions so

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,300
we want to make sure you have an

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,610
opportunity to share those with us it is

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,050
a new format a new partnership and we

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,120
want to learn for next time

00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,460
so you can not only provide feedback on

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,170
the individual sessions themselves but

00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,670
we've got two opportunities you can

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,580
provide feedback in person at the

00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:33,130
debrief Boff or online and at the survey

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,870
link that you see here so everything

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,120
that we do at the Drupal Association is

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,300
a combination of volunteer support

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
sponsor support and staff support and I

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,600
wanted to take this opportunity to

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
publicly thank and recognize our amazing

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,310
team though they are paid resources I

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,770
assure you they work many many hours

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,510
above and beyond to make sure that our

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,730
Drupal community has a fantastic

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,690
experience this is a great team and I'm

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,690
thrilled to be with them

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,650
I would be remiss if I did not take a

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,600
moment to recognize our board of

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,850
directors led by Adam Goodman our board

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,560
chair these individuals provide

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,060
outstanding thought leadership and

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,830
strategic planning that helps our

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,720
organization drive the mission forward

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,720
so thank you Board of Directors I

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,320
promise you won't have to clap the whole

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,360
time contribution is what it's all about

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,070
right so all the work we do at the

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,780
Association is to enable you the

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,570
community to drive the Drupal project

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,510
forward we'd like to recognize some of

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,400
the contributors to the Drupal project

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,050
top individual contributors the list is

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,750
too long for me to read individually but

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,840
we wanted to have have them get their

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,880
moment of recognition and also top

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,050
organizational contributors without whom

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,390
we would not be able to drive the

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,300
project forward so we looked at a little

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,440
data and because of what came out of the

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,920
results I thought you would be

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,110
particularly interested Europe is the

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,120
largest contributor by region to the

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,120
Drupal project so thank you

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:15,569
the European community is a huge asset

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,189
to the Drupal project we wanted you to

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,810
get your due recognition and bragging

00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,669
rights that you can share for at least a

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,870
year until the rest of the world gets

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:29,969
jealous and tries to catch up yeah boo

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,770
and speaking of contribution if you've

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,930
never had a chance to contribute to the

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,939
project before or you'd like to do more

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:40,770
of it we have opportunities every day

00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:42,779
here at Drupal con so the Drupal

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,580
Association is always existed to bring

00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,979
the community together to build Drupal

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,590
but increasingly the association has

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,750
become essential to Drupal itself over

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,029
the past few years our small but mighty

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,520
engineering team has taken on more and

00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:02,159
more work and now manages a significant

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:04,169
number of drupal services if you haven't

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,939
done so already I encourage you to join

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,249
our ongoing individual membership

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,379
campaign you can join while you're here

00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:12,719
at the conference join us at booth 3 if

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,400

help you with that you can join at the

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,740
booth or online so promote Drupal is an

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,949
initiative I hope most of you have heard

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,779
about but one of the things that I hear

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,939
very often in the Drupal community is we

00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,719
have a need to better promote and market

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,520
the Drupal project now to that end the

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,169
promote Drupal initiative was created

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,509
where we brought together volunteers

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,610
sponsors from around the world to create

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,639
resources like the video and brand book

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,319
the idea was we wanted to give materials

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,149
so that anyone anywhere in the world

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,149
could effectively share the word about

00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:58,310
Drupal you can find those materials and

00:07:54,149 --> 00:08:00,779
start to utilize them today at this site

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,819
thank you to the top contributors of the

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,560
promote Drupal project thanks to

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,560
individuals and companies we are able to

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,629
bring that initiative to life if you'd

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,819
like to be involved we are in need of

00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,889
volunteer translators so that we can

00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,019
take the case study slides and better

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,849
share them around the world if you would

00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,759
like to join this effort or submit your

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:21,480
own case study you can do so here or you

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,070
can contact

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,750
at the Drupal Association for more

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:29,550
information there's true power in the

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,770
events and activities that happen at the

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,840
local level so Drupal con is not the

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,530
only place for our Drupal community to

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,660
get together

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,460
and guidance in making the Charter a

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,130
reality so if you get a moment tweet

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,130
them say good job thank you and get

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,170
involved and if you organize local

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,780
events or would like to organize local

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,250
events you can contact us at the Drupal

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,140
Association and we'll get you connected

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,820
to this group as well here are just a

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,950
few of the events coming up in the

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,260
region if you would like to get more

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,330
detail or see events that are happening

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,850
all around the world you can find them

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:53,250
at Drupa Cal calm so I mentioned the

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,900
event sponsors but there's also work

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,790
that we do year-round and so one of the

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,470
most important programs at the Drupal

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,320
Association is our supporting partner

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,180
program I'd like to thank our supporting

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,430
partners this program in particular

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,860
funds drupal.org in our Drupal

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,360
Association engineering team all the

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,430
great work our team is doing to maintain

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,740
and improve the drupal.org user

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,690
experience would not be possible without

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,230
these supporters who give funding to

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,760
last throughout the year as you'll see

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,520
there's a lot of overlap between

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,400
supporting partners event sponsors

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,020
volunteers contributors and that's the

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,130
kind of ecosystem that's going to make

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:35,220
Drupal successful so it Drupal con

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,199
Vienna in 2017 Driss proposed May

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,870
automatic updates one of the strategic

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:41,910
initiatives for the Drupal project

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,279
throughout 2018 members of the community

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,930
along with the Drupal Association

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,120
developed an architectural plan and

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,009
began brainstorming how we would get the

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,160
resources required to actually do what

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:55,980
trees told us to do always the first

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,740
challenge so that's where the European

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,240
Commission comes in early last year the

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,370
European Commission partnered with the

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,339
Drupal Association to find to the first

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:14,360
phase of this project let's take a look

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:17,360
at the progress we've made this year in

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
theory

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:30,220
this is going well first time okay

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,470
here's what we'll do come find me at the

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,420
Drupal Association booth I'll play the

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,920
video for you we'll talk about automatic

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,170
updates but what you would have meant

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,760
what you missed was Tim narrating a

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,460
video about all the awesome work that's

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,710
been done around automatic updates today

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:54,070
the good news is that phase one should

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:55,570
be stable by the end of the year his

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,130
first place of work supports Drupal

00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,630
seven and eight users to install their

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,510
sites by downloading an archive from

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,370
drupal.org phase one includes displaying

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,680
Drupal PSAs directly in the admin panel

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,500
running automated readiness checks and

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,060
performing in-place updates this phase

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,550
does not support database updates

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,870
contribs

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,270
installs those features are on the

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,980
roadmap for phase two we want to thank

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,390
all of the organizations and individuals

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,010
who've contributed to phase one of this

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:26,470
initiative let's look at a demo here you

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,360
can see a Drupal 8 site on version 8.7

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,160
dot 4 so it's definitely out of date

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,670
let's see what the automatic updates

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,470
module can provide we go into the

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,720
automatic updates configuration you can

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,310
see the PSA feature which pulls public

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,050
safety announcements from Trueblood org

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,780
and displays them directly in the admin

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,100
interface these PSAs can also be

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,930
automatically emailed to the site

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,850
administrator as configured in the

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,500
update manager next we can run a

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:58,030
readiness check to see if our site can

00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,010
be automatically updated safely if the

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,440
checks are unsuccessful we might see a

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,330
number of warnings and errors these

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,550
issues are most commonly caused by file

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,920
permissions problems or by patching core

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,710
contributes and must be resolved before

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,600
you can use automatic updates the

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,160
readiness checks are successful we see a

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,130
green message you can proceed with the

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,660
update finally we can see an

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,910
experimental option to trigger the

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,500
concise update let's see what happens in

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,150
the background on the automatic updates

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,190
module is giving an update package from

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,170
drupal.org which contains all the file

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,180
changes for this update and

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,430
it's over laying them on the site as we

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,889
see here that update was successful site

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,720
is now updated to version 8.7 date once

00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,310
the automatic updates module is stable

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,170
this initial work can help protect a

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,420
large number of small to mid-size Drupal

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,970
sites especially those on Drupal 7 but

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,500
what's on the way in phase 2 phase 2

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,089
will add a system to create a be

00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,769
versions of a site enabling us to

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,440
building robust support for composer

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:05,320
ample database updates and to extend

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,940
support to contributed projects phase 2

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,709
needs your help so if you're interested

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,160

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,630
to us at the Drupal Association so we'll

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
hit the punch line one more time for

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,680
emphasis the automatic update module

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:25,570
created for phase 1 will be stable by

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:28,779

join us in discussion here it's an

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,649
important topic generally this idea of

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,360
how do we create an ecosystem a

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,589
technology ecosystem that encourages

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,029
more participation in Drupal but also

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,220
encourages whether its existing people

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,839
who are considering Drupal 8 and the

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,339
future of Drupal or people who are

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,589
perhaps for the first time considering

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,020
Drupal how they come and participate in

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,780
this community and in this project and

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,240
so we're very committed to that we made

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,360
an important acquisition earlier this

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,949

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,750
minute walk and we'd love you to come

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:31,850
and join us have some fun meet people

share your stories I enjoy a drink a

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,350
little bite to eat and generally connect

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,520
with everybody this evening after what

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,130
would have been a very very busy day

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,750
this is close by it's it's just I think

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,200
it's as I say about five minute walk

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,480
here

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,650
and you're all welcome so if you need

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,900
more information about where there are

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,730
some flyers that we have out in the main

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,280
pavilion we can tell you about it but

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,440
hopefully you can see details here all

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,870
right so those are the things we wanted

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,900
to share with you this morning I have

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,330
the pleasure of introducing your keynote

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,410
speaker and I was thinking in fact this

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,880
morning he's to me he said you've known

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,370
me quite a while I have I've known him

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,330
about seven and a half eight years and

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,920
we were thinking about what's the story

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,070
I'm going to tell and I have so many fun

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,940
stories but I'm not going to share one

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,160
here they're fun I have a plenty of them

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,750
and they're all good so if you can come

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,400
and find me later I will share some but

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,740
nothing too embarrassing on stage here

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,700
so look let please join me in welcoming

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:33,119
our friend and our colleague Rhys

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,119
[Applause]

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:58,760
[Music]

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,990
all right they're trying to get me to

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,980
dance it would be a bad idea

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:11,750
um maybe tonight at the party yeah maybe

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:13,850
maybe anyway it's good to be back in

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,080
Amsterdam you know I think it's a third

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,790
time we have a DrupalCon

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,610
in Amsterdam which I think makes it the

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,580
number one DrupalCon city which is

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,100
pretty exciting yeah it's also exciting

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,230
for me is this is actually the first

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:34,880
time my kids and my parents are

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:36,080
attending a DrupalCon so I know yeah you

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,500
know in all these years and actually

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,690
Drupal predates my kids but in all these

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,850
years they haven't attended one so I'm

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,400
very excited to have them just you know

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,830
they're really into getting stickers so

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,570
if you see them running around kids with

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,540
love stickers not sure about my parents

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,880
they may they may want stickers too but

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,110
you know they speak for my parents

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,740
anyway we have a lot to cover so I'm

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,660
gonna jump right in three big topics

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,940
today that I want to talk about is one I

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,559
want to give you an update on Drupal

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,570
eight point eight which is our next

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,910
release I want to talk a little bit

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,559
about nine and how ready we are for

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,480
Drupal 9 and then I want to look forward

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
and talk a little bit about what comes

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,970
once we release Drupal 9 you know what

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,280
should we be working on so I'll be kind

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,770
of diving in to a little bit of product

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,840
strategy for Drupal 9 if you will so it

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,240
should be pretty exciting and so let's

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:34,820
start with the Drupal 8.8 update so as

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,540
some of you may know we've already cut

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,800
an alpha release so we're currently

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,500
stabilizing eight point eight and our

00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,040
goal is to release Drupal eight point

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,650
eight

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,590
by December 4th so it's about a month

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,970
away right so I can tell you and I'm

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,240
gonna walk you through all of it that

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,010
it's literally jam-packed with a lot of

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,730
great new features I don't think we've

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,670
had this many new things in a release as

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,830
8.8 so I think it's a huge testament to

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,990
some of the acceleration and

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,720
contribution that we're seeing so very

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:13,310
very exciting so as a quick reminder

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,040
the way we're working on Drupal 8 is

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,540
along these four strategic tracks is

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,100
what I call them right we're trying to

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,590
get up to the mountain at the top of the

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,990
mountain the summit and to get there we

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,390
are working on these four things and for

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,240
each of those four strategic tracks we

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,810
have a number of initiatives and in

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,950
total we have 13 of these initiatives so

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,170
I'm not gonna walk you through all of

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,180
them right now but I'm gonna go track by

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,820
track and give you a very quick update

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,790
on some of the progress that we have

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,970
been made in making so let's start with

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:50,300
the first track which is all about

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,000
making Drupal easier for about content

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,370
creators and for side dollars all right

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,250
so the two initiatives that I'm gonna

00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,070
highlight our media and the

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,150
administration UI lots of great progress

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:07,700
the media hopefully all of this will get

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:11,900
finalized before 8.8 but I can tell you

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,510
that media in Drupal is better than ever

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,490
before and so the best way for you for

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:20,840
me to show you is by playing a very

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,160
quick video if you happen to see the

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,830
media demo in Seattle

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,290
you remember that starting in Drupal 8.7

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,800
Drupal shipped with a media library that

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,840
enables editors to create reusable media

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,820
Drupal 8.8 takes that a step further and

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,580
allows you to easily embed media in a

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,230
text field in this animation we are

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,600
browsing the media in our library

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,300
selecting an image and embedding it in

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,430
text by default the alternative text

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,500
description for the image is inherited

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,120
from the media library but we can

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,760
override it if it doesn't make sense in

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,380
this context and of course just like

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,170
when uploading images the old way

00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,120
without media library it is possible to

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,070
align and caption media no matter if

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,220
it's an image a video or something else

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,640
last but not least we're able to do all

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,610
of this using only the keyboard

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:17,360
[Music]

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:18,980
yeah yeah very exciting because I don't

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,630
know if given these updates before but

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,400
the media initiative we've broken up in

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,380
these chunks and you know first we have

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,360
to make some things better in core and

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,920
then we were able to add a media library

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,200
and now we've finally been able to do

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,540
the integration with the WYSIWYG so if

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,330
we complete is that gonna wraps up the

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:38,840
media initiative as as we said we would

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:42,470
do so lots of great improvements I can

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,830
also say that Drupal has a never looked

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:48,380
better so we have another initiative

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:52,130
which is to redesign the administrative

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,929
UI of Drupal it's a project called Claro

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,120
it's the name of a theme that we've been

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,740
developing and it really meant for you

00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,480
know content creators and site builders

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,570
it's on the backend of Drupal so again

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,700
let me play your video and show you some

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:09,140
of the progress that we've made on the

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,760
claro project the main goal of this

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,559
project was to refresh the look and feel

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,910
of the administrative UI's or a tuple

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,299
will be perceived as a more modern

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,919
platform I'm going to start with the

00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,590
plain installation of the Pournami demo

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,590
installation profile here you can see

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,299
how Drupal looks in its current state B

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,299
fur gloves of feedback that the current

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,380
ripple administered UI looks kinda round

00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,790
this is for the most part due to the

00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,490
fact that this was designed ten years

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,610
ago back in 2009 and it has only

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,200
received some minor update since then

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,150
next let's enable borrow our new

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,210
outcoming administration D I think a

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,590
look at how much better things will be

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,120
so the first thing you will notice is

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,679
the power users much cooler color

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,929
palette with more contrast

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,669
it looks more modern and is easier to

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,880
use for people with visual impairments

00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:57,919
in this project we've decided the mainly

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,500
focus on the visual look at filter as

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,919
well as accessibility we are making only

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,390
a limited number of functional changes

00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,590
we've redesigned and implemented all of

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,400
the components for basic site

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,950
configuration

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,960
and authoring content in a site we've

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,430
done user testing on the designs and the

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,710
peeper has been overwhelmingly positive

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,330
it makes a big difference to content

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,570
creators and site builders who spend

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,010
hours a day working in the Drupal site

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,810
the team has also focused on ensuring

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,880
that the new team works well on all

00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,500
types of devices you have automatic

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,030
tolling the helplessness response or

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,490
comfortability and responsive view

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,290
models we've also increased the size of

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,030
site controls such as buttons and feels

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,820
to ensure that they are easy to use on

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,350
mobile

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,910
floor is also designed and built this

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,850
apartment does like hundreds more out of

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,530
the box this is a type of assistive

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,050
technology decided to help users with we

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,610
shall increment here you can see how

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:56,030
Clara look slides are viewed on windows

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:57,080
high contrast mode next let's take a

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,660
look at some of the accessibility

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,910
improvements we've made first I'm going

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,410
to navigate using a keyboard this is

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,620
often used by users with motor

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,090
disabilities or visual impairment we've

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,500
ensured that there are always strong

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,000
indicators for what the user is

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,100
currently focusing on to page

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,050
we've also ensured that the focus isn't

00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,370
only indicated with color to make sure

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,540
that users with colorblindness can

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,540
recognize the focus in fact

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,550
it's awesome I love the detail -

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,830
accessibility through to our commitment

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,990
to make Drupal the most accessible CMS

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,380
so all of this is experimental right now

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:44,050
in 8.8 hopefully we can get it stable

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:48,429
for Drupal 9 which would be pretty

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:50,740
amazing timing all right so that's a

00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:53,950
very quick update on the first track so

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,570
let's move on to the next track before I

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,220
do that there is other items on this

00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,140
track other initiatives on this track

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,000
and we've also made great progress on

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,530
those I'm just you know not covering

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,270
them today I've covered them in the past

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,429
and will hopefully cover them in the

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,800
future but lots of great progress and

00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,910
the workflow initiative also great

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,640
progress on the layout builder

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,340
initiative they're actually expanding

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,660
the scope of the layered builder to

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,720
essentially layout everything the whole

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,929
page not just sort of the note piece if

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,740
you go so moving on to the next track

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:28,690
which is all about reducing the total

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,980
cost of ownership for developers and

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,710
site owners and there's a lot of

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,720
initiatives on this track as well again

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:38,490
we made progress across the board so I'm

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,350
going to cover a few of them real quick

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,320
the fit the first initiative is the

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:47,200
composer initiative lots of great

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,590
progress in Seattle a bunch of people

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,240
somehow really I don't know what to say

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,700
here but like they really got like

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,980
moving on this initiative and I was

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,140
telling Greg and actually Ryan - I read

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,200
every commit message and the number of

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,600
commit messages around composer has gone

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,330
through the roof so big thank you to all

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,580
of the contributors behind the composer

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,190
initiative so let me explain a little

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,170
bit what composer is obviously the goal

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,210
as you can read on the screen is to make

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,059
it really easy to not just install

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,270
Drupal but also update rupal that's

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:25,210
important because in Drupal 8 we now use

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,980
a lot of third-party libraries and it

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,360
becomes hard to manage all of these

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,980
libraries and to figure out which

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,920
library do you have to update 1

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,929
similarly modules have dependencies on

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,660
each other as well so if you need module

00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:40,580
a you may have a dependency in module B

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,360
and not just any version of module B but

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,279
specific version like maybe version 2

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,630
and so it's really composers job to help

00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,549
you orchestrate all of these

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:55,190
dependencies and do the update for you

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:57,500
to date our composers report wasn't

00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,500
awesome you know let's be honest it

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,510
wasn't good enough and part of the

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,210
challenge was that people needed to

00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,580
install some contribute modules or even

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,279
build some custom codes to really manage

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:14,059
composer well and so that has a couple

00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:18,110
of issues obviously it's not as reliable

00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:21,919
right because using composer isn't

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:24,919
covered by you know the core testing

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,840
process in the core release process it

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,029
was also hard because there isn't one

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,190
official way to do things there's a

00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,529
number of different ways to use composer

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,750
that way and last but not least it

00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:37,580
wasn't properly or fully integrated with

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,250
Drupal the doric either so we couldn't

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,409
take the full advantage of composer

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,510
because we didn't have true semantic

00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:48,529
versioning not going to go into all of

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:50,389
the details here but so but we could do

00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:52,669
better right and so we made a plan on

00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:54,169
how to fix of some of these things and

00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:57,679
really what we've done is we've moved

00:30:54,169 --> 00:31:00,289
some of these country but abilities into

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,570
poor and you know made them better along

00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:05,570
the way but the result is that you no

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,809
longer need to install these contribute

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,450
modules the result is also that there's

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:14,240
one clearly recommended way of using

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:18,620
composer with Drupal the one way which

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:22,519
is really really useful core itself can

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,860
now employ composer best practices we

00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,260
have full integration with Drupal the

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,460
doric thanks to the work in the

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,669
collaboration with the Drupal

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,429
Association and so all of this will ship

00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:38,269
with eight point eight which is pretty

00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:40,070
tremendous progress and so but you'll be

00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,549
able to do with Drupal eight point eight

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:46,580
is literally update and install Drupal

00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:49,549
with one command you can see the

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:52,130
commands here on the screen now not

00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:54,789
everybody might be ready to start using

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:58,149
composer and that's okay too

00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:00,669
old mechanism if you will using tarballs

00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:03,429
and you can download will continue to be

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:06,789
supported and we're also working on

00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:08,440
adding composer support to these tar

00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:09,999
balls so what that means is that if you

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,989
want to start with a tar ball and then

00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:14,199
in the future

00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:16,119
switch to composer that will be easy to

00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:19,089
do right so we're not there yet but

00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,359
that's what the team is working on and

00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:24,369
so tremendous progress so you know

00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:31,809
quickens applause for the composer

00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:36,639
initiative yeah so what's better than

00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:39,489
one-step upgrades zero step upgrades and

00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:41,859
so that's already automatic updates

00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:44,139
initiative comes in Heather already

00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,269
showed you a demo so I'm not gonna you

00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:47,919
know talk about it again but you know

00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:49,329
thanks for the European Commission and

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,079
all of the other people that helped with

00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:57,639
this I personally think it's pretty

00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:59,319
magical to see it is you know coming to

00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,839
life I really do think it's one of the

00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:04,479
biggest things that's holding Drupal

00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,789
back when I talk to people the fact that

00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:08,589
it can be hard to upgrade Drupal means

00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:10,690
it's expensive sometimes to upgrade

00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:13,419
rupal which really doesn't make it a

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,940
good choice for many organizations so

00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,709
I'm excited about the automatically

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,419
updates initiative I think we should

00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,889
keep working on it we should figure out

00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,539
how to integrate it with the composer

00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:27,009
initiative and all of these things but

00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:28,449
really good progress we've also made a

00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:30,249
really good progress on the

00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:32,799
configuration management initiative

00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:35,559
we've actually added some capabilities

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,619
from contribute core just like with

00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,369
composer which allows site builders or

00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:45,279
developers to exclude certain modules

00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:46,929
from their deployments and not just the

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,119
modules but also the configuration that

00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:52,029
comes with these modules so that's

00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,069
really useful for example when you have

00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,059
a development staging production

00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:59,469
environment it allows you to exclude

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:02,369
sort of configuration or modules that

00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:05,109
aren't intended for production right so

00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:07,269
that's all being done on through an API

00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,500
and so as a developer you can you know

00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:11,590
use that API

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,780
to you know get more fine-grained and

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,990
more precise about configuration so

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,030
really exciting as well so that's a very

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:23,800
quick update on some of the progress on

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:25,929
on this strategic track last track is

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,169
actually to keep Drupal relevant and

00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,970
impactful and we've already tackled the

00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:32,980
six-month feature releases we're doing

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,970
that well it's I mean we're shipping on

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,820
time

00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,919
hopefully with 8.8 that certainly we

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,020
shipped eight point seven eight point

00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:44,379
six eight point five all of the releases

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:47,169
like clockwork and so that was what that

00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:49,929
initiative was all about but the API

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:53,020
first initiative is another important

00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:55,030
initiative a lot of the world is moving

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,980
to headless and decoupled architectures

00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,530
I'll talk a little bit more about that

00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:03,730
in a second but that initiative has

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:06,520
always us also I should say continue to

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:10,810
make a lot of great progress so in my

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,670
humble opinion Drupal 8 is already one

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,490
of the best headless solutions in the

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:18,460
market and certainly the best adjacent

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:22,390
API based solution and with some of the

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,610
progress that we've seen lately Drupal 8

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,550
continues to be better and better and

00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:30,550
better at being a decoupled solution a

00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,860
lot of that innovation is happening in

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,800
the contribute module space all the way

00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,630
from documentation improvements to what

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,230
we call interactivity improvements

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:43,630
through a visual Explorer as well as

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,880
performance improvements I'm gonna show

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:50,170
you real quick some of the progress that

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:53,410
we have made so first we can auto

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,690
generate documentation from the code

00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:59,020
which is really helpful for helping

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:03,190
people figure out how to use the JSON

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,880
API that ships with Drupal documentation

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,240
looks great

00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,150
I think but again what's better than

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,990
having that kind of documentation is to

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:16,900
really help people you know create these

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:19,360
JSON API queries if you will through a

00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,000
visual tool so today that can be a

00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,299
little bit hard for example if you want

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,369
to add

00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:28,660
drupal you know it's sort of in the

00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:32,499
orange box you have to handcraft a URL

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:35,019
like the one you can see in the in the

00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:37,299
black box so obviously that's not very

00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:39,759
intuitive for organizations or for

00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:43,059
people to do right and so we've worked

00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:45,609
on making that a lot easier and so we

00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:48,849
built something which we call the json

00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:52,689
api explorer and allows organizations or

00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:56,259
individuals to very quickly you know

00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:58,630
visually constrict these kinds of you

00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:06,880
know queries so i have a video to play

00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:08,019
for this as well i run a website for a

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,689
local sports league

00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:14,309
it's a decoupled react application using

00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:16,900
Drupal's json api as its back-end API

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:18,939
one of the pages in the react front-end

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,699
needs to display all of the players who

00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:23,410
are members of a certain team Drupal is

00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:25,299
great at modeling this kind of content

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,069
it makes for the ideal back-end

00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:28,989
especially because I can get that

00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:32,859
information from Drupal through its JSON

00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:34,420
API web service today figuring out the

00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,549
exact structure of a query can be

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,219
cumbersome so we have been working on

00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:42,640
making this radically easier please meet

00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:45,400
the JSON API Explorer instead of having

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,799
to craft JSON API queries manually you

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,349
can now use a visual in browser query

00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,880
builder if you've used graph QL in the

00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,819
past this is something you might have

00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,679
used graphical for the JSON API Explorer

00:37:54,819 --> 00:38:01,239
aims to fill this gap when using JSON

00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:03,329
API a link on the JSON API configuration

00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,979
screen takes me directly to the Explorer

00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:08,199
here I can easily start building my

00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:11,469
query by selecting the content type I

00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:13,329
want to include adding a relationship to

00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:16,150
the players teams and filtering by a

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:20,049
team ID and sorting by the players last

00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:22,239
names each interaction with the Explorer

00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:24,099
has updated the query in the address bar

00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,929
at the top when I'm happy with the

00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:27,820
results I can copy and paste this query

00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:37,830
directly into my react

00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:47,190
[Music]

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:49,660
do you think yeah very exciting progress

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,369
we're looking for more people to help

00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,170
with this there's a lot of sort of

00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,589
visual improvements we can make to this

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,910
but starting to work you know it's

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:01,810
pretty exciting

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,849
alright so that's really you know in

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,880
that last track oh actually you forgot

00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:09,280
something sorry we've also made a lot of

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,160
performance improvements through JSON

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,609
API just in the last you know a few

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,390
months it's up to three times faster and

00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:21,430
actually for complex sites or a complex

00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,440
you know use cases it can be actually

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,540
much faster than two times three times

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,410
four times five times it just depends

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,570
and but what's maybe most interesting

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,430
about it is is that we found these

00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,980
performance improvements through

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:39,220
real-world use cases we're starting to

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:42,119
see very large you know sites or

00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,230
applications use Drupal 8 with JSON API

00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,820
and they're discovering all of these

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,220
opportunities for improvement which is

00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,200
great and it's been especially great to

00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,050
see how the community has rallied around

00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,280
these bug reports and collaborated on on

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:59,770
making JSON API faster so really good

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:04,210
progress there as well so as mentioned

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:06,280
that's the last track so overall I feel

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,500
like we've been making a lot of great

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,200
progress and again I haven't highlighted

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,790
all of the initiatives but you know

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,950
we're really delivering on the things

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,560
that we said we would deliver on now we

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,720
said I have to deliver on I feel like

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,369
development is accelerating it's

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,740
actually backed up by some research have

00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:25,599
done and posted on my site around how

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,490
many people contribute to Drupal and how

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,460
many organizations contribute to Drupal

00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:33,790
it's it's at an all-time high and you

00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,369
can see that in the serving in the

00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:39,310
roadmap that we're working on and so for

00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:41,560
me this is something to be really proud

00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,810
of and I think you should also be really

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,300
proud you know for yourself for

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,910
contributing to Drupal 8

00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:52,720
an 8.8 specifically this has been the

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:55,120
work so far of 641 individual

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,430
contributors pretty amazing number of

00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,150
people that helped build just 8.8 so big

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:07,510
hands up

00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:09,610
we're down yeah yeah and you know these

00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,960
organizations have been these

00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,510
individuals I should say have been

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,790
sponsored by two hundred and forty three

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:23,290
organizations as well so big applause

00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:26,110
for all the organizations - alright so

00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,760
however I did miss one of these items

00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm not sure if you caught it but I

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,140
didn't talk about the upgrade path do

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,580
Drupal 9 and so I want to cover that

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,560
real quick all right so that's the

00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,080
second part of my keynote its need rip

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,050
online readiness and just so you

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,210
remember I've said this before but we

00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:50,530
are getting really close to the release

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:53,380
of Drupal 9.0 we're literally only eight

00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,540
months out all right it's not that far

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,930
out and so I wanted to give you an

00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,210
update on that first of all we actually

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,570
created a Drupal 9 branch how many of

00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:07,120
you knew that all right some people knew

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:11,950
not all but you can check our Drupal 9

00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,300
alpha today can test it you know we're

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,760
updating it still we're removing

00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,560
deprecated codes I think we already

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,230
updated updated it to the latest

00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:25,330
symphony 4.4 release but it's kinda it's

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:29,380
getting real you know I hope you feel

00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:31,780
like it's getting real our commitment

00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,040
was to make the upgrades from Drupal 8

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:38,560
to Drupal 9 very easy the easiest one in

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,530
the last decades and so I wanted to show

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,430
you how you could go about upgrading

00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:48,730
your site from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9

00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:51,010
alright so I'm gonna use an example here

00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:55,270
is Johanna she lives in the Netherlands

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:58,060
she is a dog groomer and she has a

00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:00,010
website about dog grooming but she's

00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,490
also a very skilled Drupal the

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,440
developer and she has a fairly simple

00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,380
site she has some contributed modules on

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,640
the site one of those modules and I'll

00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,590
show that in a second is the EU cookie

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,350
compliance module to do these little

00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:19,300
pop-ups you know except the cookie which

00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:21,670
is obviously necessary for gdpr

00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,550
and then she has one custom module a

00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,740
module that she built herself for Drupal

00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:30,450
8 alright so let's see how she goes

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:33,250
about upgrading her site to Drupal 9

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,810
there's basically four steps that she

00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:38,650
has to do I'm going to walk you through

00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:41,620
all of these four steps real quick the

00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:45,400
first step is to install the upgrade

00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:49,960
status module you can see she's using

00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,850
composer yeah so she's just gonna you

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,190
know compose the require that module and

00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,630
what you'll see happen is composer will

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,060
figure out all of the dependencies for

00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,740
this module and download them you can

00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,510
see uses a little bit of design

00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,100
framework and some other stuff and

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,770
eventually all of these pieces are

00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,710
automatically installed all she has to

00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:11,830
do then is basically go to the Drupal

00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:14,890
admin UI and enable the module right so

00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:17,710
she did that the module is enabled

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:22,500
she's now ready to go so installing that

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:24,850
module is pretty easy with composer so

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,180
next she's actually gonna use this

00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:31,480
module to scan both the contribute

00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:33,250
module and her custom module and see if

00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,870
they're compatible with Drupal 9 and

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,780
then she's gonna figure out how to make

00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:44,820
them compatible so I'll show you that as

00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:47,350
well so here's the upgrade status module

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,600
as mentioned she's starting with just

00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,400
the contribute projects just gonna scan

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,590
them all and so when you scan your

00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,710
modules what happens in the background

00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:59,680
is basically some sort of code analysis

00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:02,080
looking for uses of deprecated code and

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,810
a module is ready to go to Drupal 9 if

00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,300
there is no deprecated code being used

00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,190
right it's pretty easy the tool is

00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,569
designed to help you highlight where you

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,940
may have incompatible code

00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:16,699
brocaded code in this case this cookie

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,529
compliance module is not ready however

00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:20,690
it said that there is an update

00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:23,479
available for the module and so she's

00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:26,599
gonna use composer to update the module

00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:29,150
to the latest version so she doesn't

00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,969
have to code or change any code she just

00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,279
has to upgrade to the latest version so

00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:38,059
you can see she's on 1.5 and she's going

00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:40,999
to 1.8 when she does that and shiri

00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:43,609
scans the module basically it's gonna

00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:46,459
come back green and say yep you're now

00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:50,630
ready to upgrade to Drupal 9 all of your

00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:53,809
contribute modules are already okay now

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:57,619
she still has one custom module it's a

00:45:53,809 --> 00:46:00,069
module that she uses to manage opening

00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:02,660
hours over you know dog grooming salon

00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:04,069
because it's a custom develop module

00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,319
there is obviously not an update

00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:08,390
available nobody in the community is

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,789
gonna update that for her so she needs

00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,400
to update that custom module herself so

00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:15,619
I'm gonna show you that as well so this

00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,709
time she's gonna select her custom

00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:20,420
projects in a great status module you

00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:24,170
can see two problems one is a warning

00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:26,449
one is a an error in this case she's

00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,699
using a function Drupal said message and

00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:30,949
the error is telling her that function

00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:33,680
doesn't exist anymore or will stop to

00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:37,549
exist in Drupal 9 the documentation on

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,799
drupal.org tells her how to fix it right

00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:42,049
so in this case the documentation tells

00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:44,900
her that that function was changed to a

00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:47,959
service so she quickly changes that in

00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,059
her coat and as you can see it's a

00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:55,190
simple change it's a one-line code

00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:57,999
change after she does that she saves her

00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:00,529
module and that should take care of that

00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:03,199
the second thing she has to do is deal

00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,269
with his warning in yellow so basically

00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,729
what this warning is is telling her is

00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:10,910
that she has to declare her module to be

00:47:07,729 --> 00:47:15,170
compatible not just with 8 but also with

00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:17,150
Drupal 9 which is something new to do so

00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,130
she has to edit the info file the dot

00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,619
info file of her project and basically

00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:24,499
at this it says this module will work

00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:25,540
with 8 and Drupal 9 at the same time the

00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:29,020
same code will be

00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,520
work with both versions yeah and so

00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:35,550
after she made that change

00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:39,340
shiri scans her custom module and boom

00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:44,190
opening times now works with Drupal 9 as

00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,190
well so that's pretty good right yeah

00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:53,200
for those I don't like to use the UI of

00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,970
the upgrade status module there's also

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,520
command line tools you can add those

00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,359
into your continuous development

00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,390
environments and all these things but

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:03,070
the point is the tools are ready today

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:05,020
the api's are ready the tools are ready

00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,390
you can start doing this stuff today so

00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,510
obviously the last step is she needs to

00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,040
update Drupal core to Drupal 9 so right

00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,580
now she is using eight point eight alpha

00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,220
one and she wants to switch to you know

00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,750
the development version of Drupal 9 and

00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,830
there are some instructions on

00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,640
drupal.org

00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:26,050
and she can basically copy paste she's

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,980
going to do that here and so basically

00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:33,010
what these instructions do is to sort of

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,380
update the composer JSON files update

00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:38,980
all of the dependencies there Drupal 9

00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:41,980
needs this is still a little bit complex

00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,869
but actually in talking to Ryan and drag

00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,880
they're actually working on making these

00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:48,040
commands easier so maybe by the end of

00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,500
the week could be a stretch goal I don't

00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,390
know some of this could be even easier

00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,200
now and obviously we're upgrading to an

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,250
alpha version of nine which is also a

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,260
little bit special bit like here you can

00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:01,270
see composer figuring out all of the new

00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,369
dependencies a triple nine has relative

00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,890
to eight and taking care of updating

00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:11,250
that and after it's done she's basically

00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:11,250
on nine so yeah

00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:21,380
it's great to you know start to you know

00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,840
see that come to life obviously Johanna

00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,550
is a simple sight right it's not super

00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,650
complex I'd but she was able to do all

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:31,790
of this in like 30 minutes or so it

00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:34,100
wasn't a big job I recognize a lot of

00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,930
sites have more modules more custom code

00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,550
as well and so it would take a little

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:40,670
bit more time but the principles the

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:43,480
concepts are the same and my key point

00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:48,770
is that this is a huge huge improvement

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:55,610
compared to Drupal 7 and I can go into

00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:57,230
that a little bit more yeah so we did

00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,090
some analysis of all of the contributed

00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:01,040
modules and it turns out if you look at

00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,960
just a top two hundreds which is what

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,000
you know most people use modules in the

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,700
top two hundred sixteen percent of those

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,420
modules are already ready today eight

00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:14,530
months before the Drupal 9 release which

00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,960
we've never had before frankly

00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:20,150
furthermore half of the modules are very

00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,980
close to ready and the way we measure

00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:25,670
that is they need fewer than ten lines

00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:29,120
of code that needs to be changed for

00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:30,680
them to be ready and then 34% of the

00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,130
modules they need more than ten lines of

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:36,140
code to be changed now if we look sort

00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,870
of if we open it up and we look inside

00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:41,840
of what these changes are we basically

00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:46,220
saw that a lot of these changes are easy

00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:47,900
in fact 29% of the changes you need to

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,870
make are like this Drupal set message

00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,560
example that I just showed in johannes

00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:58,210
video right so literally a third is just

00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:01,070
simple one-line changes specifically to

00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:04,280
Drupal set message and then the 71%

00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:07,490
that's left I bet you there's a lot more

00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,230
one-line changes to it so arguably we

00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,060
could almost automate some of these

00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,950
changes and get a lot of modules ready

00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,080
in record time so we'd be really

00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,060
interesting to see if we could automate

00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:21,320
some of this could be an interesting

00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,730
project to work on now some changes

00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,410
we'll need a little bit more work than a

00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,360
one-line change but still a lot of it

00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,960
will be easy and so the big difference

00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,110
but

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,060
seven and eight and eight to nine then

00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,770
drew from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 you

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,720
needed to rewrite your module so you

00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,460
couldn't start until Drupal 8 was

00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,500
released and then you had to do it serve

00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:42,020
in a Big Bang style all of a sudden your

00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:45,740
module was ready and it would work or it

00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:48,500
would work in Drupal 8 and going from

00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,870
eight to nine there's a lot of small

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,820
updates you need to make like the ones

00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,610
that I showed you you can start today

00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:58,550
eight months before we even release

00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,050
Drupal 9 and a lot of these updates can

00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,630
be incremental actually you make them

00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,400
today you can use those in eight so you

00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,040
can actually test these changes already

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,290
in production you know in a very

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,950
incremental way so big difference

00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:16,640
compared to the previous major release

00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:18,440
cycle and so you can help now as I

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,100
mentioned the tools are ready the api's

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,420
are stable and so please help us upgrade

00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,720
your modules

00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,910
help help updater contributed modules

00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,670
you can also help work on Drupal 9 we

00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,140
have to remove deprecated code from 9 as

00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:37,460
well and so that's an area where you can

00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:40,490
get involved as well so overall I would

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:43,400
say the Drupal 9 readiness is

00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,930
progressing really well you know I

00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,870
believe it's going to be easy to upgrade

00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:51,980
try to show that to you with the Johanna

00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:54,170
video and as I just mentioned you can

00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,180
start today but we obviously still have

00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,880
work to do as well but I feel like

00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:02,060
things are really on track for our

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,480
release target date of June 3rd of next

00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:08,530
year so big applause I think for all of

00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,530
the people to help with this

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,890
it's easy to show to his videos I make

00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,079
it all magically work I can tell you

00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,960
there's a lot of hard work a lot of

00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,690
diligence that goes into making it that

00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:31,190
easy so let's not take that for granted

00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:35,030
so the third piece of my keynote is to

00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:37,730
really talk a little bit more about sort

00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:41,000
of the Drupal 9 product strategy if you

00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:43,400
think about Drupal 9 development is

00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,180
gonna start soon what should we be

00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,770
working on it's a big question and so I

00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:52,069
wanted to share some initial thoughts

00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:56,030
with you with the goal to collaborate on

00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:57,950
you know finalizing them again if you

00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,319
look at the the mountain that we just

00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:02,869
climbed we're almost at the summit we're

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,119
not quite there yet but again as I

00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:06,410
mentioned we're actually working on all

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,390
these initiatives and making great

00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:11,839
progress it's pretty amazing to think

00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:15,020
we're gonna get these things done and so

00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:20,150
obviously behind this mountain will be

00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:23,089
another mountain and so this will be the

00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:25,910
drip of nine mountain and we need to you

00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:27,500
know just like we did with Drupal 8 we

00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:30,380
need to define these strategic tracks

00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,480
and for each of the strategic tracks we

00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,950
need to figure out what are some of the

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,680
initiatives that we want to put on there

00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:39,319
right and so that's an exercise that we

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:42,380
need to do and maybe we can change to a

00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:44,569
different you know doesn't have to be a

00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,849
mountain but we can come up with a

00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:50,030
different thing to keep it fresh but for

00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:52,520
now I'm gonna use a mountain analogy and

00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:54,319
so I want to talk a little bit about how

00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,560
we're gonna define these things all

00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:00,790
right so today what I'd like to do is

00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:04,250
actually propose strategic tracks and

00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:06,430
the goal would be to discuss them and

00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:10,130
refine them over the next six months

00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:11,780
right so this is my recommendation for

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,880
tracks and I'd love your feedback and we

00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:18,410
can tweak them but we should then refine

00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:21,290
them relatively soon and then secondly I

00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:24,500
want to launch a process a community

00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:26,170
process to help us identify let's say

00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,480
the first 10 in issue

00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:32,090
alright so in the past it's been a while

00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,040
so you may not remember especially if

00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:36,560
you're new but I've done these surveys

00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,240
and you know 3,000 people 4,000 people

00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,740
would answer these surveys and we would

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,380
gather all of this data and we would

00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,390
then use the data to get to initiatives

00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,870
right and so we'll be doing similar

00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,340
things so be assured there will be

00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:52,040
opportunities plenty of opportunities

00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,620
for discussion and input all of these

00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,870
things but I want to get us started so

00:55:54,620 --> 00:56:00,560
that we're ready by the time we're ready

00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:04,340
to start working on Drupal night ok all

00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:08,180
right so the first track that I'd like

00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:10,160
to propose has anything to do with this

00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:15,530
notion like we're all being asked to do

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:17,090
more of it less and this is something

00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:19,130
that I hear a lot when I meet with

00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,860
Drupal users you know they want it to be

00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:26,120
more efficient they want it to be less

00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:27,710
costly to build and run Drupal sites and

00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,370
so that is sort of captured by this

00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:34,160
notion this track in my mind is actually

00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:36,920
a continuation of a track that we had

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,070
and where we have some initiatives that

00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,990
aren't completely done right and so what

00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:44,450
I'm proposing is we basically bring back

00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:48,620
this track I change the name a little

00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:50,870
bit to reduce cost and effort and I'm

00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:52,490
sort of tentatively putting you know

00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:54,950
automated update and configuration

00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:56,810
management on that track because we're

00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,390
still working on them and we may not get

00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,500
them done by Drupal 9 right so if

00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,420
they're not done I think they're that

00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:06,140
important that we should keep working on

00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:10,340
them then the question is what other

00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:12,320
things can we do and again I'm not

00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:16,070
making recommendations here but I just

00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,930
want to you know give you a couple of

00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:20,000
examples of things that maybe we do do

00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:23,210
right like maybe we keep working on

00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,830
composer improvements maybe for a long

00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,930
time we've talked about reusable

00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:29,870
component libraries to help accelerate

00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:32,270
certain things some people have said you

00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,100
know what our developers love symphony

00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,960
so much it would be great if Drupal it's

00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,090
more symphony like verses sort of

00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,190
in-between that would help us save a lot

00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:42,559
of onboarding time

00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:45,109
other people have suggested maybe dress

00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,579
should be in court or a dress light kind

00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:49,579
of solution should be in court that

00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:52,009
would help as well so I don't know what

00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:54,319
all of the ideas are but start thinking

00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:57,619
about some ideas and then we'll find a

00:57:54,319 --> 00:58:00,559
way to aggregate them and you know vote

00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:02,719
on them or discuss them all right so

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,349
that's that in my mind is really

00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:11,529
important the second track in my opinion

00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:14,140
should be around ease-of-use you know

00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:16,369
just like every morning the Sun comes up

00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:20,900
we know that it's true and that will

00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:23,299
hopefully forever be true similarly we

00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,029
do know that ease of use will always

00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:31,489
matter and in fact it's starting to

00:58:26,029 --> 00:58:33,440
matter more and more and more right and

00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:36,619
Jeff Bezos has a great saying that I

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,779
really personally love you know in an

00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:41,059
interview he once was asked so how do

00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:43,640
you do strategy at Amazon how do you

00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:46,519
decide what to invest him and he said

00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,160
well most people try to bet on things

00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:50,930
that may happen in the future right and

00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,749
they try to sort of skate where the puck

00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:56,299
is going but at Amazon we actually love

00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:58,910
to invest in things that we know will

00:58:56,299 --> 00:59:01,940
never change it's kind of the opposite

00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:04,519
idea and so in a case of Amazon it's

00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,400
like you know they know that people on

00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:09,950
faster and faster shipping and cheaper

00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,690
and cheaper shipping costs and so

00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,460
they're investing billions of dollars

00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:16,249
trying to minimize those things because

00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,869
they'll be true forever and if they

00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:20,210
invest in it they know that that

00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:22,339
investment is gonna pay off and in my

00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:24,890
mind this is one of those things we know

00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:27,829
that in ten years we know that in 20

00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:30,109
years ease of use is going to matter and

00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:31,700
so it's worth investing in and so one of

00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:36,109
the things that we did actually our

00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:39,619
aqueon is we did a survey and we talked

00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:41,690
to a whole bunch of people both through

00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:44,719
a survey as well as true

00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:46,700
you know interviews and we and so these

00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,039
people are people that use common

00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:52,339
management systems some of them have

00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,570
used WordPress Adobe site or Drupal they

00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,510
have a variety of different

00:59:53,570 --> 01:00:00,050
levels of experience and we asked them

00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:02,690
simple questions like how would you rate

01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:05,590
that CMS that you have experience with

01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:08,570
would you say it's modern or outdated

01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:11,180
would you say it's a premium CMS or does

01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,610
it feel like it's a basic CMS is it

01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:16,730
empowering to you or is it constraining

01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:19,010
to you right to get the idea and so we

01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,950
gathered all of that data and what we

01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:25,280
found for drupal which hopefully won't

01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:28,490
shock anyone is that beginners don't

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,920
really love drupal right so you can see

01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,920
it's barely positive people beginners

01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,800
think drupal is very confusing look look

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,410
at how unclear drupal is right it's

01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,420
almost all the way to the bottom and as

01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:43,460
a result they wouldn't really recommend

01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:47,540
it to their friends or their family or

01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:53,380
their colleagues but I think as we also

01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:56,000
know is that as people get more and more

01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:58,220
experience with Drupal they start to

01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,230
love it more and more look at this

01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,600
intermediate users are really starting

01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:06,410
like wow this thing is pretty cool and

01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,510
then eventually experts we get really

01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:10,120
high marks right so and so this speaks

01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:12,830
to the learning curve that we have

01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:15,110
around you know Drupal being hard to use

01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:17,060
for beginners but then once you're an

01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,800
expert like probably many of you in the

01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,480
room you really loved it and you

01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,590
couldn't think about using anything else

01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,050
and so funny enough if we compare that

01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,820
with some of the other CMS's because

01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,060
again we didn't have just Drupal users

01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:36,260
in our in our research but we have

01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:38,360
WordPress people and so in a case of

01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,480
WordPress it looks very different it's

01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:43,250
almost going down right so beginners

01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,670
love it and as they become more and more

01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:48,610
experts they're like yeah no no it's not

01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:51,440
as school as it used to be as a beginner

01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:55,850
and you see similar patterns with other

01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:59,390
CMS's you know this is Adobe they're

01:01:55,850 --> 01:02:01,820
CMS's called experience manager so yeah

01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:04,460
not a lot of experts that love it but

01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,210
again beginners think it's pretty cool

01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,070
right

01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,360
pretty high but then it kind of goes

01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:13,670
as people get become more experts and

01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:16,730
same thing really with sitecore also a

01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:18,230
downward slope roughly the same idea and

01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,600
so it's really interesting if you look

01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,210
at Drupal versus everything else it's

01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:26,330
like we're going the opposite direction

01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:30,640
like everybody else is going down we're

01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,640
kind of going up yeah

01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:39,020
so you clap and that's great but this is

01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:41,300
good news and bad news I mean the good

01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,430
news is the you know experts love Drupal

01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:46,580
but the bad news is obviously we lose a

01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:48,350
lot of people early on like think about

01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,420
we get to a million unique visitors to

01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:54,320
Drupal the doric that's a crazy number

01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:56,630
every other CMS you know company or

01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,380
project we literally kill to get that

01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,870
kind of traffic

01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,180
but we're unable to convert those people

01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:04,910
into experts because it's such a hard

01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:07,910
experience and so the opportunity that

01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:10,610
we have in my opinion is to make Drupal

01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:13,160
really easy for beginners right we

01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:15,290
really need to work on moving that curve

01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:19,400
up on the beginner side and hopefully we

01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:21,740
can keep it you know horizontal we don't

01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:26,000
want to jeopardize the expert experience

01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:28,490
but we want to get the beginners up and

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,440
running faster and I think I really do

01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:33,290
believe that would be game-changing for

01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,980
us would help us recruit it would help

01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:40,280
us get more customers so I feel very

01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,810
passionate about that I've been thinking

01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:45,170
a little bit about what success would

01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:47,360
mean if we did this and in my mind

01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:49,640
success would mean as you can see on the

01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:52,130
screen like somebody can have a great

01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,950
idea like I want to build this and it

01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:59,030
can go from idea to discovering Drupal

01:03:54,950 --> 01:04:02,060
to deploying an implementation of that

01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:04,970
idea in record time today that's really

01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:07,400
hard I mean just think about like oh I

01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:10,190
have to build a theme for my site great

01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,230
that's a month of work right it's hard

01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:13,880
and in other you know WordPress as an

01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:16,370
example they have a marketplace of fees

01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,130
you can get a theme in probably an hour

01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,539
or a couple hours right so think about

01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:22,489
all of the differences between

01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:24,049
what we do and what some of the other

01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:30,259
projects do and that was just one

01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:34,489
example but so long story short what I

01:04:30,259 --> 01:04:35,959
propose is that the second track is all

01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:37,969
about prioritizing the beginner

01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:40,759
experience and it's an explicit choice

01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:43,279
if we choose the beginner experience it

01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:48,079
means that we need don't always focus on

01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:49,640
the expert experience right and again

01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:54,709
there's a lot of different things we can

01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:56,449
do like and again we will you know work

01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:59,329
on on all of these ideas together but

01:04:56,449 --> 01:05:01,099
things like guided tours we've also

01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:02,869
heard over and over again that the

01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:05,959
terminology in Drupal is really hard

01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:10,400
when you talk to beginners they think

01:05:05,959 --> 01:05:12,529
about content and components but we

01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,199
talked about notes and entities and

01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:17,749
blocks like simple things like that can

01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:21,949
make a big difference you know it's sort

01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:24,589
of the mental model I mentioned the

01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:26,630
marketplace of teens continuing to

01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:28,699
invest in the work that the layer

01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:32,150
builder team is doing more WYSIWYG more

01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:34,640
no code local kind of things making it

01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,229
easier to try Drupal we made a lot of

01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,349
great progress there but there's more we

01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:42,619
can do one interesting suggestion was a

01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:44,209
separation of journeys by role it's

01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:46,699
something that has come back over and

01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:49,130
over again in the last 10 to 15 years

01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:52,279
and the idea is that today if you're a

01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,679
content creator you're kind of launched

01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:57,049
into the same experience as a site

01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:58,579
builder but really you're doing very

01:05:57,049 --> 01:06:01,189
different things and so is there a

01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:03,709
better way to separate sort of the roles

01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:06,819
of these two personas when it makes

01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:09,349
sense to obviously install profiles

01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:11,959
could give quicker starting points as

01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:16,699
well and so I'm sure there's lots of

01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:20,150
other ideas we have actually already

01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:21,650
started working on one which I think

01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:24,799
will be really important for the

01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:26,839
beginners which is a new front-end theme

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,869
which is different from Clara because

01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:33,019
Clara is a back-end theme it's for the

01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:34,430
administrator the front-end theme is

01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:37,069
basically

01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:39,530
replacement for Bartek which Drupal

01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:42,650
ships with today and it's often the

01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:44,900
first experience that people get when

01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:46,099
you install Drupal and you don't choose

01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,430
umami

01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:53,809
today you get Bartok often right and it

01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:55,760
looks a little bit dated and so yeah

01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:58,010
when it was but like several months ago

01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,020
we had a meeting and people started

01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:03,650
brainstorming like how could we create a

01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:06,020
new front and theme for Drupal and the

01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:08,059
people at all about had really sort of

01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,660
rallied around that and they've been

01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:15,619
starting to work on a new theme

01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:19,210
it's called Olivera and I'm gonna give

01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:22,220
you a quick preview of the upcoming

01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:24,650
Oliveira theme and hopefully maybe we

01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,970
can ship it with Drupal 9 a Drupal 9

01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:29,089
would then ship it in your back-end

01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:31,250
theme and a new front and theme and that

01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:38,480
would be pretty amazing so here's a

01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:41,059
little video hi my name is Mike hi my

01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,920
name is Petra my name is Jared my name

01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:45,410
is Jenna my name is Matthew

01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,990
my name is Kat we're a team working on a

01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:50,660
libero what's Olivera our goal is for

01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:53,089
oliveira to be the new default theme for

01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,609
drupal 9 but wait why the sign under the

01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:57,680
fought thing for drupal arctic was a

01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:59,930
great theme for drupal but as time went

01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,130
by the web changed and bar text design

01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:04,099
stayed the same

01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:06,290
Bartek slowly began to feel dated it

01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:08,510
used outdated graphical elements such as

01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:10,790
gradients and drop shadows that made it

01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:12,619
feel heavy this can often lead to a

01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:14,890
negative perception of Drupal when

01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:17,390
people new to it do their first install

01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,279
we want to ensure that when people

01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,199
install Drupal they're immediately

01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,600
impressed not only by the power and

01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,170
versatility of it but also by the look

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,239
and feel

01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,160
what should a new theme look like to

01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,199
answer that question we worked with

01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:33,679
stakeholders to help establish a visual

01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:36,140
language we created an exercise in which

01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,540
each stakeholder can pinpoint on a scale

01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:41,060
of how they felt the new theme should

01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:43,250
look and feel once the exercise was

01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,929
completed we had a list of adjectives

01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,630
that we can use to help guide us through

01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:47,219
the design

01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:49,230
process from there we were able to

01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:51,179
establish more formal design principles

01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:53,100
that we could reflect in the overall

01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:56,880
design the principles we established

01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:59,730
were simple modern focused and flexible

01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,009
our current theme Bartok was named after

01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:05,359
Jean Bartik one of the original

01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:07,889
programmers for the ENIAC computer

01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,350
earlier this year the Drupal community

01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:12,779
mourns the passing of regional Oliveira

01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:13,259
and we have named this new theme in her

01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,359
honor

01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:18,239
Rachel touched many people in both the

01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,830
Drupal and accessibility communities she

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,600
worked at the National Federation of the

01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:24,630
blind and she was committed to making

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,100
technology accessible to all people we

01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,989
chose the name Oliveira and not just

01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,690
because we have made accessibility a top

01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:32,909
priority but also because we aspire to

01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:34,739
develop this new theme in our community

01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:37,020
in a manner that is consistent with the

01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:40,040
qualities that Rachel embodied including

01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:42,870
patience generosity and inclusivity

01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,580
so--that's Oliveira we hope that you're

01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,230
as excited about it as we are we

01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,060
couldn't be here in person although we

01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:49,859
will be a triple comm Minneapolis in May

01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,109
but we need your help sooner than that

01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:54,239
please comment on the issue below and

01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:55,800
let us know your thoughts we also need

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,020
help with actual development we're in

01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,960
the d9 - theme channel in Drupal slack

01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:03,170
and we hope to hear from you soon till

01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,170
then

01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,300
I think it looks fantastic and it would

01:10:15,889 --> 01:10:19,820
be great if you could ship it with

01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:22,850
Drupal 9 don't you think oh yeah

01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,080
we'd give it a fresh look out of the

01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,730
gate that would be awesome

01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:31,310
so big thank you to the wall about team

01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:34,790
for making that happen let's see alright

01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:37,610
so moving on to the next track which is

01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:40,369
actually track 3 which I believe should

01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:42,260
be about the open web and I recognize

01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:45,230
it's something that I'm personally very

01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:47,869
passionate about but the reason I'm so

01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:50,179
passionate about that is because as you

01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:53,239
may know as you probably know 1 out of

01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:55,699
40 websites in the world run on Drupal

01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:58,790
it's a lot of websites right and so I

01:10:55,699 --> 01:11:01,610
feel that with that comes a great

01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:04,130
responsibility and actually a power that

01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:07,580
we have that very few others have where

01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:09,230
we can drive you know part of the future

01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:14,030
of the web and we should think carefully

01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:16,130
about what we want to do with that you

01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:18,739
may know that today about 60% of the

01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:22,670
world is on the Internet and that in

01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:24,739
just a few years the entire world will

01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:27,139
be on the Internet will probably be

01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:29,690
driven by satellite internet people

01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:32,719
probably will have 100 gigabit

01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:34,310
connections because of that and they may

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,920
be launching Drupal sites from their

01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:38,960
phones you know I don't know exactly how

01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:42,110
it all will work but I do know that

01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,750
about 4 billion new people will come

01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:49,699
online and will come online very quickly

01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:53,719
and and as I mentioned I feel like we

01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:56,889
have a responsibility to you know keep

01:11:53,719 --> 01:12:01,070
the web open you know to keep it

01:11:56,889 --> 01:12:07,219
accessible to keep it secure to keep it

01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:09,170
private or at least privacy compliant to

01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:12,619
make sure everybody can benefit of the

01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:14,389
open web and you know that's a big

01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:16,400
responsibility so my recommendation

01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:20,330
would be that that would be the third

01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:23,869
track up the Drupal 9 mountain there's a

01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:25,699
lot of things we could do as well here a

01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:26,659
lot of different initiatives obviously

01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:29,150
things around GDP

01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:31,760
our own privacy making that better

01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:34,189
out-of-the-box again accessibility which

01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,840
hopefully you saw today has been a big

01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:40,280
theme for us but there's work that's

01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,320
never done making Drupal light or fast

01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,849
out of the box you know I think it's

01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,219
really important for those that do not

01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:48,110
have fast internet which hopefully

01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:52,550
everybody will have fast internet one

01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:55,099
day but that day isn't here tomorrow we

01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:57,530
could think about how we make our HTML

01:12:55,099 --> 01:13:00,260
even more semantic obviously we use

01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:02,570
html5 today but there's things like

01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:05,360
micro formats micro formats -

01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:09,619
specifically which add another layer of

01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:11,780
semantic metadata to HTML which could

01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:13,820
really help as well and then there's all

01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:15,679
sorts of new protocols like web mention

01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:18,409
I don't know if you know this but it's a

01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,090
w3c protocol which really helps you

01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:22,010
build sort of a distributed social web

01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:24,650
again I'm not suggesting that's

01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:26,539
necessarily what we do but there are

01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:28,820
certainly things that we can take from

01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:31,539
ideas and standards that relatively few

01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:34,039
people implement to making those things

01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:36,050
mainstream I mean if one out of 40

01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,419
websites uses these things you can

01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:41,949
really start driving adoption of some of

01:13:38,419 --> 01:13:46,820
these important technologies so that's

01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:48,380
essentially the recommendation to you

01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,510
know really think about what we can do

01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,369
to drive the open web it's something

01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,260
that we can uniquely do I think as

01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:58,010
Drupal as an open source project that

01:13:54,260 --> 01:14:01,400
very few other especially proprietary

01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:03,249
CMS's probably won't do this in order to

01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,530
have the scale to have a big impact so

01:14:03,249 --> 01:14:10,849
Trek 4 is about the explosion of content

01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:13,880
and data as I mentioned we'll have 4

01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:15,199
billion extra people so we can you know

01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,909
imagine these people will create a lot

01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:20,090
of content that needs to be managed that

01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:22,039
possibly even bigger is a massive growth

01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,630
in devices

01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:26,209
you know Internet of Things devices

01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:29,919
phones tablets all of these things so

01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:33,139
today it's estimated that there is about

01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:36,769
20 billion devices which is quite a lot

01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:39,709
but in the future the predictions are

01:14:36,769 --> 01:14:40,580
there will be 300 billion devices which

01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:43,280
is basically

01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:46,700
changing everything right we go from a

01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:49,100
world where there's a lot of content to

01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:51,050
the world orders of data and knowledge

01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,640
instant knowledge about all sorts of

01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:55,070
things by connecting all of these date

01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,590
devices and and so what it means for us

01:14:55,070 --> 01:15:00,140
is that we go from sort of a browser

01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:03,710
only world where content is manually

01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:06,910
entered in Drupal and pushed to HTML you

01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:09,620
know typical websites to a world where

01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:11,420
you know content needs to enter Drupal

01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:13,640
in you know ten different ways and leave

01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,470
Drupal in you know twelve different ways

01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,750
and and we need to do that at a

01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:21,650
different scale right so it's a world

01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:23,780
where we need to be really good at

01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:25,370
structured data really good at

01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:29,420
structured data and we need to manage

01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:32,660
more diverse data as well not just

01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,010
breast releases and blog posts and we

01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,380
should also think about how do we manage

01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:38,390
a lot more data because there will be a

01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:41,690
lot more data and then how do we make it

01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:43,850
really easy to integrate with all sorts

01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:47,420
of different platforms right we're its

01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:49,580
marketing technologies two devices - you

01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,320
know you name it and we're starting to

01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:55,820
see that already like here's an example

01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:58,280
of a digital kiosk in New York in the

01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:01,250
subway in New York and they actually

01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:05,450
power these kiosks with Drupal so they

01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:07,670
mounted devices on every metro in New

01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:09,560
York and and those in the subways or

01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:12,080
trains I should say they basically share

01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,120
that information with a Drupal site the

01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,760
Drupal site aggregates the information

01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,620
and then power these screens I basically

01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,930
say the next train will arrive in two

01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:23,390
minutes it's a great example of Drupal

01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:26,240
evolving from traditional web content

01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:28,670
management system to serve a bigger

01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,470
platform and I think I think that's

01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:32,150
pretty interesting so in my mind the way

01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:35,780
I think about that is we need to evolve

01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:37,700
from being a Content repository and

01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,280
we're a great content repository today

01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:42,110
to an even better content repository and

01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:44,420
think about how we can actually capture

01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:47,150
maybe different kinds of data - maybe

01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:49,460
more binary data and then how do we

01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:54,110
become really good at integrations

01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:55,909
between Drupal and other things so

01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:58,969
my recommendation would be that that

01:16:55,909 --> 01:17:02,119
would be the fourth track which is to be

01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:05,960
the best structured data engine there's

01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:07,639
lots of ideas here on how to you know

01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,190
what we could do there actually have two

01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:12,230
pages of ideas I think but obviously

01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,150
privacy will remain very important when

01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:16,909
you have all of that data but also think

01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:18,409
about a native dem like digital asset

01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:19,909
management like today people have a

01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:22,369
different digital asset management

01:17:19,909 --> 01:17:24,440
system and it's I don't know if it makes

01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:26,719
sense to manage users and permissions in

01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,520
a different tool and I don't know I feel

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:31,099
like there's an opportunity to to bring

01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,590
more data into Drupal data security

01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:35,809
maybe we need to expand beyond JSON API

01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:37,790
to support graphic UL and other things

01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:40,280
how do we make the content creation

01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:42,440
piece of Drupal even better how can we

01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,199
have SDKs and integrations with

01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:49,730
different frameworks react view all of

01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:53,599
these things right so again content

01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:55,070
ingestion if you think about like let's

01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:57,829
say every drupal site at 2 million

01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,389
pieces of data but tools we want to make

01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:00,800
it easier to manage all of that data

01:17:59,389 --> 01:18:03,110
would we use the tools that we have

01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,309
today or would we try and use and build

01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:09,079
different tools so lots of ideas here

01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:11,570
we'll figure them out assuming we like

01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:14,329
those tracks so these are the four

01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:16,400
tracks I think if we do implement those

01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:19,239
tracks we figure out the right things to

01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,619
do I think it would be great for Drupal

01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:23,300
you know Drupal will be cheaper and

01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:26,050
simpler to build with which is something

01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:29,059
that I hear a lot in talking to users

01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:31,940
Drupal will be loved by beginners which

01:18:29,059 --> 01:18:35,389
i think is really important and still

01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:37,969
loved by experts I think Drupal could

01:18:35,389 --> 01:18:40,190
promote an open independent web that

01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:43,040
serves all people all the people in the

01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:45,590
world and last but not least I think it

01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,139
means that by being a great structured

01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:50,270
data engine we'll be ready for a future

01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:52,340
where there could be a lot more data and

01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,639
a lot more integration so that's my

01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:58,369
current thinking I'd love your feedback

01:18:54,639 --> 01:18:59,929
you can share it with me you know in the

01:18:58,369 --> 01:19:01,550
next few days but again we'll have a

01:18:59,929 --> 01:19:03,889
structured process to collecting some

01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:07,200
feedback so the last piece I wanted to

01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:08,970
talk about is you know

01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:12,060
kind of the best product strategy in the

01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:13,440
world but you know speed and time

01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:17,460
matters right like we're not gonna be

01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:19,470
the only you know content management

01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:22,770
system that's trying to get to this

01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:25,260
world and so the way we can you know

01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:28,020
accelerate ourselves bring more people

01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,660
into the Drupal community will be really

01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:33,210
important as well because I think of the

01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,730
Drupal 9 mountain as maybe being bigger

01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:39,570
than the Drupal 8 mountain and so we

01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:41,550
might need more people to climb it and

01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,420
so the question is how do we climb

01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,910
faster

01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:47,100
how do we go further together right and

01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:49,890
so there's a lot of things that we can

01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,540
do obviously diversity is really

01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:55,470
important something that I talked about

01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:57,960
in my previous keynote that helps a lot

01:19:55,470 --> 01:20:00,060
in building great solutions we can make

01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,920
our processes better you know people

01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:04,230
sometimes complain it's hard to do

01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,430
things we can have better tooling which

01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:07,380
is something that the Drupal Association

01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:09,660
has been working on really hard to get

01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:13,530
better tooling we want to attract more

01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:15,450
volunteers but we also need more you

01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,730
know paid contributors sponsored

01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,020
contributors and today that's the thing

01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:22,950
that I want to highlight real quick

01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:26,280
before I wrap it up and so I literally

01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:28,470
spend my summer reading books and papers

01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,270
and either ended up in like a very long

01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:34,110
blog post that I wrote probably my

01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:36,180
longest blog post ever it was called

01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,860
balancing makers and takers in order to

01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:40,560
sustain open source you can go read

01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:43,110
about it but it's it's long but

01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:45,060
essentially the point is there's two

01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:48,630
things we should be focused on like how

01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:50,730
can we encourage what I call takers to

01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:54,690
become makers like how do we encourage

01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:58,370
those capable of giving back but aren't

01:20:54,690 --> 01:21:01,320
giving back to give back right so that's

01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:03,720
takers turning them into makers and then

01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,240
once we have makers like many of you in

01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,760
this room how do we promote them how do

01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:12,000
we encourage them to even contribute

01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:16,170
back even more and I won't go into the

01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,870
details here but um I did talk to a few

01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,870
people in our community on how to make

01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,850
that happen

01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:24,070
and so I wanted to play a couple of

01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:25,500
quick videos and talk to it a little bit

01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:28,540
and then tell you what we're gonna do

01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:31,780
about this all right so how do we turn

01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:37,990
takers into makers well I talked to

01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:42,100
Betty and my first contribution to

01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:44,260
Drupal was in 2014 so it took me seven

01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,970
years to start participating and

01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:48,490
understanding that there's a community

01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:50,500
behind Drupa before that I was just

01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:53,740
using the software because I like the

01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:55,900
technology and I liked Drupal and I was

01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:59,320
working with it but I didn't have a clue

01:21:55,900 --> 01:22:01,480
how to do it so I attended an event in

01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,040
Frankfort and then I actually realized

01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,810
that it was a community behind Drupal

01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,060
and that I could actually take part of

01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:09,040
it but that took also a long time until

01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:12,130
I figured out how I can participate as

01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,980
being a non coder in the community how

01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:16,780
can I help

01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:19,450
it's a very short snippet of we had a

01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:21,970
great 1 hour conversation and I'll post

01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:24,160
a longer version of this you know

01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:26,140
conversation interview on my blog but uh

01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:29,080
I thought this snippet was really

01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:29,620
telling right like you know think about

01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,750
badi

01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:34,870
and and you know 1x internet like

01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:36,520
they're our top contributors today but

01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:38,740
it took her like what 7 years or

01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,740
something to figure out that she could

01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:42,910
actually contribute it's kind of crazy

01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:45,730
and so it's something that we need to

01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:48,670
fix because if we can reduce that

01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:51,100
significantly we'll hopefully get a lot

01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:54,040
more people to contribute right and I

01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:58,000
think that's really important the second

01:22:54,040 --> 01:23:00,700
piece is about once we have a maker an

01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,470
organization that sponsors how do we

01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:06,840
promote them and I think it's really

01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:09,190
important that we promote them because

01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:13,420
if you think about it this way let's say

01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:15,600
there is $100,000 Drupal project right

01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:18,580
so let's say it taker wins the project

01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:21,850
the outcome of the project is a Drupal

01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:26,140
site that's great for Drupal promotes

01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:27,910
Drupal maybe that taker will also make a

01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:30,880
donation to the Drupal Association that

01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:32,560
goes towards Drupal con let's call it a

01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,809
thousand dollars that goes to Drupal con

01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,110
that's great but

01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:39,329
if we make sure that the maker wins a

01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:42,150
project we get all of these additional

01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:44,250
things we get the same Drupal site maybe

01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:46,170
even implement it better because they

01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:48,659
know how to build Drupal sites because

01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:50,670
they helped build Drupal we may still

01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:52,849
get the same contribution but maybe

01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:54,900
along the way they fixed some bugs

01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:56,869
implemented some new features that were

01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:59,579
required

01:23:56,869 --> 01:24:02,030
they started contributing to core maybe

01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:04,199
they even helped organize an event and

01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,880
baddest firm is a great example of that

01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:08,969
that's how they we tackle this project

01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:12,599
so as a community we have a huge

01:24:08,969 --> 01:24:15,659
advantage in driving potential users and

01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:18,059
customers of Drupal to makers because

01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:20,159
the return of that investment that I

01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:22,260
call it like a community return on

01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:24,809
investment because I haven't figured out

01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,150
a better words it's very better if the

01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:29,429
maker gets the project Drupal benefits

01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:31,500
Drupal accelerates in a way that it

01:24:29,429 --> 01:24:33,389
wouldn't when the project goes to a

01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,670
taker and that's why we as a community

01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:38,280
should really think about how do we

01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:40,260
promote makers and then incentivize me

01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,780
takers to become makers because they

01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,550
want to get the same benefits right and

01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:47,190
that's what my blog is all about and

01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:50,550
it's long but I encourage you to read it

01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:52,170
if you you know we've you know if you

01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,789
have thoughts about it or maybe disagree

01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:56,880
with it I'd love to have that

01:24:53,789 --> 01:25:00,420
conversation but the impact of doing

01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:04,349
these two things could be massive I mean

01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:05,849
imagine having 10 more Pfizer's you know

01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:08,880
they've driven so much in Drupal or

01:25:05,849 --> 01:25:13,429
imagine having 20 santaros the people

01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:16,409
behind ecommerce it's entirely possible

01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:18,840
to have that but we need to help those

01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:21,000
organizations be successful with Drupal

01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,429
it will lead to more contribution more

01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,710
diverse contribution more meaningful or

01:25:23,429 --> 01:25:27,719
deep contribution on the things that are

01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:29,369
really hard to fix and it will be

01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,800
healthier for a lot of the contributors

01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:34,559
as well because when you get paid to

01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:39,030
work on core or to work on Drupal in

01:25:34,559 --> 01:25:40,559
general not just core yeah it will be

01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:44,219
healthier and more sustainable for

01:25:40,559 --> 01:25:47,440
people right and so I asked another

01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:49,719
maker Tiffany Faris from

01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:52,570
Palantir again has been contributing for

01:25:49,719 --> 01:25:54,340
10 plus years to Drupal doing many kinds

01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:56,469
of contribution not just code

01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,510
contribution but event organizing

01:25:56,469 --> 01:26:01,030
serving on the boards you know all of

01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:03,760
these things that I asked or here's a

01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:06,880
top maker what would what would cause

01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,770
you to contribute a lot more like well

01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,820
we'd double your contribution right and

01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:11,820
so here's what she said

01:26:14,539 --> 01:26:21,300
when I think about what would encourage

01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:23,760
a company like Palantir to increase our

01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:26,010
contribution and I don't just mean a

01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:29,280
marginal increase I mean an order of

01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:33,449
magnitude increase I think we would be

01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:36,210
looking at creating a centralized system

01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:38,400
that that brought into alignment the

01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:42,630
interests of an organization or company

01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,730
like mine as well as the the community

01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:46,139
and the project you know what are those

01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:48,869
needs creating that alignment and then

01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:51,210
creating opportunities that truly

01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:53,610
advantaged those who made those

01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:56,480
significant contributions in a in a

01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:59,250
long-term capacity right I think that

01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,929
some of the hardest work some of the

01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:04,920
most important work some of the most

01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:08,719
urgent work that happens in Drupal has

01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:11,280
the least visibility and has the least

01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:15,030
external value placed on it in our

01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:19,619
current system so it you know it that

01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:22,559
over time deteriorates and and dilutes

01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:24,719
the impact of making you know really

01:27:22,559 --> 01:27:27,960
deep contributions to Drupal and

01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,239
incentivizes very superficial ones as

01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,000
well as indirect ones that are based

01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:35,579
around marketing or share but I think if

01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,739
we're looking at what it takes for

01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:40,829
Drupal to go from you know 40

01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:44,579
contributors to 400 full-time you know

01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:46,739
significant contributors it would really

01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:48,389
evolve around creating that competitive

01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:50,519
advantage for those firms that are

01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:51,929
really engaged in underwriting that

01:27:50,519 --> 01:27:55,829
success and underwriting that

01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:59,489
transformation of how we invest in the

01:27:55,829 --> 01:28:01,019
project in the product so that's

01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:02,489
definitely again we had a long

01:28:01,019 --> 01:28:04,590
conversation about this and I'll

01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:06,840
probably post a longer version of the

01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:08,250
interview on my blog as well because

01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,500
it's it's really interesting to see how

01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:12,539
organizations think about what would it

01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,030
take to really double triple quadruple

01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:17,489
their commitment and investment in

01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:19,650
Drupal and I think figuring that out is

01:28:17,489 --> 01:28:21,750
the way we go from 42 for hundreds

01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:26,159
full-time contributors which would be

01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:27,489
pretty interesting for Drupal so we're

01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,560
almost done

01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:30,910
but essentially the way I think about it

01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,500
is and I really spend a lot of time

01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:33,700
trying to simplify this but there's

01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:36,790
really two reasons

01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:40,690
why organizations do not contribute to

01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:41,910
Drupal well one they can't meaning

01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:44,410
they're not capable of contributing

01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:50,440
there's a variety of reasons why there

01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:52,630
may not be capable and - sorry is they

01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,800
want right so they're not motivated

01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:59,739
they're not incentivized to contribute

01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:02,860
and so what do we do about it well if

01:28:59,739 --> 01:29:04,989
they can contribute we can help them

01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:06,550
contribute we may not be able to help

01:29:04,989 --> 01:29:09,160
solve every problem we can definitely

01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:12,250
train them like we can train them on how

01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:13,540
to contribute that could overcome some

01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,940
of the reasons why they cannot

01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:17,830
contribute but if they're totally

01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,870
capable of contributing which I would

01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:22,570
argue is probably most of the people in

01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:25,000
this room most of the organizations in

01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:26,860
the Drupal world are probably capable of

01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,010
contributing but are may not be

01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:33,520
contributing so we need to you know

01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:36,040
motivate them for example through better

01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,739
incentives for you know for a

01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:40,180
contribution right so if you boil it

01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:42,250
down to these three things that I think

01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:45,239
it's pretty simple aligns very well with

01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:47,469
the makers and the takers concept and so

01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:49,030
we've had a lot of conversations about

01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:51,310
this with the Drupal Association as well

01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:53,620
and you can tell you that the Drupal

01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:55,330
Association is very serious about

01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:58,000
growing the Drupal community in the

01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:59,739
Drupal project and the contributors in a

01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,930
way that's healthy and sustainable and

01:29:59,739 --> 01:30:03,310
also rewarding for those that actually

01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:06,489
contribute and so I'd like to welcome

01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:09,450
back Heather on stage real quick to talk

01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:09,450
a little bit more about that

01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:18,350
so effectively recognizing all forms of

01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:21,110
contribution as an issue across all of

01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:23,390
open-source though Drupal has been a few

01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:25,820
steps ahead often if not always in

01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:27,920
trying to make this happen we're putting

01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:29,720
together a community recognition program

01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,239
and we've asked Mike Liam to spearhead

01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,620
that for us and we want to give you the

01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:40,489
opportunity to hear more about it in

01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:41,870
Mike's words we've seen healthy

01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:43,970
conversation lately about how

01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:46,220
contributions to Drupal are measured and

01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:48,200
recognized in our community and about

01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:51,560
how we can incentivize more people and

01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:52,850
companies to become contributors one of

01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,560
the encouraging things about the

01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:56,540
conversation is that we're talking about

01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,120
improving something our community is

01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:01,400
already doing what Drupal does today to

01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,770
recognize contributors is an example for

01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:07,010
other communities but we believe we can

01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:08,690
do even better for example it's clear

01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:10,880
that we need to make it easier for non

01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:13,220
code contributors to be credited for

01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,920
their work project managers committee

01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:17,720
members event organizers and sponsors

01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,360
all of these are more are important to

01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:22,010
the health of Drupal well we have some

01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,230
initial ideas on how to improve our

01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:27,290
contribution metrics but eager to hear

01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:29,330
from more voices in the community this

01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:31,430
is why we're establishing a committee to

01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:33,620
govern the contribution credit algorithm

01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:36,080
this isn't a one and done initiative

01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:37,910
fostering and recognizing the community

01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,880
contribution will be a long term

01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:42,620
iterative process if you'd like to help

01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,480
shape this world I hope you'll nominate

01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:47,530
yourself to join the committee simply

01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,530
share your feedback with us

01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:55,770
so we'll hope that you take a moment to

01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,900
go here and to help us figure out the

01:31:55,770 --> 01:32:00,000
community recognition program specifics

01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,200
but as stree said we're committed to

01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,030
making this happen and we hope that

01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:12,810
you'll join us along the way and I got

01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:14,400
the video to work thank you I think Mike

01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:16,380
said it said it well like we're already

01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,180
leading actually there's a lot of other

01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,920
projects that approach me and I'm sure

01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:22,710
others as well like wow you guys are so

01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:25,110
advanced relative to you know the credit

01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:26,580
system and how you are able to get so

01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:29,760
many people contributing through Drupal

01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:32,010
but I think I think it's really

01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:34,050
important for us to figure out the next

01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:36,090
steps as well and obviously very excited

01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:38,880
that the Drupal Association is going to

01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:41,270
work on this because and I think we

01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,340
should all really care about the

01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:46,890
longevity and the sustainability of

01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,450
Drupal an open source in general in my

01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,530
mind

01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:51,960
obviously the technical or product

01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:55,290
roadmap is great and we should focus on

01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:59,010
that as well but I'm figuring out this

01:32:55,290 --> 01:33:00,870
piece of our project you know not just

01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:03,330
for Drupal but again for open source in

01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:05,100
general in my mind is actually one of

01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:08,580
the most important things that we could

01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:12,120
be working on so very excited that we're

01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:18,390
going to work on that so to wrap up my

01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:21,060
keynotes yep you know lots of exciting

01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:23,190
things happening obviously Drupal 8.8

01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:24,660
I've shown you bits and pieces of it but

01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:27,450
it's jam-packed with new features its

01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:29,460
coming out soon it's a month away

01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:31,200
Drupal 9 is just around the corner

01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,570
please start thinking about Drupal 9

01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:36,210
help us update modules a lot of the

01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:38,760
things you can do there are things a lot

01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:41,460
of people can help with and I showed you

01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,560
some but let's make sure Drupal 9 is

01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:46,440
ready on time and that it's easy for

01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,360
organizations to migrate to let's

01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,850
collaborate on the product strategy on

01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,860
the new Drupal 9 mountain and what

01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:56,340
should we be working on so that we

01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:59,910
optimize the impact the Drupal 9 can

01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,790
have and then you know let's figure out

01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,250
how we can go

01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:06,370
faster and further as a community by

01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:08,440
bringing in more contributors as well as

01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:12,310
corporate sponsors so that's my keynote
