Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: Communication strategy to build digital experiences that connect.

Using Drupal, we can create amazing digital experiences, but you are only going to have the impact you want by giving just as much priority to your communication strategy as you do to you to choosing how to put it together.

As geeks and developers, it's really easy for us to succumb to the temptation of planning a website project based on the bells, the whistles, and the new shiny. "What Drupal modules do we need? Paragraphs? Domain access?" "Should we do a decoupled app? If decoupled, what front-end framework should we use?" ...

What we need to remember is that our technologies are a means to an endâ€”to communicate. And when we say "we need a website," what we actually need is to connect our vision, client, or organization to the people who need to know about it.

In this session, we will go into how to discover, define, and create a communication strategy, plus tools and workflows to put it into practice for yourself or your next client.

okay thank you very much so actually for

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,980
for reading wheels okay let's just get

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,680
started it's really really warm in here

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,570
this is Tracy Evans most people call me

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,880
Jam my name's actually Jeffrey McGuire

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,609
we founded a company called open

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,910
strategy partners a couple of years ago

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,679
and we helped tech I'm not getting my

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,360
speaker notes a do we need to figure

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,610
notes for this all right

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
okay well we'll fake it okay so

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,570
communication strategy to build digital

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,440
experiences that connect open strategy

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,559
partners we help technology

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,350
organizations we like to translate

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,539
between complexity things that you build

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,969
and deliver and and stories about

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,520
business value for example um a lot of

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,170
us have a great idea that we know adds a

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,239
lot of value to the world and our lives

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,329
but we have a hard time in explaining it

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,200
that's a sort of thing that we do and we

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,210
have a deep background an open source so

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,409
we can come in and have higher value

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,600
conversations with you about your

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,700
technologies then other agencies who can

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,880
also choose nice words and make pretty

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,950
pictures tracy has a really deep

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,950
background in business and he's a

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:28,200
hotshot MBA she's the smart one I'm the

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:32,310
one I'm the pretty one obviously we came

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,829
together I came off of mmm starting as

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,110
the 18th employee at Acquia and after

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,700
nine years there I had a lot of ideas

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,579
about how to talk with developers how to

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,270
build communication and so on and I did

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,439
several hundred interviews and other

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,409
publications along the way so

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,240
communication and actual education and

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,920
structure and strategy and that turned

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,680
into open strategy partners where now

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,920
there's about eight of us on most days

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,630
and then we're having a good time with

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,299
it so far we've got a bunch of clients

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,360
and projects so we're going to talk

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,469
about how not to connect we're gonna

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,849
talk about a thing that we call

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,129
authentic communication we're going to

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,050
talk about our strategic communication

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,070
foundation and how you can use that as a

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,920
tool set

00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,500
some specific things within that and

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,740
then how that turns into a better way to

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,110
connect because we only have a couple

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,840
more minutes we're gonna skip all the

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,280
details we're gonna talk fast anybody

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
who has any questions we're super happy

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,000
to hang out in the hallway afterwards we

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,380
are going to be at the special words

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,790
tonight we're going to be at the karaoke

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,740
party tomorrow and we're gonna be here

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,440
all week anyway so just just find us

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,620
okay and we'd love to talk it's open

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,900
strategy partners calm obviously so how

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,470
not to connect who in this room is a

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,840
developer right so a great communication

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,490
strategy does not start by choosing your

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,050
version of Drupal and how you're gonna

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,460
set up the configuration and is it going

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,070
to be headless and what modules you're

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,990
going to use right feels obvious but

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,600
like that's what we actually care about

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,920
all right you know now I get to use this

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,440
thing or I get to build a new thing

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,880
right mmm but the web's a communication

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,100
medium and we really have to think about

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,490
some other things it also doesn't start

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:18,000
like this right which is the stuff that

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,700
some other of us really really love so

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,450
open strategy partners is definitely not

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:29,880
about marketing bingo um so if

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,940
it's not the technical stuff and it's

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,980
not this marketing stuff what is it when

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,250
you're thinking about building a

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:42,080
communication strategy it is it it is um

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:44,520
we think that you need to communicate

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,160
the right stories the right information

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,200
about what you do what you build to the

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,400
people who need to know it and connect

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,620
with them so that you can grow so

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
growing could mean a lot of different

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,620
things are you an open-source project

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,380
you need more people to adopt and use

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,270
your your product are you a company

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,520
building open source solutions maybe you

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,400
have to explain to potential clients why

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,700
a free and open solution allows you to

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,050
do better work for them maybe your open

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,280
source Association and so on whatever

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,510
growth means for you do you need a

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,130
partner network do you need more revenue

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,370
do you need employees there are

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,530
different stories that you're gonna tell

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,330
about what you do to get there and

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,220
one of the things that I brought to the

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,140
company that we've developed a lot since

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,140
then is what we call the authentic

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,420
communication framework and we talk

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,910
about communicating with empathy clarity

00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,080
and Trust and when you use these and do

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:44,940
these they build on each other and it

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,810
becomes a very virtuous circle so

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,540
talking with empathy

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,550
it comes all comes up a lot in society

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,080
now a lot in sort of new models of

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,860
corporate government governance and

00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,520
management and so on but essentially

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,050
there are when went on a practical level

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,440
when we're talking about building

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,590
communication about what you do okay how

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,640
many of you were developers in the room

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,060
how many of you have a business

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,450
background traceable you end up yeah

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,140
right

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,390
so you people and you especially Tracy

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,450
right you get really excited about

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:26,669
market analysis and target audiences and

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:29,169
and and segmentation like that word

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,060
segmentation and clustering even even

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,970
worse right but that's really amazing

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,010
exciting stuff now developers developers

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:43,860
how do you feel about this stuff is it a

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:47,110
solid right but as open-source

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,150
practitioners we most of us we really

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,890
care about what we do right a lot of us

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,229
come from really idealistic backgrounds

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,850
and we're not just using technology for

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,900
technology's sake right we want to make

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,080
the world a better place we have a

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,150
vision that we want to realize so who in

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,919
the room cares about solving a problem

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,830
that other people need soft good right

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,380
and people should know about that you're

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,940
solving that problem right and you

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,350
should probably know who else is solving

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,780
that and how you're solving it better

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:21,250
right so communicating with empathy

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,580
these are exactly the same things for

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,470
the business um personas and for the

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,570
open source developer personas right so

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,910
when we on a practical level this this

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,410
empathy thing lets us choose different

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,720
words and different paradigms for

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,210
getting across the same story and for

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,340
connecting right with whomever you need

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,100
to

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,320
connect with when we talk about clarity

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,820
we talk about making things that are

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,520
clear to read but we also talked about

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,160
using logic we also talked about saying

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,740
what we can't do right now cuz honesty

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,300
what is honesty do in in our world

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,139
honestly also really really helps build

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,030
trust so we make we're very clear about

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,370
who we are and what we do and what we

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,800
can't do and we produce it as well as we

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,370
can as communications professionals um

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,960
and then we talk about trust and we feel

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,280
that once you start talking about trust

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,970
this thing starts to build on itself

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,260
right so try not to use insider language

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,000
that other people aren't gonna

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,580
understand try and be as simple as

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,870
possible be technically accurate at all

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,530
times

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:27,200
right for God's sake because that's like

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,610
the developers generally we feel we're

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,710
allergic to marketing and it's mostly

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,950
because we read we read about vaporware

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,389
in inaccurate but then you know nonsense

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,490
words right that turns us off

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,190
immediately and if we are trying to help

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,190
our clients get something into your mind

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,860
we can't risk that we've developed a

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,389
thing we called a trust signal audit and

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,520
this is around if you have an open

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,630
source project this is how this is

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,700
focused having these things we feel now

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,590
picture trying to choose a module for

00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,419
your project in the drupal in the

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,650
repository right you're gonna see how

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,300
many times it's been installed how

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,340
active the issue queue is and so on

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,510
those are trust signals so for a project

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,690
we want to make sure that we have a

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,950
clear code of conduct we want to make

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,020
sure that there's a contribution

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,160
guideline we might look at how many

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,139
times it's downloaded what's the license

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,240
who thinks I'm like it pointless to

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,729
measure that you need a clearly declared

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,969
license because if we all know

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:27,879
right I consulted on a project that was

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:30,069
five years old at the time and 300

00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,919
million euro investment from the

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,810
European Union that had not declared its

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,139
licence so all of the corporate

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,639
contributors could take their code back

00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,719
it wasn't really open source and it was

00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,810
a huge mistake right

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,730
so trust signals um we think about these

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,560
a lot and this builds an ecosystem

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,870
around your projects around your

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,220
products and so on that lets people

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,630
trust what you're talking about

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,370
in the rest of your communications and

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,949
of course these are all communication

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,440
exercises as well at a strategic

00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:01,750
communications level Tracy will now tell

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,889
you about our framework so I guess

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,360
everybody here in this room can

00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,810
appreciate the value of starting with a

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,269
framework right and we do the same with

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,000
communication and a lot of these topics

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:16,860
should look familiar to you in in

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,959
planning your communication one of the

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,670
and.and this framework is an important

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,570
base to start from

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:29,410
so aligning all of your ideas and plans

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:31,870
around mostly these topics are going to

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,480
give you a solid foundation to better

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,690
connect with your audience most of these

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,930
should look familiar I think a piece

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,220
that's unique to to OSP is the value map

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,560
and I'm just gonna tell you a little bit

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:50,949
about essentially the the value map is

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,810
an inventory or a or a collection of all

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:56,050
of the value statements all of the

00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:00,220
features of a product this value map

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,720
helps us be more accurate because we do

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,290
some background work we get into the

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,079
details we sort out what exactly you

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,790
know what your product does what it is

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,589
what it does and the value that it

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,769
delivers and the way that we do that is

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,950
by having this collection of value

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:21,860
statements

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:24,320
and the value statement result this

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,530
might be so any given value statement

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,660
for the data geeks of that any given

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,380
value statement is is actually a triplet

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,210
of a feature and what we call an

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,980
activity we could also call it a method

00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,060
or a delivery mode or a lot of other

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,670
things but you have a feature and an

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,570
activity and a benefit right so any

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,450
given feature can feed up into one to

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:51,170
end business benefits right delivered by

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,330
an activity so once we so there's

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,720
benefits in the center and activities

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,060
around this pie and and that benefit and

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,130
that activity are connected with any

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,040
with any number of features in the

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,470
middle there so then every one of those

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,860
triplets we produce a value statement

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,420
which is a very compact doll not well

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,040
written statement about what it is what

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,570
it does and what value it delivers and

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,940
as soon as we have that you can see that

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,850
we can turn that into a database do

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,750
MapReduce functions on it to produce

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,580
different things and we can start to add

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,530
layers about like whom we need to talk

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,640
with and if it's for a different persona

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,480
then we talked about it in a different

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:33,410
way and so on right and then a CMS has

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,480
six or 700 of these middle complex

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,990
design system tool that we're working

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,380
with called knapsack has about 150 yeah

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:46,070
yeah so this is uh so we take these sort

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:48,020
of atomic level features put them into

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,770
value statements and then we organize

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:54,740
them across different feature areas is

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,080
what we call them and so this this image

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,150
here might represent you know eight

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,780
different feature areas of a given

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:06,710
product and I think Gemma has already

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,680
explained this idea of a value statement

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,270
what that is and that if we take

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,480
essentially the atomic level which is

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,940
usually what the technical side cares

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,870
about we connect it to the area or the

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,660
activity that where that brings its

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,160
value and then the benefit is the

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,709
positive results and that's usually

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,759
where what the business people that that

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,980
is usually the layer that helps

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,990
translate the value of the technical

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,029
feature into what that means for the

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,269
business person right so then there's a

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,529
huge there's a huge like there's a huge

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,910
picture here and we'll just paint you a

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:44,620
sketch and then you at the geek level we

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,879
care about the individual features and

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,949
how things are put together and the

00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,470
smallest atomic units usually but we

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:52,269
have trouble connecting what we're doing

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,680
to this story of the value that's being

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,240
delivered and what the business person

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,399
might want to spend money on right so

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,750
with this mapped out we can look at the

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,050
features we're working on and start to

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,660
understand what is what value were

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,069
delivering and at the same time we can

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,110
create communication you can create

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,939
communication for the business persona

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,069
saying you can get this in this from our

00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,259
product and be like yeah sure you can

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:16,180
how do you do that and we could say well

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,769
boom boom boom and it's all documented

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,829
and it means your sales team is not

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,660
spinning hot air right it means that you

00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:26,410
have something that's backed up by what

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,300
what your product is actually built the

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,100
next step that we that we take the value

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,759
statements and the and the value map is

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,470
that we roll these up into feature area

00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,509
positioning statements and then product

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,040
level positioning statements so we take

00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,750
these clusters and we collect them all

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,410
into groups and we roll that up into a

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,750
signals a single a single statement

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,269
about the product itself and what this

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,470
helps with is you know when you're when

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,630
you're talking about the high level

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,259
value of a product it's no longer based

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,810
on buzzwords or or or fluff it's

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:01,209
actually based on this concrete detailed

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,550
technical analysis of your product right

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,139
and so you're inside out communication

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,250
and you're outside in and communication

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:14,230
match and they both make sense and then

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:17,709
what we do is roll these clusters up in

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,410
and you know if you several products

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:22,420
across your your product line for

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,449
example the deduct team and the deed of

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,959
local might be might be one product and

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:31,360
deed of live is another product but then

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,759
there's platform level features that you

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,819
get out of using their entire tool chain

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,160
for example and you take those and roll

00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:41,390
them up into the bread level positioning

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,329
statement

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:49,310
so with a massive six minutes to go we

00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:51,019
talked about how not to start connecting

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,180
we talked a little bit about our tooling

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,220
and and and one specific piece of the

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,320
tool a couple specific pieces of our

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,600
tooling the value mapping and the trust

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,279
signal audit so now let's just talk

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:07,959
really really briefly about how to

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:11,089
connect because the value map gives us

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,100
statements of of functionality

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,680
statements of benefits to deliver that

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,410
we can backup that are factual right it

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,760
gives us a huge repository to then once

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,220
we've done all the other marketing work

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,990
of figure out whom we're talking to what

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,589
they care about how they're going to

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,779
interact with with with us right we

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,940
figured out how trustworthy the the

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,260
project looks we can we can look at

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,730
certain narratives which are like

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,050
evergreen stories that you want to tell

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,120
over and over again about what

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,029
reliability about to return and that's

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,519
whatever it is for you and then we do

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,920
the work of making plans and and

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,220
creating channels creating assets and

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,760
end up and getting them out into the

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,300
world and um but this lets us do it in a

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,240
way that connects with people

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,940
so using empathy clarity and trust plus

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,190
doing a lot of hard homework to really

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,630
really get the facts out lets us put

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,529
this all together to help people

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:12,190
communicate connect and grow any

00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,190
questions

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:21,900
and we have time for questions yes your

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,660
issue tracker yeah is it that is it a is

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,010
it a product is it uh well it's a trust

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,350
acknowledge that I don't if you're

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:33,660
maintaining your yeah oh that's

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,270
definitely a trust signal right because

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,550
if I see how how often you're working on

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,470
what you're doing and that you're taking

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,480
care of people's issues if an issue

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,190
represents the future because it starts

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,500
out as a request and you write a test to

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,990
it and you specify the feature where

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,900
does that fit into the component map

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:55,230
that you had like do you do you actually

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:59,300
use issues generated and feature

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:03,630
requests with me in an issue tracker no

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,930
we do both in preparing this stuff and

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,610
in a lot of the content we do we do

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,020
interview and workshop formats so we

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,660
like will usually get a

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,070
multidisciplinary team together like a

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,670
business person a couple technical

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,510
people a marketing person and workshop

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,980
what do you think is great about your

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,110
product works well it's really well what

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,150
are the product on paper and yeah on

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,470
paper on we have canvas tools for online

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,880
workshops yeah there's a lot of

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,350
interviewing the people who are actually

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,510
building it right but I think to expand

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,190
on that the idea is that so some of

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,100
these methods are the way that we start

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,350
to get a baseline and then with every

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,810
with every product development with

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,710
every release you need to go back and

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,780
update the value map so that it stays so

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,870
that it's maintained along with all of

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,460
your other documentation treated in the

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,820
same cycle as the rest of your document

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,250
right so so we we tell clients that this

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,360
should be this is documentation and that

00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,800
it you know it should be in your

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
definition of done just like updating

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,070
every other writing good release notes

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,650
and so on and then it becomes a tool

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,330
that when you're planning a campaign

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,550
you're planning a specific number of

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,130
assets you can go in to the value map

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,680
filter it for a specific personas

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,900
specific product area specific problem

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,850
space and collect all of those features

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,680
out of there and make sure that that's

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,460
built into your communication plan just

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,460
for example

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,750
perhaps very practical examples of how

00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:32,330
to file you have record comment goes in

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,830
their video granula and how specifically

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,830
you

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,830
each of those decks would be as specific

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:45,230
as possible it doesn't need to be as

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:47,269
granular as is practical and the reason

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,350
for that is you know you might end up

00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,820
with a value map of a few hundred

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,070
features that you'll never put in front

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,769
of a client you know strip straight up

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,649
here's you know overload them with with

00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,230
information but for anybody that's

00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:02,539
creating marketing materials for your

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,029
company whether that's an agency or your

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:08,119
internal team you need a single source

00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:10,129
of truth and you need and you need to

00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,529
have agreed upon language the

00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:16,730
inspiration for the value map was

00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:18,139
actually starting to work with a CMS

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,019
project and trying to understand the

00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:24,049
space and seeing that Drupal was talking

00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,429
differently than the typo3 was than

00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:28,039
talking and they were talking

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,350
differently than Adobe was and it was

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:34,129
really difficult to understand and so

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,960
and and seeing that and even within an

00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:39,350
existing organization I've had a lot of

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,169
experience where the product team versus

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,639
the developers versus the marketing team

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:47,389
we're all talking about the product in

00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:50,720
very different ways and that makes it

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:54,259
really challenging to have a coherent

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,039
clear message going out so at that point

00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,080
when you've done one or more multi

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,489
department workshops the stakeholders

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,980
eventually are all on the same page

00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:05,600
about at every single level what your

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,470
product is what it does and what value

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,629
it delivers and all of a sudden

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,070
everybody's pulling actually pulling in

00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,320
the same direction and aware of what's

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,299
going on and it can help you make a

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,190
roadmap because if you then start to

00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:18,080
make a value map of your competition

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,999
then you can see what features you have

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,679
and what they have and are you a market

00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,539
leader defining a niche or you following

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,679
someone else what language choices have

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,629
they made how do you build your

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,489
communications do you prioritize one

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:30,409
feature over another it becomes the data

00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,940
set becomes really really powerful and

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,559
also to help you build your your

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,629
positioning right because in the value

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,169
map you can clearly indicate what our

00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:39,700
what our table stakes versus what

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:41,559
differentiate you from your competition

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,690
and where you should focus some of your

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,629
messaging around being a lot clearer yep

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,049
so we're out of time thank you so much

00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:51,450
for coming on this race with us and see

00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:58,029
you around this week

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:58,029
