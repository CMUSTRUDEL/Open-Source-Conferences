Title: 4 Keys to a Successful Globalization Strategy and CMS Platform Architecture
Presenter: Tina Williams
Description: How do you deploy and manage web sites in 137 countries and over 30 languages around the globe? IBM is using Drupal 8 translation and inheritance capabilities to help transform Enterprise Globalization Strategy, Processes and Roles.  The result? The new global marketing web footprint is now delivering higher client engagement in global markets. 

This session includes a review of the key elements of this successful transformation: Strategy, Process, Roles and the supporting CMS platform functions.  The session will cover the business requirements and the technical solution. IBM uses Drupal 8 core translation modules and the TMGMT contrib module, extending the functionality to improve translation quality. Inheritance functions support efficient management for regions and reduce the need for localized content. . 

What you will learn and experience:
- The importance of preparing your Drupal environment to be “global ready”
- Special architectural considerations for supporting globalization
- How to build language inheritance models to limit localization efforts 
- Demo: Translation workflow optimized for speed, quality and machine learning 

No prior experience is required but a basic understanding of globalization requirements will be helpful.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
so I think we're ready to start so

00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:08,340
thanks for everyone for being here this

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,740
is my first Drupal con I'm Tina Williams

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm from IBM and I'm going to share a

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,590
little bit about our story with

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,170
globalization using Drupal my colleague

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,180
and Maurice Sheppard is not able to be

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,490
with us but I have a demo partway

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,970
through the presentation that you'll

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,740
hear from her and also the end of the

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,869
presentation she's our engineering lead

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,030
will be more of the slides that she

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,149
would have covered but I'll just cover

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,930
those today we have a lot of material

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:41,640
we've broken every rule of conference by

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,739
having way too much information on each

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,640
of the slides but hopefully it'll be a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,610
good reference for any of you that are

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:58,170
pursuing globalization with Drupal so

00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:01,320
let me get started so we're going to

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,270
cover today the four keys of success and

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,720
for us that was really about first

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,740
developing a Geo focused strategy with

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,580
IBM we have 137 locations on our website

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,590
around the world then we also wanted to

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,770
transform our processes and that was to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,049
become more efficient finally we wanted

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,210
to redefine our roles so we could have

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,119
more ownership in our geo sites our

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,890
Jia's are responsible for their revenue

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,079
targets so we wanted to give them full

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,659
control of their digital presence and

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,070
then finally we wanted to have a CMS

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:41,310
platform that supported our

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:44,220
globalization strategy so what were our

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,640
problems we had from a user experience

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,020
standpoint we had inconsistent languages

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,479
being deployed across all of our

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,799
business units iBM has many different

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,630
business units and they were all

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,939
operating independently and making

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,979
choices there themselves about which

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,890
languages to deploy and where to deploy

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,740
so we also had a Content issue in our

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,079
Gio's where some geographies would have

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,879
all of our portfolio some other

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,920
geographies some other countries and

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,590
regions would only have portions of our

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,360
IBM portfolio so we needed more cancer

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,700
see there we also didn't have a good

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,190
model for delivery of content into the

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,860
geography so we could have our local

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,930
market teams running campaigns and then

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,610
all of a sudden they'd get a new page

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,140
into their market or their page that

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,200
they were using for their campaign would

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,660
be overwritten by our worldwide teams so

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,510
we wanted to address that issue and give

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,660
them more power and to the content that

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,690
was coming into the market we also were

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,670
having extreme delays in our

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,239
globalization effort it could take up to

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,640
12 weeks for us to translate pages and

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,220
get them deployed into our local markets

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,860
so we knew we needed to have some better

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,810
way to do this much faster and address

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,180
the issues and one of the primary

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,720
problems we were having was we were

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,510
using in market marketing resources to

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,340
validate our content and that was where

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,430
we were really running into time because

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,560
Joe the marketing guy didn't really have

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,840
time to validate the translation or if

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,819
he did do it he would completely rewrite

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,790
it and so we didn't want to have that

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,250
rewriting of our messaging in the local

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,530
markets and we just really didn't want

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,690
to be using a volunteer resource for

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,260
that activity so we made a change there

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,579
and then finally the the platform at the

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:42,239
time that we started we had I'd say five

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,910
different legacy systems with marketing

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,430
page content and we wanted to move to a

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:51,180
single consistent CMS for all of our

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,419
pages and we first moved to all of our

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,120
worldwide pages over and that was in

00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:59,579
2017 and 2018 and there's a talk from

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,579
Seattle from the team that did that

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,799
migration I'm gonna focus on now that we

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,049
have the content are worldwide content

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,910
in Drupal how did we globalize that

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:15,870
content so this is just another picture

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,590
to show you just how complex our sites

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,630
were this is actually from 2016 where we

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,419
we were looking across all the different

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,099
sites and for our homepage we had a

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,240
hundred and thirty seven hundred and

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,889
forty countries in

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:35,160
37 different languages we had for our

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,110
some of our product catalog and our

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,400
software catalogs weren't even synched

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,259
up they were going to different

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,050
languages in different countries our

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,949
legacy saw product lines like our

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:50,069
mainframes we're going out to a much

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,349
larger number of languages and locales

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,560
but then our new product lines like our

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,599
cloud IBM cloud were going to fewer

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,419
markets and fewer languages really

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:02,419
targeted on the new market opportunity

00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:10,169
so the result was really a disjointed

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,759
user experience so in use news Beca Stan

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:17,099
we had deployed on ibm.com homepage in

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:23,599
2015 and half of the content on that

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:26,580
page was in Russian and you use back and

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,319
other languages and then the content

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,139
itself was so out of date it was

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,669
promoting a conference in 2015 in Las

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,590
Vegas

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,020
so we don't even run that conference

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,000
anymore so we had an issue with even

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,000
keeping content maintained in these

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,830
markets and then you'd see you know Tom

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,469
and Croatian might be able to find the

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:51,000
home page in our our legacy systems

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:53,849
sites someone in Germany almost all of

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,069
our sites were being kept up to date for

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,449
Germany and for the US market everybody

00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,699
there was happy and could find

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,590
everything but then as you started to go

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,199
to some of our more minor markets like

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,180
Aruba we had our whole product catalog

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,430
did we really need it there so we really

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,259
were looking at where do we need content

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,419
who are the who are is our audience in

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:22,650
these markets and how can we best serve

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:25,349
them so we developed a strategy where we

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,039
wanted to look at what consistent

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:30,750
languages could be set up so we have a

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,630
market development insights research

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,320
team within IBM and we asked them to go

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,779
look at all of the different markets

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,050
understand the proficiency in the

00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,930
different languages

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:48,610
for our specific audience so for someone

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,830
that's buying IT related services and

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,650
then also looking at where do we have

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,659
marketing resources and what is their

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,509
language proficiency and also are our

00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:00,940
sales resources so we wanted to align

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,370
all of this to make sure that we came up

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,590
with a set of standard languages that

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,319
were sufficient for our markets but also

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,440
and also aligned to the resources that

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,680
we had so we didn't just decide this we

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,470
got the research from our team then we

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,509
went out to each of the geography leads

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,190
and we talked to them about the

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,720
languages because we of course we're

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,000
going to take away some languages that

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,030
we were supporting we got their

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,919
agreement and then we turned around and

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,620
went to each of the business units in

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,810
IBM and talked to them about making this

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,620
change as well so we really took the

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,810
time to socialize the research get the

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,699
buy-in and then we said okay this is

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,819
going to be the standards so we didn't

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:47,560
dictate it we work together with all of

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,919
the organizations to make sure everyone

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,069
was in agreement the next thing we did

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,870
was we decided on the local locales that

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,300
we wanted to focus on so the countries

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,569
and regions that were important and

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,520
again we went out to the geographies and

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:06,219
talk to them about let's look at your

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,409
traffic let's look at the revenue coming

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,969
in where do you see your emerging

00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:12,360
markets where do you see your declining

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,710
markets where do we really need to have

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,909
content and where do we just really need

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:21,639
a brand presence the next thing we did

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:24,419
after we knew the languages the

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,289
countries we wanted to support we set up

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:31,449
the staffing model to support that

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,849
followed by a whole new set of processes

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,940
and process improvement to make

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,909
globalization run much quicker and at

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,829
the end we gave the ownership to the

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,250
pages going into the market to the new

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:47,350
resources that we put in place and then

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,440
finally and there's this is

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,079
intentionally the last thing we worked

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,800
with our engineering team to customize

00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:58,759
our Drupal implementation

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,660
to support all of our needs so these are

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,420
the standard languages that we agreed to

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,189
we actually added Arabic so that was a

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,579
challenge because we have to be able to

00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:14,749
support the Arabic language within the

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:18,799
system and rendering but we'll we'll be

00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:21,170
going back and revisiting this over time

00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,600
so I do get calls from different geo

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,029
leaders and they say can we please add

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,579
this language and my first question is

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,069
okay what sellers do you have in place

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,679
what marketing resources do you have in

00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:36,049
place to support this new language if we

00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,589
enable it within the system we do allow

00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:42,470
our local markets to still create and

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,110
publish pages in their local language if

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,569
they have a need but they have to

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,189
totally own those pages they have to own

00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,769
the maintenance of the pages and the

00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:54,769
content for those pages and that's

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:57,980
pretty much to support local campaigns

00:09:54,769 --> 00:10:04,939
local events and they can also have

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:09,170
local case studies so part of our

00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:12,709
content strategy was to really think how

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,559
could we model our content in a simple

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,389
way that we could be really efficient in

00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,829
the way that we're deploying out to the

00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:24,980
markets so one of our areas our security

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:27,290
business unit said you know what in some

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,999
markets we only need marketing pages and

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,420
other markets it's sufficient enough if

00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:33,920
I have my product pages so if you think

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,429
about the different types of pages you

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,309
might have on your site those are two of

00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,829
our primary types of pages on our

00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:44,959
marketing sites so for our worldwide

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,230
site we have all of the content we have

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,759
the home page we have our legal pages we

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,850
have all of our worldwide marketing

00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:56,299
pages our product catalog that's full of

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,519
our product pages but as we started to

00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,980
think about the geo markets we said we

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,660
said okay let's define some tears

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,339
so the first tear is really about

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,570
replicating the worldwide site with just

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,960
a less amount of

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,780
content so maybe we have 100 pages for a

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,080
business unit on our worldwide site we

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,450
don't need all of those 100 pages on our

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,280
geo sites on our tier 1 sites so some

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:28,330
subset may be 20% 30% of those pages

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,790
would be deployed to the tier 1 market

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,550
but not out to our tier 2 or tier 3 in

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,960
the tier 2 we decided it would be

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,390
sufficient enough just to have the

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,520
product pages and then in the Minor

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:44,000
markets we really just have our ibm.com

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:47,180
homepage and a little bit of other

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,350
minimal content just to keep the content

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:57,020
fresh on a quarterly basis so we went

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,860
out to the geographies and asked them

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,350
also to classify which market fit into

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,660
which model so we define the model

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,450
centrally but then we went out to the

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,520
geographies and got them to decide on

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,100
their own which markets they wanted to

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,370
classify as tier 1 tier 2 and minor

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,580
based on their revenue targets and then

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,350
after we defined all that we again went

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,410
back to all the business unit leaders

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,470
and met with them one by one and shared

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,350
this new model and got their buy-in so

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,980
there was a lot of socializing around

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,160
the content model as well so the next

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,800
thing we did down that we had a Content

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,850
model we were trying to think how is the

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:47,900
most efficient way to manage ibm.com in

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,570
137 locales so we said what if we would

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,180
set up some of our locales to be parents

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,000
of other locales so that we would really

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,880
only have to maintain the parent but the

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,500
child look how would inherit any any

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,790
changes that we make to the parent so we

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,620
again went out to our jury about

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,900
geography Leeds and said if we set up

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,420
this structure well who would be the

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,250
parent who would be the child in your

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:17,750
markets and so each one of them defined

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,920
how they would want to be set up so for

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:24,290
in our Mia market we have UAE is

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,899
the parent for both Saudi Arabia and

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:32,620
Libya but South Africa comes directly

00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:37,040
off of our English master because we

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,019
that part of Africa their their

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,209
messaging their graphics everything

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,399
would be much different than it would be

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:48,910
in UAE and Saudi Arabia in Libya so we

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,560
set up these inheritance models and

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,290
Drupal does a really great job of

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,420
supporting us with this so I would say

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,000
that's probably that's one of the many

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,190
benefits we have from Drupal but this is

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,470
very significant because it allows us to

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:18,050
be very efficient in our management of

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:22,070
the websites okay sorry I was hitting

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,740
the wrong button so we also are doing

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,600
the same thing for other languages so

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,990
the other the previous slide was about

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,730
the English language locales we start

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,860
with our worldwide site and create our

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,589
English master kind of as our snapshot

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,560
in time that we globalize and then we

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,230
create our other language masters so

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,630
like our German language master and our

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,019
French language master and again we set

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,220
up those parent-child relationships

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:55,399
again working back with the geography

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:58,310
teams so that was our content model so

00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,649
the next thing we did was really focused

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,860
around our process and roles and how

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:07,220
could we make the globalization process

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,810
much more efficient so if you we

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,819
considered the steps the one through

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,579
nine steps of preparing for

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:15,920
globalization initiating it trans going

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,920
through translation validating your

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,170
translation approving your translation

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,399
and then moving on with creating local

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,649
pages publishing those locale pages and

00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,370
then doing optimization and localization

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:34,100
around the pages in the local market so

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,600
the places in the in our older process

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,960
that we updated

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,280
word that during our initiate phase

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,400
instead of having the worldwide teams

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,620
just shove out new pages and no one

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,960
knows about it we now require our

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,140
worldwide teams to brief our geo teams

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,390
on any changes that are coming through

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,080
the globalization process and our geo

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,300
teams have a week to raise their hand

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,600
and say hey you know that's not enough

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,960
pages or wait that's way too many pages

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,750
or ask questions about the content

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,790
that's coming to them so that's worked

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,910
out really well it's a very structured

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,520
package that we've put together but they

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,770
have to complete it's a lot of work but

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,240
the feedback we've also gotten from our

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,340
world why teams is that it's a nice

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,930
package for them but they've never

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,030
really thought of having all of that

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,790
information together at the same time

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,410
and it includes information about really

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,230
thinking about what are the assets on

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,260
the page that are being linked to what

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,780
redirects need to happen as the pages

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,880
are being deployed and a lot of other

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,720
detailed information that really helps

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,660
the our geo teams prepare the next thing

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,110
that we did different was we moved away

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,540
from translation validation and using

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,140
our in market resources marketing

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,150
resources to do that work we knew they

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,110
were rewriting the content they were

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,830
slow

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,070
it just wasn't their job so instead we

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,949
now pay our translation service to do

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:13,760
what we call translation QA and we use

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,670
new capabilities in Drupal to allow for

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,360
side-by-side comparison but also a

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:23,300
preview of the content in context so

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,790
they can look for grammar and syntax

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:29,900
issues that aren't caught during normal

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:32,090
translation so that's the space where

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,060
I'll be sharing with you a little bit

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,940
about where we did some customization

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,300
around the tea MGMT module to support

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,400
support that and then the last part that

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,080
we changed was the approving publish so

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,440
like I said before we wanted to give

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,040
ownership to our geo team so we now have

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,650
web me

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,150
integers in each of our geographies and

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,700
they're the ones that receive the

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,190
briefing materials and prepare and then

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,530
they know that the content is coming but

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,860
they have the right to publish they're

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,140
the only ones that have content approval

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:08,180
to publish the new pages live they are

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,670
also the only ones that as an update is

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,410
coming in to the local market they are

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,320
the only ones that can accept that

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:21,560
update we call it a nun localize

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:25,070
function so again we use Drupal during

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,660
that for the inheritance capabilities to

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,190
to make it much more efficient so we

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,210
don't have to have a web manager

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:41,590
assigned for all 137 look house we have

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:44,320
about 42 web managers so success we

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,090
through our process we just recently

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,680
were able to complete globalization in

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:54,440
five days for our Red Hat announcement

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,390
so think about 12 weeks down to 5 days

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,480
and I know we can even do this much

00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,730
faster there were a few reasons why we

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,880
didn't make it even faster that we're

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,650
working on now so and the goal is to

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,540
actually be able to just queue

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,580
everything up so we can launch on a

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,010
single day in all markets and we have

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:21,020
the capability to do that we just

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:23,090
haven't tested it yet so now I'm going

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,800
to talk a little bit more about Drupal

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,660
and how Drupal helps us so for the

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,770
developers you're probably familiar and

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:36,050
we're on Drupal 8 a page itself so this

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,920
is a page with all of the different lead

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:44,540
space and bands our IBM implementation

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,030
of Drupal is it's not layout it's not a

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,240
layout builder we call it page builder

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:52,670
and it's our own implementation but it's

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,860
really made up of the lead space and the

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:59,530
bands so if you think of a page as lead

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:02,120
space and bands so that aligns then to

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,750
within Drupal when we're looking at the

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,170
different bands

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:09,140
within Drupal so every band every lead

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:12,530
space is an entity and then the elements

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,910
within the band are also entities and

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:18,620
then every page is a node and then a

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,590
lead space is a node and a band is a

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:27,530
node so you're probably all familiar

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:32,480
with that so if we have our English

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:35,150
master then we move into we create an

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,950
English master from our us site so the

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,540
reason we do that is we want to allow

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,780
our worldwide teams to continue

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,910
iterating on content but we want to know

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,440
what we're globalizing is approved for

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,450
globalization like they already know

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,100
that it's performing well it's the

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,900
content that they want the Geo markets

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,510
to have and the geo markets are ready to

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,300
have it so when we create our English

00:20:53,510 --> 00:21:00,200
master we create a complete copy of

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:04,730
every node from the worldwide site and

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,620
this actually cuts the inheritance so we

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,840
can make changes on the worldwide site

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,840
without it affecting our English master

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,660
then as we build our locale pages so

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:23,330
from the English master we would create

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:25,730
our UK en page we would when we create

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,550
the locale the only thing that actually

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:31,220
gets copied is the page wrapper and none

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:36,620
of not the lead space not the bait the

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:39,050
banns but when our web manager or one of

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:43,640
our continental editors in the local

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:45,860
markets changes a band then it creates a

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,480
version of that band in that local

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:53,810
market so Drupal knows to when they're

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,690
going to when going to the UK in site to

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,790
look and see for each element of the

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,450
page the lead space and all the bands

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,940
is there a UK en version if it is if

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,110
there is it renders that if not it'll

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,150
fall back to the english master so this

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,960
is how we we use the inheritance

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,960
capabilities

00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:25,360
this is another part of Drupal that we

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:29,740
enhanced is the T mg mg module the

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,100
translation module and we set it up so

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,360
that we can send content off for

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:40,810
translation to our IBM in-house

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:45,010
translation service provider and it

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:46,810
comes back in we put in we send it it we

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:50,680
were able to send an X lift and it also

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:53,260
includes a JSON file with our operations

00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,620
data and this is really an important

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,330
element because that's the information

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,060
that's used to Bill

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,250
so what every time we send a translation

00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,490
to our service provider we have to pay

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,530
for it so it wasn't a matter of just

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,150
figuring out how to send the page we

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,580
also had to figure out how to send the

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,730
financial information so that we could

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,340
be billed on the back end so that's all

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:21,910
sent over it comes back in to them the

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,270
module we then have to API is someone

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:28,800
API sends out information to get

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,690
segments so that we can have then our

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,200
reviewers look side-by-side and Drupal

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,840
to see that the segment's and then also

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,840
we can look at a whole preview of a page

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,710
and then when we up when we decide to

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:48,580
approve the page we use this other API

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:50,590
that sends out looks at the whole is

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,320
able to assemble all the content back

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,690
into a whole translation unit so

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,330
translation unit is putting the

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,010
segment's back together that have been

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,740
taken apart in the process of

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:07,150
translation and this allows our our

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,450
translation QA specialists to look at

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,600
all the content in context so you'll the

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,330
next slide will start video it is going

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,580
to be a pretty long demo it's about 14

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,160
minutes so I warn you but it's an marie

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,750
walking through the whole globalization

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,750
process so you can see how it works

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:35,650
I'm going to start at our master English

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,360
language of the cloud red hat page and

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,800
request the translation into our master

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,290
German and step through the workflow so

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,980
here we're looking at the master English

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:51,800
version of the IBM Red Hat page clicking

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,990
on the Translate tab opens our list of

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,710
languages that are available for

00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:01,670
translation and localization I'm going

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:06,350
to locate the master German translation

00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:09,970
and select the request translation so

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:12,890
selecting the language with our TM VMT

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:17,840
and trip module enables we can click

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:19,850
request translation clicking request

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,640
translation will take us to the checkout

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,040
form where we're going to look at our

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,680
custom IBM translation service provider

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,060
and the operational data and check that

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,060
settings that are required

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,790
sometimes it's a little slow this is a

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,790
development server

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,659
on the checkout form I'll enter a label

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:13,509
and select our translation provider this

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,639
is the pre-production environment on the

00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:18,039
right hand side based on our content

00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:21,100
model all of the entity references are

00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,480
included as additional job items to send

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,480
in the same request translation packet

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,000
as part of our checkout settings I'm

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,700
required to submit a domain purging

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,130
agent charging code and business unit

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,919
this is all operational data that's

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,809
required to submit from the IBM Drupal

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:46,419
instance through to our translation

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:49,029
service provider I'll select cloud are

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:53,230
keeping our Drupal 8 as the charging

00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:55,629
agent enter in my test charge code in

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,379
the business unit and the translation

00:26:55,629 --> 00:27:02,500
contact is pre-populated with my ID and

00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:05,889
click Submit to provider as part of this

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:10,090
process we're now submitting the

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:14,889
translation ex live outbound as well as

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:17,350
a JSON with the operational data taking

00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:20,710
a look at the operational data you can

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:24,159
see that the raw JSON submits the job ID

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,039
the job title the domain business unit

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,649
charging agent urgent code and the

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,419
contact email as part of the JSON must

00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:39,629
post it to the endpoint as well as the

00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:41,950
outbound JSON we also have our outbound

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:44,230
excellent file that has all of the

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,350
translatable units as part of the

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,539
content model and the content type

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:53,409
defined as our source language the end

00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:58,659
and all of the translatable strings sent

00:27:53,409 --> 00:28:02,559
to the translation provider I have as

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:06,840
part of this demo previously submitted a

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,490
translation to both master Italian and

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,120
master French and have processed them

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,950
through various stages of the workflow

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,289
once the translation job has been

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,149
processed by the service provider it's

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,809
returned into Drupal and coming

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:25,269
with a workflow status of moods review

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:28,539
clicking on manage the job it opens up

00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:30,549
our manage job form showing us all of

00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:34,869
the job items that were included in that

00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:36,789
package and our content editors for this

00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:40,179
master language can click on edit -

00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:44,889
translation which opens our side-by-side

00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:49,450
comparison form a quick scan of this

00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:54,039
shows us all of the segmentation JSON

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:56,859
and its source on the left and our

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:59,499
translations of the right as a

00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:02,440
translation QA specialist for this

00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:05,249
master language they can review side by

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:10,599
side each of the translations and

00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:13,450
validate for correctness if there's any

00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,759
additional updates they can make be made

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,659
here and be resubmitted back to the

00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:22,269
translation provider we can also do a

00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:25,659
preview of the translation clicking on

00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,099
preview will save a draft of any edits

00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,460
that are made as part of the

00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:32,799
side-by-side editing experience and will

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,669
be available in context than rendering

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,869
so here we can see this is now the

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:44,379
Italian translation for the IBM Red Hat

00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:47,499
page and we can see if there's any

00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:49,889
Corrections errors or omissions or any

00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:54,549
updates that need you need to depart to

00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:57,789
approving the translation once the

00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:00,759
translation has been reviewed any

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:04,149
Corrections made you can submit for

00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:06,309
review from the comparison forum the

00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:08,950
translation QA specialists can submit

00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:13,239
this translation through to the approver

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:16,269
for this master language I have as part

00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:19,389
of a previous translation processed the

00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:21,940
master French into the status so the

00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:25,629
status changes from needs review to

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,509
needs approval from this point we can

00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:31,599
manage the translation job for the

00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:33,050
approval state the difference on our

00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,300
overview form is

00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:39,620
it's no longer an edit to translation

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:42,680
but a review translation clicking on

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:46,460
review translation opens our comparison

00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,880
form in a read-only state for our

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:54,500
translation approvals we can also

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:57,470
preview the translation and see again in

00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:01,550
context prior to approving the

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:04,850
translation our translation editors in

00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:08,900
the contextual rendering of the preview

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,540
can see the job information and we have

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,430
this moderation bar that's available to

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,460
allow them to approve the translation

00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:19,450
while they're previewing within context

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:22,730
they can also from the comparison form

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:26,060
approve the translation both will

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,360
publish and move all of the job items

00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:32,510
into an accepted State and publish the

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,220
master language translation any

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,970
Corrections that will have been made

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,410
will be submitted through to our

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:42,890
translation service provider and will

00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:48,110
update and validate those translations

00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:51,020
in memory doing so will mean that a

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:53,650
second translation requests for the same

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,990
segment will come back as a validated

00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:01,810
translation I will not need to go back

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:05,530
through the translation QA process again

00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:09,950
so now that we have approved our

00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:14,210
translations we can have our locale

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:18,080
editors use our master languages to

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:24,110
create localized versions of the IBM

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:27,800
RedHat page I'm going to start with our

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:34,160
master English and create one of our

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:38,090
tier 1 locales for the IBM cloud RedHat

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,120
page and I'll create the UK version of

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:43,610
the page

00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:48,070
from the Translate tab again we see the

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:51,730
list of all of the available locales I'm

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,980
going to choose the United Kingdom and

00:32:51,730 --> 00:33:00,470
instead of a request translation I'm

00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:04,130
going to do an ad for locale clicking on

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:07,100
ads will open up the Edit form for this

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,039
page the first choice that our local

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,529
content editors make is what is the

00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:17,990
parent source language that they want to

00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:19,909
use and inherit the content from this is

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,269
a list of all the published languages

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:26,899
and locales for en UK I'm going to

00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:31,340
choose the English master and click on

00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:35,120
confirm at this point all of the content

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,639
fields are we only until they confirm

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,779
which language they want to source those

00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:43,519
link those fields from I can now see

00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:47,450
that my source language has been set to

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:52,190
English master the locale of this node

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:54,320
entity is UK en and all of my entity

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,679
references as part of the content model

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,690
are sourced from my parent source

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:05,059
language which is EMU master English so

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,490
Leeds face and band are all source for

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:14,050
master English click Save and preview

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:18,530
will show that my rendering logic is

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:22,490
going to check for the current entity in

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:26,179
its language code and if it doesn't find

00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:30,889
a revision or that translation language

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:33,830
it will fall back to the current source

00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,859
language master English and render its

00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:39,919
revision so here I have my Leeds face

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:44,179
and I also have my band which is

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:47,659
inheriting from master English if a

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:50,690
locale wants to choose to localize one

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:53,600
of its content items so if I want to do

00:34:50,690 --> 00:35:03,680
an override of my inheritance

00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:10,010
I can click Edit and I will edit the

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:12,550
lead space and create a localization we

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:16,910
now we can see that the source is still

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:19,850
inheriting from master English and I

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:24,830
will simply add UK that's part of my

00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:31,760
headline and we see we have the option

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:34,310
to localize this lead space once I've

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,370
clicked localizes lead space we now have

00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:40,910
a localized language variant of this

00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,900
need space and to be reference in the

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,510
source language of en UK save and

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,260
preview picks up on my rendering logic

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:54,080
where it will check do i have an en UK

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:58,450
revision for this translation effective

00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:03,560
yes then let's render it instead of

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:05,720
inheriting the master english this

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,870
process works for all of our languages

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,440
and their locales so even our translated

00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,440
languages

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:39,090
so if I choose to create a localized

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:41,730
version of my Spanish from you'll see

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:47,610
that it's inherited from my master

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:54,570
Spanish and you can see that this locale

00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:58,340
for Spain is inheriting all of its

00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:04,350
master language from the translation of

00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:08,220
yes should this locale want to create a

00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:14,310
localization this process would be the

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:18,780
same and here we see the source is

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:21,680
masters damaged great

00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,680
edit

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,980
and in this case I'm also going to

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:45,730
remove the call to actions in the lead

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:50,140
space so in addition to making content

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:54,600
edits they can also add or remove custom

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,600
content entity references on the page

00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:08,880
and I'll click localize this need space

00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:08,880
and Steven preview

00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:20,980
so while this translated locale is

00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:24,820
taking advantage of the to wage and

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,710
approved master Spanish translation they

00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,530
also have the flexibility of being able

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:32,530
to add and removes custom blocks from

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:38,770
their page as well as localized any of

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:41,230
the content on the for their locale so

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:44,070
with the use of a custom translation

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:47,650
provider with our side-by-side

00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:51,640
translation QA process storing

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:56,110
translated memory or segmentation

00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:00,840
of our translatable units of our content

00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:03,790
models as well as the ability to reuse

00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,320
master languages translation at the

00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:10,540
locales this all gives us the benefit of

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,610
faster time-to-market for bringing

00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:19,270
localized versions of our content for

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:21,880
drupal thank you so now I'm just gonna

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,580
take you really quickly through some of

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,940
the updates the customizations that have

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,890
been done for our drupal system and

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,390
again this these are an maurice charts

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,690
so i'm gonna do the best to represent

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,890
them for her but we also have contact

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,600
information at the end of the

00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,480
presentation if you want to reach out to

00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:44,500
her and I'm sure she will be glad to go

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,540
into more detail with you so one of the

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,820
we really looked at several different

00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:51,010
things to enable the core and the

00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:54,640
supporting contributes and I'll go in

00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:57,790
each of these on detailed slides so the

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
first one is that it's really important

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:02,740
to get your content ready for

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,680
globalization so for each content model

00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:09,390
our development teams for each of our

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:15,360
different page types have to define

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,360
which let me turn this down sorry

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:23,300
which what the English link of the

00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:26,090
content is what the translated length

00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,500
can be if the content can be localized

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:32,510
and also if it's a required field so

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,550
this has actually been one of our issues

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,680
during globalization that have has

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,530
gotten us into trouble if the

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,120
development teams aren't defining these

00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,160
sometimes we've had failures when we

00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,530
send our content out to translation and

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,600
back because the content coming back is

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,700
too big for the field so that's a really

00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,960
important thing for developers to focus

00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:55,550
on so we've written she's written a

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,780
whole module around this to help with

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:03,050
that and this again is about the

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,180
character length as well making sure

00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:11,630
this is the actual module that checks

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:14,840
the link before it goes out she's also

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:18,590
developed her and her team modules to

00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:22,070
support the localization so since we

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,260
need to know whether a published version

00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:27,790
in the CMS is a language master which

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:31,120
will not render versus a locale version

00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:34,700
there's code that actually sets that so

00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:39,110
if it's a master language it results in

00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,570
a in a false and then if it's if it's a

00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,330
locale it it renders a true so for any

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,920
places where we need that information

00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:51,940
we're able to have that coded within the

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,940
system to pick up to know how to render

00:41:52,060 --> 00:42:00,170
also the content inheritance so having a

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,660
way with our translation helper to know

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,580
all those inheritance so when I said

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,310
we've asked the Geo teams to define the

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,200
parent and the children that's all

00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,630
defined within the system and there's a

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,730
module that goes knows to go look for

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:20,360
that as far as the rendering our

00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,170
outbound translation request so this is

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,200
in that

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,289
TMG mt so this is the the extra

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,690
customization module that was created to

00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:32,549
send the content to our internal

00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,200
translation service provider and bring

00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:39,750
it back in the format that we need

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:42,030
within the module and then this is the

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:47,960
piece that pulls the pieces the

00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:50,730
segment's back together and helps us do

00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,910
make sure at the end of the process we

00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,980
we update our translation cache and I

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:59,670
didn't talk as much about that as I

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,319
wanted to but we want to send we want to

00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,390
make sure every time we do a translation

00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,420
and the reason we're using translation

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,280
QA team members we don't want to change

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,770
the messaging we want to have an exact

00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,630
translation and we want to optimize that

00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,640
during this process so that over time

00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:17,400
our translation memories are being

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,450
optimized overall driving down our

00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,400
translation costs so we won't as we see

00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,930
the same term

00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,569
well it'll be handled by machine

00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:33,470
learning versus having to have a human

00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:37,140
involved and this is the side by side

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:39,450
module capability that was built in to

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:44,460
allow our translation QA team members to

00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:48,329
do that side-by-side validation this is

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:50,160
the assembling back API again all this

00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:54,720
will be all there for you to reference

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,849
and finally I just want to say so the

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,849
key sub steps to success are really

00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,859
first understanding what your business

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:03,599
problems are with globalization that

00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:06,359
you're trying to resolve and then

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,720
developing a strategy around to solve

00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:12,900
for that including KPIs so we knew we

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,819
want to get to two weeks as for every

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,819
one of our globalization projects as a

00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:20,369
maximum so we've got our eye on the on

00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:23,460
that goal and everything we're doing is

00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:26,460
trying to get to that goal we then

00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,799
aligned our processes to the strategy we

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,559
aligned our roles and responsibilities

00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,770
and our staffing to our processes and

00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,839
then we implemented

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:39,230
functionality within the platform to

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:43,550
support all of our needs so that's what

00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:45,140
I have to share and we've got some

00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:50,060
connection information if you want to

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:54,109
get in touch and don't forget to go to

00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:56,750
contribution tomorrow and we'd love to

00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:59,900
have your feedback on the session so

00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:09,740
thank you and I can take questions if

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:17,140
anyone has questions I can't tell if

00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:17,140
there's okay let you

00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:57,400
no I can I can hear you I think so

00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,789
we actually have divested of our content

00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:05,859
management system and so when we were

00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:11,079
looking at choosing a CMS I think we we

00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:14,740
knew that was happening and we probably

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:17,339
had about 50 people across our marketing

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:21,880
organizations and our engineering teams

00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:26,380
involved in reviewing input from several

00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:28,559
different vendors aqueous was the one

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,940
who presented Drupal and and aqueous

00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,289
ultimately the vendor we chose to get

00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:37,240
started with for our implementation and

00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:40,960
if you want to learn more about that the

00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:44,890
Seattle recording for Drupal con there's

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,579
a how to how to get big blue to dance I

00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,750
think is the topic title so you can

00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:53,680
learn more a little bit more about that

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:56,950
but we also were looking for an open

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,589
source solution our engineers wanted a

00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:02,440
solution that they could customize and

00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:05,680
they can contribute back to the

00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,299
community and so we just wanted

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,970
something that would address our needs

00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:13,029
and the inheritance capabilities of

00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:16,109
Drupal I don't know if any other system

00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:19,089
has that but that's really been

00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:25,630
important for us as far as our marketing

00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:28,710
efficiency goals any other questions

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,710
I'm here

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:45,420
WebSphere so there's probably more irony

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:50,999
now in this than comprehend things

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:53,700
they're always changing so we've had a

00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:55,470
long journey now with Drupal already and

00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,930
we're actually now going through a

00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,599
similar exercise where we are changing

00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:03,359
our approach from having almost 60

00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:08,069
so-called full sites into these kind of

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:11,249
tiers so I'm interested to learn more

00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:13,980
about how you made the decisions and got

00:48:11,249 --> 00:48:16,109
the buy-in because my experience is that

00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:19,920
if you ask people have a strong

00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:21,809
inclination towards you know let's keep

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,549
the status quo we want to have the full

00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:26,480
side so how you were able to get the

00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:30,359
buy-in and able to move into these tiers

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,599
I think data is the key like data was

00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:36,660
our our source and our friend we you

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,910
know had our our research team really

00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:42,029
look do a deep analysis and come back

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:44,880
with data we could go to the marketing

00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:46,739
teams and wherever there was any kind of

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,239
pushback we said okay well let's look at

00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,910
your data let's look at your traffic

00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,890
let's look at your revenue let's look at

00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:57,690
your resources let's look at the numbers

00:48:52,890 --> 00:49:01,049
and so just focusing on data it took all

00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:03,210
the emotional emotion out of it like was

00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:06,059
the best approach okay great so that's

00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,319
our plan so hopefully it sounds like

00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:14,160
we're doing the right thing so thanks

00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:17,670
okay any other questions great well

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,489
thank you all and thank you for the

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,869
video going through the video and uh

00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,460
thanks for a great Drupal con this is my

00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:26,359
first one like I said before it's been

00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,359
