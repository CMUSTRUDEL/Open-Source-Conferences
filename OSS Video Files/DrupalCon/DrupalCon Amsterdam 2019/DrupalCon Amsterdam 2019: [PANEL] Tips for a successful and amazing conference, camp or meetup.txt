hi everyone and welcome to tips for a

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:10,620
successful and amazing conference camp

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,920
or meetup or other gathering this is who

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,559
we are

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,350
my name is Jordana son I'm from Suriname

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,869
South America I speak Dutch and English

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,529
as you can tell from me speaking English

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,119
right now so if we can go ahead and say

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,949
hi everybody and if you speak different

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,230
languages please say you do David hi

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,859
everyone my name is David my from

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,090
Switzerland

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,559
I speak English German and Spanish so if

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,090
you want to talk about something feel

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:46,950
free to come to me Mike from the United

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,219
States I'm a slopper language usually

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,410
well I'm coming from the United States

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,469
as well I also speak redneck so I am

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,039
from Barcelona I speak

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,719
funny

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,719
she's cut off and

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:16,880
Brian Guilbert from Australia and

00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:19,429
Australia so the one thing we all have

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,520
in common is that the most important

00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:26,149
thing we feel to have a successful camp

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,179
is to create create and maintain safe

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,740
spaces so I'm gonna leave the resources

00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:32,329
slide up here so you can always make

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,000
pictures and we're gonna go through them

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,140
a little bit and the whole flow of this

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,590
is more gonna be more of a conversation

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,209
on things we consider important than

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,659
things we've learned along the way

00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:46,039
so if whenever you have questions after

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,149
we've when we're going through some of

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:51,819
these please feel free to ask those so

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,319
the first step to creating a safe space

00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,360
we feel is to have a code of conduct

00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,969
because then you're making your rules

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,369
known you're explicitly stating the

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,739
things that are allowed and not allowed

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:06,349
but more important than that we feel is

00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,729
code of conduct enforcement because the

00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:13,190
code of conduct is nothing if you don't

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:15,200
enforce it so we've seen it happen a lot

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,660
unfortunately that people have a code of

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
conduct and that when people come up to

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,970
them their concerns are oftentimes

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,200
dismissed and this is one of the biggest

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,079
mistakes you can make us a camp

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,239
organiser is to minimize someone's

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,950
concerns because to you something might

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,840
not be big it might not be important but

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,989
it's that person it is and to many

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,099
others it might be so this is something

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,720
that we learn more about in a code of

00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,739
conduct training that we are organizing

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,720
and I can talk a little bit about that I

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,730
want to mention the links up there are

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,940
case sensitive

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,099
so with the COC AMS is the capital see

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,380
little to make sure that the entitlement

00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,690
dark

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,580
so I will say I'm kind of wearing and

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,890
turnout as well two of us are kind of

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,349
wearing two hats right now both camp

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,209
organizers and we're also exactly half

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:13,390
of the triple community working group

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:15,730
who is our mission is to help ensure a

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,780
safe community and a healthy community

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:24,080
so one of the things that we have done

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,870
recently in the past year so we've been

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,370
hearing for a while that camp organizers

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,880
including myself I am one of the

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,280
organizers of the Florida camp we wanted

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,170
to have some resources to make it easy

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,900
for camp organizers to provide all of

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,080
the code of conduct enforcement to if

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,010
possible so with that in mind we've

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
actually announced and released three

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,239
major issues over the past year related

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,670
to that and those three things are

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,819
number one we there's now a code of

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,370
conduct template for Drupal events that

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,620
you can go if you click on this link the

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,799
first link up there thank you if you

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:11,359
click on the link to roger page with

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,769
that template it has you can do a bunch

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,680
of search replace but we have to

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,870
encourage camps to read through it and

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:24,690
adjust it based on

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:26,940
their camp and the local culture item

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,190
number two is what we call the total

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,690
count at play block which is goes to

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,850
what tornados talking about a second ago

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,440
is okay but what happens if there is

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,320
some type of insane

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,180
how do you handle it so the playbook

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,530
actually has some scenarios and some

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,310
best practices and we actually worked

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:51,570
with a lot of camp organizers to develop

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,610
that and we're actually looking to find

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,139
some folks to help us maintain now and

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,639
to make it an additional content for

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,320
non-english speaking parts of the world

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,260
we've to translate it into other

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,150
languages as well and then the third

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,639
aspect of it which were I'm pretty

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,320
excited about we started a few months

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,500
ago we partnered with a company called

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,900
honor tech and again we realize it's

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,970
very us in English centric

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:23,820
we are trying to find non-english

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,570
speaking trainings that offer a similar

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:31,050
content we have been unsuccessful so far

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,770
but it's a half day training for code of

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,080
conduct contacts so a lot of people have

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,120
been to events and an opening session

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,830
you'll see a slide that lists the code

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,070
of conduct to contacts if there's an

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,750
incident talk to this person well these

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,720
people need to have some type of

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,460
training other than you know having read

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,500
the code of conduct or maybe having read

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,419
our playbook so we partnered with the

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,380
company that provides specifically this

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,560
type of training

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,650
than what we're doing this is how people

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,560
graduate or complete that training we

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,920
are posting their names you know at a

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,040
link off this link up here in hopes that

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,530
these people will become sought-after to

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,930
attend more events as the better

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,510
organizer I want all of our code of

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,460
conduct trainings cuts our code of

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:25,620
conduct contact to complete this

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,660
training because we feel if you can

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,470
demonstrate that you're taking it

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,910
seriously and that it's not just a you

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,320
know something you copy and pasted from

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,840
somewhere else and threw it up on your

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,220
website if you can demonstrate that you

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,430
put in time and thought and effort and

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,570
care into it not my definition will

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,510
create a safer and more inclusive

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,140
environment and to be fair like we're

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,060
cwg we are in the CWG so we deal with

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,340
these kind of things often and I did the

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,690
training already and I you still get

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,000
stuff out of it there's still stuff we

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,160
learn from it so it's something a very

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,420
valuable resource for anybody even if

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,380
you don't think you need and if you

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:13,140
don't think you need it you might need

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:16,040
it even more to be honest and our

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,710
twitter handles are on here as well so

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,010
so piggybacking on that the whole thing

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,300
about a code of conduct and problems at

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,950
your camp you're not going to know about

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,750
them if people don't feel safe to come

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,790
up to you and talk about them this is

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,950
another thing about why minimizing it is

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,320
such a bad thing and when about the

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,720
training on realizing like how to handle

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,740
it when somebody comes to you because

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,100
when somebody comes to you with a

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,620
concern they're calling in right they're

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,590
coming in to dirt and they're coming to

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,240
you to address that concern

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,120
privately don't give them a reason to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,450
publicly call you out on it take care of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,620
it

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,750
handle it take it seriously

00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,280
so another great thing about this is

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,320
having a code of conduct and being a

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,450
good enforcer of it is it creates a safe

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,610
space for diversity and inclusion and a

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,500
great way of getting more speakers and a

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,270
more diverse speaker is the camp

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,590
organizer speaker diversity workshop you

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,900
might have heard that in the keynote and

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,150
in keynote initiative stay like our King

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,410
this is also an amazing training and

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,330
this is they're doing a train the

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,710
trainer's workshop so that you can teach

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:28,180
others to give those that training and

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:33,520
another way of encouraging things is

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,780
about well first off you guys stop me if

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,880
there's anything you kind of want to

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:42,820
chime in with by the way so what we tend

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,340
to do is learn a lot from each other and

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,710
a way to learn a lot is the recording

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,210
initiative so Kevin Thal is doing all of

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,010
the recordings here and he's back there

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,810
so you could see him there in the purple

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,880
shirt he's always looking for people to

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,360
learn and relearn the recording

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,550
initiative and volunteer so how do you

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:07,480
guys handle like looking for volunteers

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:09,730
and sure so one thing I have learned

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,130
recently as someone who is in a position

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,830
of privilege the white guy in America

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,110
gets a lot of freebies I have learned

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,420
that putting the code of conduct in

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,000
place gives other people this security

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,750
to come to your event when they may have

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,580
had bad experiences that other

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,110
in the past so you may never actually

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,180
have to deal with a code of conduct

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,040
issue but if you're like well we'll have

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,440
one whenever we actually run into an

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,170
issue you're missing out on some people

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,160
that don't feel safe because there isn't

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,420
that measure of oh this is how it

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,400
happens something gets dealt with

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,410
because they've already experienced it

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,600
and they've already had that bomb I've

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,520
never had to experience that so I'm on

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,890
the other side going why do we need a

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,630
code of conduct until something actually

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,920
happens let's not worry about it

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,470
but there are a lot of people who've had

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,970
that experience in the past who are

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,730
missing your event because they're like

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,800
well maybe something will happen to me

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:09,380
and I won't know how to deal with it so

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,600
yeah it's a way of ensuring safety Kevin

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:28,040
the questions out there should the red

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:30,290
light be on on the button no it's this

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,330
is why Kevin she wants more volunteers

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:42,320
to do the training to be able to do this

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:45,230
in Europe a lot more as well the

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,610
recording initiative is besides giving a

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,680
lot of people access to your content

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,210
that wouldn't never normally get it it's

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,450
a good way of promoting your camp or

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,390
conference or Meetup in speaking of

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,060
promoting David you have an interesting

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,260
way of promoting your camp would you

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,700
like to talk about that a little bit I'm

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,180
sure

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,220
basically I'm the organizer of Drupal

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,700
mountain camp in Davos which takes place

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,310
every second year and this the last time

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,130
this year we actually sent out a survey

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,680
and asking our our attendees what did

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,509
they like what

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,670
to look better and I think that's

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,589
something that you should do for every

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,410
camp for every means of engage your

00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,089
community get your feedback and don't

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,670
set them like a forum with 20 questions

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,160
but a simple one where we get like one

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,769
to three important questions so you can

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,189
because it's all about iteration proving

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,050
and you can happen Anna fort but the

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:43,929
community also has their own thoughts on

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,959
ideas that can help you to improve your

00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:49,240
camp or meetup or what whatever event it

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,309
is and a lot of people actually

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,709
responded that they really liked the

00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,360
host there's no two mountains and they

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,420
would say they would like to stay longer

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,149
so we thought about how could can we

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,910
combine this together like doing Drupal

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,360
and meeting other people that also bring

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,819
more stuff being enjoying the pose and

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,089
for the coming Drupal and camp in 2021

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:16,029
we are actually now offering different

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:18,879
packages so you can steal by your normal

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,040
camp ticket but if you want to stay

00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:25,449
let's say for one week in Davos you can

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,519
order a specific thicker there we have

00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:29,649
like four different packages published

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,759
on the website group among kept top ch

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:35,980
sorry but for example there's a partner

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,829
she weekend so you can come with your

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,920
significant order and what you are doing

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:45,069
the Drupal staff and your partner can go

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,339
to the key or to have to some hiking

00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:50,529
enjoy the horse or whatever we are also

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,779
offering a package for families because

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,819
we don't want to miss out because of the

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:56,740
terms of why don't you take the children

00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:00,129
with you where we are offering them an

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,230
apartment so they can take income for

00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,850
people to maybe two children to parents

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,769
and just enjoy the boughs and plant more

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,999
and of course we do have black stone

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:16,089
work onyx package so you will get access

00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:19,240
to a co-working space in the woods

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,949
prior to the vine so you can code during

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,199
the day and have fun in the evening

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,269
already before the camp and that's

00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,110
something that came out actually from

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,300
the after

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,100
the feedback from the community at they

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,440
said we want we would like to have this

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,260
we thought about possibilities and this

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,120
is the result now that's amazing it's a

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,910
nice interesting out-of-the-box way of

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,649
approaching it and all from engaging

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,649
your community so this is really nice

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,769
okay and speaking about engaging your

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,459
community sustainability is a big thing

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:56,910
for cap organizers being able to

00:13:54,459 --> 00:14:01,600
continue in doing it every year and

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:05,500
preventing burnout so Christina do you

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,480
have some yeah so these are one of the

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,860
problems when you're organizing the

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,810
conference is that you are not

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:16,600
organizing just one conference you are

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:20,810
doing a lot of things some problems and

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:25,260
can come after that

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:28,170
burnout you really need to know where

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,930
you can get to you're not - no you're

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,880
really need to learn to say you know you

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,100
really need to know where your limits

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,440
are and then training other people

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,630
explain our people how to do these

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,260
things

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:46,290
teach them then after that someone else

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,829
can come up after you and take over the

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,510
organization because of our wives if you

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:55,410
are born out they're just going to live

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,870
with our moment so that's one of the

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,240
main things

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,110
just always trying to keep an eye and

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,360
eye

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,760
having a successor or something like

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,760
that or someone else that has your home

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,209
so I can talk a little bit about that as

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,649
happened in Australia so I've been

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:20,980
running the Drupal meetups

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:23,050
in Melbourne since 2009 and for the

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,149
entire time since then basically and

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,550
we've tried with we've run multiple

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,750
camps and we've had real feathers and a

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,389
bunch of people who wanted to get

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,690
involved and we were always yes get

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:39,899
involved and then after that and no one

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:41,829
did and eventually they made up

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,130
participation started the decline of it

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:47,310
so I cut back to having quarterly

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,660
meetups instead of monthly meetups and

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,670
then eventually I stopped for any

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,259
meetups it was the only way I could get

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,709
someone to step up was to create a voice

00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,899
and it's happened just recently so you

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,870
know sometimes despite all your efforts

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,310
to try and do succession planning you

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,990
can't find someone who's going to step

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,850
up and do that you might just have to

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,699
step away

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,060
but as a alternate that the Sydney

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,769
community actually flew me up to Sydney

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,620
to help mediate an issue that they had

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:22,040
where the leadership was not seen as

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,769
being and the structure they did was

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,899
they actually have people only run to

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,610
meet ups and then so they have like a

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,809
bunch of people who were involved and

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,939
you did two minutes and then someone

00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:33,139
else goes next to

00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:38,389
trying to not beat the only person who

00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:40,699
doesn't reading out here leadership is a

00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:43,100
really good way to prevent burnout the

00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,170
WordPress foundation actually enforces

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,529
this so if you want to wear in a weird

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,779
camp you can only be the lead volunteer

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,670
or lead organizer for two years running

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,379
and then you have to hand that off to

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,839
some house so it forces you from the

00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,009
outset to be planning hey which of the

00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,720
people that are volunteering right now

00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,980
are going to help keep this running if

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,230
you really think about something that

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,000
you want to keep going and having I

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,799
think having an end date makes it less

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,709
scary for the next person taking over

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,679
mid camp does is that the lead organizer

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:16,069
can do it twice and then they have to

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,539
hand it off yeah so someone has been

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,539
organized in a gerbil camper

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not burned out yet I can see where

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,770
it would be a problem the thing I have

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,840
done there is one member of the Florida

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,220
community here so don't she's not being

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,220
paid tell anyone I'm saying

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,269
but so what I've been doing is I have

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,340
slowly been the danger I think is where

00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,480
the lead organizer there's almost two

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,899
things that can happen where the lead

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,059
organizer has a bit of a like a control

00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:59,000
issue where they feel like they have to

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,289
be involved in everything or if they

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,299
don't do it's not going to get done

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:07,700
right so you definitely have to embrace

00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:11,000
the the idea of giving people authority

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,919
with responsibilities if someone's going

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,500
to be in charge of t-shirts don't

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,090
micromanage what they're doing let them

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,480
do their thing and stay out of their way

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,789
so what I so there's there's three main

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,409
organizers of our camp and what I try

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:27,470
and do especially the other two

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:29,029
organizers and for myself as well is if

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,909
I see the other two organizers are

00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,710
taking too much on themselves I will try

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,110
and cut that off very other things

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,970
you're doing too much like if we can't

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,539
find someone else to do this thing then

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,970
this thing is not going to happen so I'm

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:47,210
very much all about just spreading out

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,250
the load so that if one of the three men

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,279
organizers does choose to walk away it's

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,360
not going to be catastrophic sure there

00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,899
might be some roles that needs to be

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,039
filled but it's not something where

00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:00,200
everything is on one person's shoulders

00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,710
but I still I mean I 10 punishing camps

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,809
I see a few camps that still run that

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,450
way and you know I always try and talk

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,159
to the organizers say you gotta you know

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,700
let go you're gonna let go a little bit

00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,190
and share the load otherwise you know

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,870
can't kid something you know not pr1

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,289
here

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,909
and so the Florida group has been doing

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,730
a lot of interesting thing with things

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:28,190
with their meetups so we are digitally

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,019
based right we know about remote things

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,140
but we don't use it as much as we should

00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:34,730
probably so the meat of the drupal if

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,590
florida is pretty a big state it's

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,909
pretty spread out so what they've been

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,470
doing is they've been doing online

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:46,909
meetups so every every month yeah so

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,490
basically different in Florida we really

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:52,159
tried to free maintenance one you know

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,620
purple group the entire state which you

00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,149
can drive from you know Pensacola Key

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,830
West will pick you up in 15 hours

00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:01,760
something crazy so there's a big range

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,919
but that we don't have different

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,980
geographic regions not make up their own

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,230
smaller meetups so we saw the problem of

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,320
where meetup attendance we're starting

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,169
to decline some not all of geographic

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,299
regions we're still having meetups or

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,700
regularly so we decided was someone in

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:22,760
our community stepped up and said I will

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,840
organize monthly online meetups and we

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,000
rotate it between geographic regions so

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,559
the geographic region right now well I'm

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,649
an in-person meet up that will be

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:38,809
broadcast Google hangout to primarily

00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:41,480
for folks of Florida and the so it gets

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,549
rotated by geographic region so even if

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,279
that you know let's say the Miami group

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,500
isn't leaving every month we can through

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,809
this program these came to me about

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,220
twice a year to host a

00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,889
so we kind of keep the momentum going

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,260
that way so those Korea create the

00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,980
practice rounds and increase

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,179
opportunities for people like me at

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,909
store and I'm where I don't have a

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,880
meetup group where I can just go to the

00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:10,149
Florida one online I mention that we

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,330
also alleviate the greatest issue I had

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:22,779
was organizing presentations brainy are

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:23,679
much larger so um all right talk about

00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:27,130
sustainability

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,470
uh Doug you spoke about worth a little

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,690
bit so you have gone through a lot of

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,760
work camps and have done meetups for

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,500
WordPress right yeah have you noticed

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,630
any big differences or things you can

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,799
learn from each other

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,289
absolutely I think one of the biggest

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,370
differences that's really obvious if you

00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:46,130
serve between both communities like

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,200
is that Drupal cons are quite the

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,680
production they're very well put

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,780
together

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,030
they're very extensive they've occupied

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,559
most of a week there are a lot of

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,050
trainings in a lot of sessions and

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,820
there's some pretty in-depth trainings

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,680
at the beginning where you can go learn

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,900
gatsby for almost an entire day or

00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,380
things like that in the WordPress

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:09,110
community even the big cons tend to be

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,440
camped like in there more sitting on a

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,660
weekend and they're not the same level

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,650
of production on the flip side of that

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,710
Drupal camps are very hit-or-miss like

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,420
the quality is very very different

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:27,530
because they're much more organic and

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,120
much more local community the resources

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,970
that are available are very different so

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,650
I think WordPress has tried to build

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,380
things from the ground up from the camp

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,700
sign up up and they may mature into a

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,880
bigger conference and I think the other

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,200
things have gone the other direction in

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,429
Drupal and WordPress foundation actually

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,720
partners with global sponsors and this

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:49,460
is something I would totally steal from

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,559
them they go and they find a bunch of

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,320
hosting companies and they get the

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,700
sponsorship from GoDaddy for all of the

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,280
work camps that are going to be done

00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,540
through the entire year and so the

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,730
GoDaddy writes them a check for a

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,830
hundred thousand dollars and now instead

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,620
of a hundred word camps going and asking

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,660
GoDaddy for a thousand dollars

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,309
GoDaddy has had to write one check to

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,800
one nonprofit by the way that makes the

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:14,450
accounting much easier for them and you

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,010
don't have to go form a non-profit with

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,480
your local camp so they've got some

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,700
overhead and some structure through the

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,520
foundation that makes it easier so when

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,039
I go is a word camp organizer

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,870
and I sign up I know I'm gonna get my 40

00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:28,120
dollar ticket price for people to sign

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,919
up for the work in and I also know I'm

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,450
gonna get eighty dollars from all those

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,309
key sponsors

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,990
I still have to go find a couple of

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,000
sponsors but it's also really easy to go

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,860
find sponsors when you say hey I already

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,409
have five sponsors I only need two more

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,970
it's much easier to gain those last

00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,350
couple of sponsors to pick that up so

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,320
that's something that they do really

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,490
well that I haven't seen as much in the

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,679
Drupal community that would be really

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,809
interesting myself well this has been an

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:57,159
ongoing conversation for years between

00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:58,929
camp partners at different times in

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,570
different levels I know it's been

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:07,960
discussed the pros and cons of

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:09,429
additional centralization of Drupal and

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,820
how much do we want the Drupal

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:20,820
Association involved with organizing the

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:22,960
Florida can so I think it's tricky Beth

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,169
but there's lots more people in the

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,860
community so if you have strong feelings

00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:32,020
or an opinion or great ideas I think the

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,029
last link up there is probably a good

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,370
place to start if you're not you know if

00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,620
you're involved rupal not organizing at

00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,860
any level or even just interested in it

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,840
on this blog channel it's actually not

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,720
part of the Drupal slack its own slack

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,059
instance it's for Drupal without

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,890
organizers there's a lot of really

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,510
interesting things happening there and a

00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:56,380
lot of opportunity to get involved and

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,909
help us kind of evolve where they are

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,370
now to where we want to see them go to

00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:01,900
that's two three four five years

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,530
I want to talk a little bit to that one

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,890
I ran two camps in Melbourne and we use

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:11,470
the DA as the sort of physical backup or

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,350
that and you're problematic for us just

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,630
because of currency depressants and time

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,030
zones to get approvals and things like

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,160
that you might find that you have a

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,140
Linux association in your country they

00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,720
in Australia at least they do a lot of

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,070
that support for other groups working at

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,130
open source technology so it might be an

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:36,040
avenue work together it's a little bit

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,750
different from states because most of

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,960
the countries or at least a lot of

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,800
countries have local associations which

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,600
are completely dependent from the DA and

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,500
on the states the DA can actually

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:54,450
support a lot of things within

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,789
but of course we handle things

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,650
not that we're different but there are

00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:06,870
different local associations and that's

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:10,830
usually all you need more lawyers from

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:13,080
the DA is trying to get out of the

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,450
business of the mystical instrument for

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,830
camps someone can correct me if I'm

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:25,260
wrong that's the idea I know that there

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:26,750
is a bunch of folks from accounts of

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,860
beliefs in the Midwest so Chicago

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,200
actually Kevin probably has another

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:36,360
waffle I can this is their fiscal entity

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:40,470
that was mid camp created that other

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:50,070
cancer taking advantage of now and how

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:52,260
many Drupal events are one of those

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,340
things where there is no like one

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,559
solution for fiscal for for a physical

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,960
entity burn event I guess the advice I

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,610
can give for anyone who is interested in

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,340
starting a new event or if you're an

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,289
existing camp organizer don't run it

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,570
through your personal account or you get

00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:12,690
or your business account

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,570
you know we use and we've been we've

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:19,250
been very lucky in Florida we have a

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:23,220
local computer user group organization

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,610
that you know we actually we donate

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,130
money to every year to help

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,670
you know run their club and in exchange

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,960
for them being are for school entity

00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:36,020
that's common eyes I know that there's a

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,370
bunch of camps the Horton logic around

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,410
the world who have created their own

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:43,070
physical entities to do the same thing I

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:51,290
think open collective might be another

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:53,600
potential so I think you know there's a

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,250
lot of options out there there is no and

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,160
this is very unlike the WordPress space

00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,929
right in the WordPress space that's not

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,419
through there's a automatically work

00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:05,299
done to the WordPress foundation however

00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:08,390
they are a lot stricter about how you

00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:10,490
can use brand marks and what you can

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,880
call a word camp and what you can't and

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,650
things like that so you would lose some

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,330
flexibility but they have very hot

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,730
because they are nonprofit

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,110
they have reporting requirements so they

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,030
take in a hundred thousand dollars from

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,559
a sponsor they have to have all these

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,900
certain metrics and things like that

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,309
that are required by law that are not

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,900
the same when you're doing it at

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,730
different scales and different countries

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,169
and things like that too and this is

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,150
something that we as a community we have

00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:38,500
to figure out we have to you know decide

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,910
are we satisfied with camp organisers

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,059
having to do all of this fiscal entity

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,950
stuff and manage all the stuff ourselves

00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:48,679
or do we want to look to the DEA to

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,179
provide some of these services but that

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,210
would be an exchange for giving up some

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,210
control

00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:02,330
Oh WordPress is once things again

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,600
it's it's you know that globally yeah me

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,600
too

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,590
I'm not sure how they do it when they

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,380
transfer money between other countries

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,630
there may be different restrictions but

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,360
they support campus globally so whatever

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:21,900
they can do to provide that physical

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,000
entity they were the funding basically

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,400
we turned in a spreadsheet for our camp

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,540
was like alright we spent $700 for the

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,340
after

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,260
here's who paid that on their credit

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,150
card and here's how to reimburse them

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,760
and they have a back-end system in the

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,380
word camps which is another interesting

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,240
feature that they offer is if you're

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,310
going to post an actual word camp an

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,470
official word camp you get the full

00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,300
infrastructure that gives you a site and

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,830
all you're responsible for is the design

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,680
they have the plugins that handle

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,820
payment and printout tickets and all of

00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,000
those things except the things already

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,700
built together which when you're running

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,380
hundreds of camps a year it helps to

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,510
have someone get paid just to make it

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,550
plug-in that does badges right because

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,550
I'm sure if you've run a camp before you

00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,110
so they do some things like that that

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,390
just take allow you to focus on the camp

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,850
part and finding speakers and doing fun

00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,010
things as a community instead of worry

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,680
about some of those logistics so there

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,750
are definitely things that could be

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:25,050
abstracted out of there that don't

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,150
necessarily have to be is there a a camp

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,860
distribution that was discussed at one

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,080
point

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,870
I don't know we actually created one for

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,390
when we did out camps and we made it

00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,070
like an unconference so at the start of

00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,440
the event everybody had some people talk

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,740
about stood up and did a lightning talk

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,450
and then everybody in the crowd voted

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,950
for what they wanted and the

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,529
distribution automatically scheduled it

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,470
based on the room sizes yeah so it's a

00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:53,240
triple seven its own eat hug

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:58,880
it'll be out if you look for reality

00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:02,570
it'll be that something so one of the

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,610
biggest things is I learned is asking

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,549
for help and the triple organizer slap

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:11,330
child is a great place to like ask for

00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:14,000
advice and ask for help and one of the

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,889
things that's also volunteers just

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,080
reaching out and actually talking to

00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:19,700
people to ask them to volunteer

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,590
there's a lot more than just saying hey

00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,340
come volunteer and come find me because

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,809
a lot of people don't necessarily feel

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,580
like they can but when you get to

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:30,110
talking to them and explain like no it's

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,269
just doing like this kind of stuff and

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,370
this one's explaining it to them kind of

00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:39,710
makes it a little bit easier for them to

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:41,510
say yes to you so on that note is there

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,279
anything else you guys have learned I

00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:50,480
want to discuss or if there are any

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:53,090
questions one piece of advice I give a

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,450
lot of camp organisers is if you're just

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,870
starting out keep it simple don't try to

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,610
keep up with a neighboring County so

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,010
have a good event you really need in my

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:07,130
opinion three things you need two people

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,580
need a venue and the presenters I'm a

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,580
safety

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,620
but don't follow the top of well such a

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,740
such a capitalized meals so we have to

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:24,370
provide meals or you know this can't

00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:28,210
provides t-shirts or this if you're just

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:30,790
starting out keep it simple clients as

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,100
well our complex complex we have needed

00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:39,220
and as you have the staff or the

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:42,250
volunteers to support it sort of if you

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,290
feel that a successful camp needs to

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,180
know some things but you don't have

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,990
people help you all those things and you

00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,990
start taking out on yourself

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:59,440
alright nervous breakdown the other

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:01,570
thing is there's some events that run

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,670
for free and I actually think that's not

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,220
always a good idea for at least a

00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,860
starting event you should be however

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,660
smaller what it is I think for our camps

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,940
we charge five dollars but it was just

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,850
something that they paid so that they

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:20,130
had incentive to actually turn up yes

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,130
and and the other thing was

00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:32,060
this time we're not so we always did

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:33,760
that but maybe this time it's going to

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,650
be a pretty

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,940
so there yeah it's there's a lot of

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,260
complexity both of that because you

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,270
really don't know how many people is

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,300
going to call and a lot of people are

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:48,580
just going to sing me then they might

00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,480
not show up yeah and how do you actually

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,070
plan the meal for that so one of the

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,800
solo solution which is of course if you

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,810
don't have the sponsor for the meal

00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,400
but then you have to be in somewhere

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:06,280
where two people come so yeah definitely

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,220
there are some complexity despite the

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,190
price of them

00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,260
I remember well it's going to say so I

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,599
mean we mentioned you but you don't

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,549
always end up burnt out as the cause

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,069
that you can't do this stuff like I've

00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:23,549
had to step back because of family you

00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:26,579
know I still I want to be involved in

00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:28,079
the community most at departments so on

00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:31,649
the topic of price

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,780
I actually I encourage organizers to

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,789
raise the price all the time and the

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,609
reason why is that along with that I

00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:41,069
also encourage organizers to basically

00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:43,679
give away tickets to people who want

00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:49,349
yeah right all presenters out decision

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,960
on the game ticket for tickets website

00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:54,869
you are in need of financial support to

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,720
attend this event and for our campus

00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,460
basically yes that's the responsible

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,470
must send the request so you're trying

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,900
to get the best of both worlds we do

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,760
charge something so you can get

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,799
reasonable numbers for things that cater

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,020
and the teacher production but you're

00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:14,250
not stopping anybody from attending yeah

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:16,349
because you are you're willing to give

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,910
away the tickets cliff and making that

00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:19,650
very clear on the website is a great way

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,619
of attracting more diverse people and

00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,450
new people so the thing is a lot is oh

00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,170
what are the

00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:30,089
what is the proportion of the revenue or

00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,230
the benefits of the count and actually

00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:33,230
called tickets

00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:48,570
and the sponsor thing or the expenses

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:51,600
that you don't have like straight

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,610
forward a friend of mine ran a more

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,100
Industry Association type of it for

00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,740
several years and they would charge a

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,630
four hundred dollars a ticket but eighty

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,630
or ninety percent of people who got in

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,400
got him for free because the companies

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,720
that sponsored it got a bra a block of

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,460
free tickets if you were a university

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,460
stick a student you got a free ticket

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,130
what he was doing was framing the value

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,900
of the event and this is a four year

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,550
dollar event and so people showed up and

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,650
they went even though they were getting

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,230
a free ticket because man I'm gonna free

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,810
ticket to this $400 men and so it shaped

00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,600
it in their mind as a very valuable a

00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,670
bit even though we've really drilled

00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,590
into it almost no they were not planning

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,690
to make money off they didn't make money

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,370
off the ticket sales in order to support

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,720
the event they used the sponsors but

00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,460
they created the value and the

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,410
perception of value of the event by

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,780
creating a price point that was very hot

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,360
well still giving away 80% I think

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,450
that's interesting it seems like a bug

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,270
be careful with that or $100,000 rupees

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:53,010
sponsorships oh yes selling so you were

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,460
actually you were actually the product

00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:00,060
if you were going for free but you

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,619
should also work out your budget so that

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,269
the cost of ticket sales

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,140
cover the cost of the conference in case

00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:09,269
you don't get sponsors like wait the

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,849
first time I ran the camp we I basically

00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:13,740
called all of the local companies and it

00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:19,019
was a bit disheartening that all the

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,720
small companies so that's the thing on

00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:26,369
Drupal events most of the time who

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,940
targeted sponsors that are companies

00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:32,849
agencies from the community not actually

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:35,809
company companies or sponsors before we

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,809
could be their target

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:45,180
wonderful

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,450
and one other thing which I did want to

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,790
mention to kind of to talk to diversity

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,710
inclusiveness at our local meetups I

00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,130
made a decision right at the start did

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,589
not have alcohol as part of the meetup

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:02,690
before I took over it was a pub meetup

00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:06,089
potentially and I knew we had people who

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,520
things like that who don't drink so it

00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:10,619
was a way to be respectful to the

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,510
speaker presenters because you know

00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,230
people are all drinking before the talk

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,730
start then it gets a lot rally ER and to

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,980
make a second space of all those people

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,000
and we just encourage at the end you

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,410
know if you want to come

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,410
fancy drinks in chapter

00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,780
so I could we have we're wrapping up a

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,830
little bit but I think we have time for

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,200
one question if there is a question

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:38,660
otherwise thank you all very much thank

00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,150
you all for coming as well and oh oh

00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,960
another important thing Thank You Leslie

00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:47,780
is the triple Association membership

00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,290
it's a small however much you can pay to

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,780
be a member

00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,950
it is the Association that kind of puts

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,869
all of these things together and

00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:57,050
connects us all and says this is it's a

00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:03,260
small token but it goes a long way

00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:05,180
it's from $15 it's a show as a comedy

00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,619
people here are current camp organizers

00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:14,960
or event organizers so what's up maybe a

00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:16,520
quarter put your hands up again so for

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:36,859
the remainder of you is it safe to

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:38,750
assume that you are aspiring okay if you

00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,940
were some other group find one of us I'm

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,500
just really curious as to because this

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,660
will help shape this conversation of

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,119
future Drupal events if we know like we

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,950
have a better idea there are a lot of

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,300
initiatives happening in a section a lot

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,119
of interesting things are happening but

00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,040
I know not all cap organizers especially

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,930
from Europe are in there so it's always

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,260
it would always be helpful to kind of

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,820
share those ideas and share what we've

00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,430
learned and the mistakes we've made so

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,070
that we don't have to keep remaking them

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,950
so I throw out there to the aspiring

00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:12,420
post in the

00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:16,590
we tried four times to start a Drupal

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,330
meetup in our area and three or four

00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,820
people would come and I knew there were

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,770
more people that did Drupal in our area

00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,750
there were entire companies there that's

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,810
all they did and no one would show up

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,420
and we had much more success with a PHP

00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,740
meetup so there's a couple Drupal people

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,090
that come there's a couple laravel

00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:38,040
people there's a couple of WordPress

00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:40,770
people and ours is a technical level we

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,770
tend to do very kiki talks and not as

00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,750
soft the WordPress meetup itself tends

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,970
to do very intro level very easy level

00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,500
talk so we have it attracted that

00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,840
technical level so sometimes you may be

00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,820
thinking oh I'll start a Drupal meetup

00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,350
and nobody comes

00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,640
maybe broaden to your base just a little

00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:00,270
bit sometimes we don't even talk about

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,490
PHP we talk about CSS you never know you

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,600
may have more success spreading it out

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,820
if you're having trouble developing

00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,770
enough of the community around something

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,350
as focused see if something along with

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,930
broader we own that we have a lot of

00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:15,270
benefit of actually going and presenting

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:18,240
at Joomla and WordPress made us having

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:21,920
like panels across positive benefits of

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,090
yours versus ours in the list

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,710
that's a good idea that's actually

00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,470
something that we will try out for the

00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:32,250
next year 2020 to collaborate more with

00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:35,610
order of open-source need ups so we work

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:38,610
mostly with Drupal 8 I would say which

00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,920
is easily being can be deployed coupled

00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:44,430
so you can partner up with the local you

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,770
community locally react community and

00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,510
just attract other people who otherwise

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,970
would never have talked with each other

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,160
and that's what Experian that we will

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,850
run to increase our reach out at the

00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,850
number

00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,640
