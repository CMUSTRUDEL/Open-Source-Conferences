The Splash Awards celebrate the best Drupal work and put the clients behind our beloved Drupal projects center-stage. The Splash Awards are being organized in countries all over the world. Initiatives to promote Drupal are vital to maintain a strong market position and the enduring success of Drupal. With the Splash Awards gaining momentum, the need for a consistent brand is essential. A small team of volunteers also involved in organizing the next International Splash Awards during DrupalCon Amsterdam aims to take the Splash Awards brand to the next level in a way that it can be used for Splash Awards organizers around the globe. This session will give you a heads up on the Splash Awards brand, its brand materials and what to consider when you organize your next Splash Awards.
