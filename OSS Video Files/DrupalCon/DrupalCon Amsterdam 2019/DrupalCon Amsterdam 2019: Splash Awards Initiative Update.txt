The Splash Awards celebrate the best Drupal work and put the clients behind our beloved Drupal projects center-stage. The Splash Awards are being organized in countries all over the world. Initiatives to promote Drupal are vital to maintain a strong market position and the enduring success of Drupal. With the Splash Awards gaining momentum, the need for a consistent brand is essential. A small team of volunteers also involved in organizing the next International Splash Awards during DrupalCon Amsterdam aims to take the Splash Awards brand to the next level in a way that it can be used for Splash Awards organizers around the globe. This session will give you a heads up on the Splash Awards brand, its brand materials and what to consider when you organize your next Splash Awards.

	00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,140
okay I'm gonna start off because I have

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:09,059
20 minutes it's a split session so

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,790
everybody can hear me all right yeah

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,799
good so I'm gonna give you a quick

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,870
heads-up on the splash awards initiative

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,369
and the stuff that we've been doing with

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,550
the splash Awards for the past year or

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,279
so me and the team behind the splash

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,840
awards we started organizing the

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,410
international special works what happens

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,199
tonight with a small group of volunteers

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,910
and we decided to take on that it's time

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,670
to take on the brand as well and we're

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,610
going to show you what we did just a

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,410
quick recap of what splice Awards is

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,420
about and special words was initially

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,440
conceived to celebrate the best Drupal

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,760
projects there are initially locally now

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,730
it's organized in 10 different countries

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,890
and also to bring on bring in the

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,340
clients into the open source community

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,590
that we are the community that they are

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,960
part of but most of the time data know

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,799
that they are so we want very much to

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,510
bring clients on stage as well and now

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,010
the special Ward's is being organized in

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,720
countries all over the world right so

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,220
ten countries in Europe but also the

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,860
international special Ward's the one in

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,189
Seattle in April and now we have another

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:24,150
one tonight that's great with over 13

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,390
countries submitting 70 cases all about

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,070
celebrating the wonderful work and we

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,740
have some wonderful cases that have come

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,740
in on the international splicer worse

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,229
tonight's that we've seen come by so

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,860
that's amazing and that's what we've set

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,860
out to do so that goal is achieved from

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:48,210
day one but there are some challenges

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,860
that we've faced over the past year most

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,590
importantly the inconsistencies in

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,909
layout and design that we had and

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,280
messaging and format for the special

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,350
awards the different ways that they were

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,360
categorized different rule sets and

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:06,329
methods for determining winners and such

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,220
which if that happens dilutes the splash

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,869
Awards in a sense and you have stronger

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,670
cases in one region then you have in

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,140
others so that that's challenges that we

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,330
face as well

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,860
that we wanted to fix when we started

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,959
organizing the International special

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:25,140
Ward's during triple Kong this week and

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,880
obviously there's different formats in

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,610
the sense that we started out with a

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,350
black tie format but you cannot maintain

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,880
that if you want to include as many

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,530
people as you can so that's another

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,280
challenge that we faced that we were

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,280
faced with so initiatives to promote

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,650
Drupal are vital to maintain a strong

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,290
market marketing position market

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,959
position for Groupon enduring success so

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,239
we need that consistent brand we need to

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,850
repeat that message right so what you

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,160
have with awards like the webby and the

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,830
Lavi is that their actual clients say

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,630
hey we're getting the submission ready

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,959
for the for the lobbies of the webby

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,820
awards which are quite famous we're not

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,050
there yet with the splash Wars obviously

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,510
but you know now that we have a

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,330
consistent message and a brand we can

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,190
start building up that image hopefully

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,110
in you know Drupal clients and

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,489
organizations using - upon not just with

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,989
us right so that's very important the

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,900
Sox lines are going to be shared so

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,400
there's stuff that I'm sharing which is

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,739
in the URLs which you can pick up

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
afterwards

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,040
so besides organizing the International

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,720
splice Awards tonight we set ourselves

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,239
some objectives in defining a consistent

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,340
and inclusive brand so we wanted to make

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,470
sure that whatever we come up with is

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,989
going to be usable in all the different

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,540
regions and countries that are willing

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:53,070
and ready to organize the splash Awards

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,140
and flexible to adapt being able for

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,420
every one of you that is willing to

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,260
organize one in your own region to add

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,780
stuff to it but the core elements of the

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,600
brand obviously are branding guidelines

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,630
colors typography photography and so

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,049
forth so that's that's something that

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,090
we've created and it's very cool that we

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,150
have that now and we also looked at the

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,359
guidelines for it for submitting splash

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,740
awards both regional and international

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,900
because there are some challenges there

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,360
so how do we go about cases that are

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,569
already submitted how do we go

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,240
cases that already won obviously share

00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,830
whatever we come up with so that's what

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
I'm doing today that's been happening

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,819
online that's on special are still org

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,879
and I'm going to show you where to find

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:45,379
that in a bit and also offering means

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:47,659
for you to contribute so obviously we

00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:49,460
had some help from the outside and we

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,860
hired a professional that helped us

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,439
create the new brand for the special

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,419
warts and she had like a questionnaire

00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,870
for us in order to brief her properly

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,729
and this is one of the questions it's

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,779
like three pages so this is just a bit

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,490
of it but she asked us what keywords we

00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,099
would use to describe the special wards

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,360
so these are the keywords that we came

00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:17,090
up with which I think resonate with most

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,219
of us when we think of the splash warts

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,129
in terms of open sores in terms of

00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:25,129
sharing inclusiveness and so forth

00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:28,340
so this is a process that we've been

00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:30,889
going through this is an example of the

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,469
style study that we went through and I'm

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,029
just showing you this to make you

00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,060
understand I let you know that we went

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:41,449
through a professional process and

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,860
wanted to be as flexible and it's

00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:48,500
inclusive as we could and also had like

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,169
a relative relatively large group of

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,169
people around the world that we tested

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,550
and send stuff over to and said hey will

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,180
this work for your region what do you

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:03,050
think about it here you see the keywords

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,300
that we offered in our briefing linking

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,300
towards different styles that we that we

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,659
studied and examined a color palette

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,189
matching the stuff that we wanted to to

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,189
resonate with this Blackmore's

00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,650
obviously the typography all laid out in

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,650
the brand book and this has become the

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,930
logo that we've been using and it's

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,599
going to be here for us for at least the

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:34,189
next five years the news flash Awards

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:36,500
logo obviously we went ahead and

00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,599
researched if this will touch any other

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,570
symbolism or cultural beliefs or

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,420
whatever

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,120
it's out there to make sure that we

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,680
don't have any conflicts or clashes and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,050
there's actually a rationale behind the

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,070
logo because there's obviously to drop

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,740
making the splash and then tying it all

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,540
together forming a crown which is also a

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,120
little homage to the previous logo that

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,940
we had but the splash words being an

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,490
award right should be like really

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,500
something with stature so that's what

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,920
we've tried to go to accomplish but also

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,160
not be too posh and too big because

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,840
that's not that's not what we are we've

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,420
tested how that works on different

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,330
visuals and put that in the brown book

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,860
say hey if you if you're using it these

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,350
are the colors and this is the way you

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,110
do it this is the overlay that you used

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,000
and as we as we love sticker so much

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,520
obviously the badges were very important

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,410
to us so we're going to have them in

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,180
stickers tonight but they're also

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,390
digitally if you enter the splash

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,850
rewards if you are a nominee or maybe a

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:45,900
winner tonight you can use these and put

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,970
in your cases online or physically these

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,660
are the certificates that we hand out to

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:54,330
all the nominees and runner-ups and

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,330
winners so we want everyone to go home

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,120
with proof of what they've accomplished

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,100
so we tried to work this out this is all

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,820
laid out in a brand book ready for you

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,060
to use

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,010
I actually have 88 of them framed in my

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,110
car driving them to the special Ward's

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,480
in an hour

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,900
obviously we worked out the visuals how

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,760
to use them these are all templated in

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,980
sketching Photoshop and whatever tools

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,810
to use and change for you and this is

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,700
something that has not been realized but

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,740
that we move very much like to order and

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,780
there was it was too short notice to

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,210
style but this is the cool stuff

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:40,290
obviously that you can make you can do

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:42,210
without so that all the way then this is

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,620
the Bluetooth logo right everybody knows

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:49,950
that so what's this logo anybody knows

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,520
that just puts a puss up Rockstar bucks

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,230
right yeah so it's very important to

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,720
you know to maintain that level of

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,260
recognition that we that we tried so

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,490
hard to establish so we've also or you

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,070
know the expert the professional that we

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,980
hired to find some stuff not to do with

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,070
the logo you know it's very tempting to

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,540
put that little flag in the middle or to

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,030
change it a little bit but it's very

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,040
important that if we want to you know we

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,590
recognize the splash awards whatever we

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,810
stick on there what we also want like

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,670
clients to recognize the splash wars and

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,400
come to your agency or come to you say

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,770
hey look should I shoot in our case be

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,480
nominated for special warts you know we

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,950
want the media to pick up on the splash

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,020
Awards and start writing about it

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,970
because we want to reach more people

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,450
about a wonderful group of work that

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:44,040
we're doing so we need to you know to

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,840
contain ourselves and try to keep with

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,000
whatever we've laid down in a brand book

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,060
obviously there's you know we're finding

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,310
ways and thinking of ways for for

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,420
expanding that and for all of you to

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,250
contribute but this goes for the logo

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,460
and colors and so forth so this is all

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,610
lay down laid out in a brand book what

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,130
to use and what not to use so that is

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,570
with regards to the brand we also talked

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,550
about the guidelines because there were

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,130
some challenges there and I've picked

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,680
two highlights in this particular case

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,330
what do we do if a special Ward's has

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,780
already won in a particular reason

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,060
region are already won in a certain

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,220
international special Wars because what

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,680
we wanted to avoid is like one big

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,630
agency come in like a multinational or a

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,930
bigger agencies also also using Drupal

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,550
and start submitting their cases to the

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,220
special words and start harvesting away

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,220
all the wins fight so if you want your

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,580
gun so that's that's one of the rules

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,110
changes that we did now obviously you

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,090
know if we find ourselves that that's

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,090
not workable we need to find you know

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,950
for a change or or fix to that but it's

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,750
something that we we've laid out any

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,310
ground rules now also we want special

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,130
warts to happen in conjunction with

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,320
Drupal con because then we can sort of

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,180
we have the broadest reach to also reach

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
out to businesspeople and clients

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,080
hey shouldn't you be submitting your

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
place to the special wars and by the way

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:17,520
there's this wonderful thing happening

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,680
so the event gets its online its own

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,740
special horse to orbit on that page all

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,450
about like organizing your on a link to

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,910
the kit it will lead you to a Google

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,770
Drive folder that has two folders in

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,510
itself one with the branding and

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,570
marketing resources all the stuff that I

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,920
just showed you and the other one and

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,950
that's still work-in-progress with

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,200
templates and organization resources

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:45,420
which has stuff like rating templates

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,480
and standard emails that you can use to

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:52,080
send out and stuff like that so that's

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,730
there if you go the slides will be

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,959
sharing and you can find the URL but if

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,360
you go to special words to work you'll

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,709
find it real quick

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,370
obviously there are still some stuff

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,959
that that we would have liked doing or

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,320
that we want to do which is on the

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,690
roadmap the website obviously there are

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,910
some some some things that we want to do

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,890
there but also we've designed a

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,130
marketing template for sending out

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,980
emails like three months prior emails

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,560
like a special Wars is coming - hey

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,089
thank you for submitting your case and

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,709
stuff like that but it needs to be

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:31,320
implemented still we started

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:36,990
distributing the event kit you know this

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,910
session is part of that also online we

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,459
want to find means for everyone to

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,470
contribute easily right now there's a

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,200
contribute folder in that Google Drive

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,150
place if you want to drop stuff or share

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,170
stuff but we need to find a way to do

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:54,420
that consistently obviously it wouldn't

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,610
make much sense for well you know people

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,610
like myself or other people involved in

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,800
marketing to put all the stuff in a coke

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,899
repository I'm not sure if that's the

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,579
most efficient way but again we're

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:10,290
looking for ways for everyone to

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:13,980
contribute and this is an important one

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,870
we're actually looking for ways to save

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,610
harbor the special words in a way that

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,410
the brand is protected but also that

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,819
there's going to be an

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,949
special warts so we're talking to the

00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:25,430
Drupal Association about that see if

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:27,529
they're willing to somehow contain that

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,810
special words and make sure that there's

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,639
one happening in Minneapolis and should

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,660
make sure that they support whatever

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,689
other regions are willing to invest in

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:42,529
the special words but anyway that's

00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:47,180
that's stuff going on right now and then

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:48,829
finally we did a cool - for everybody to

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,360
support the initiative especially local

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,879
associations there's four associations

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,279
involved and setting up what I've just

00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,899
shown you which is - the two German

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,670
associations the Belgian have been

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,170
finished association and the Dutch

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,600
Association and the old front at 5:00 on

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,600
maduro's we went just a little bit over

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,120
that but obviously there's some there's

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,910
more stuff that we won't want to do so

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,550
for us it's money well spent because it

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,740
helps promote rupal in our region right

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,040
so if you're you are part of an

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,899
association and or if you are willing to

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,860
tie our name to the splash wort or help

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:34,100
it further there's ways to do that so

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:37,029
and that is the update for now any

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,029
questions at this point

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,380
No okay so we'll be here a week while

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,110
