Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019:Fast UX Feedback for Your Drupal Project
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Performer:  Suzanne Dergacheva
Description: This is an interactive session in which we run a series of 3 very short demos of Drupal projects, and the audience provides structured UX feedback.

In the demos, presenters show us a 3-minute version of their prototype or working interface. The audience gives feedback structured into three rounds: first impressions, positive feedback, and constructive feedback.

For the last two years, I've helped organize a series of UX feedback events in Montreal, Ottawa, and various Drupal events that follows the same format. The structure allows us to fit in a lot of content in a short time, and gets everyone participating and practicing their UX skills.

I'm saying this is a UX feedback session

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,540
that we're doing today my name is

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,480
Suzanne Decker Java and I work at

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,950
evolving web butterfly agency in

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,120
Montreal I do a lot of drupal trainings

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm on the board of the Drupal

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,289
Association and in general I love doing

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,390
drupal been doing it for many years and

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,789
I also just mention I work with a really

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,090
fun team in Montreal so if anyone wants

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:36,300
to move to Canada yes we are hiring so

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,700
for the last few days I've been hanging

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,340
out in the Netherlands I've done a lot

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,829
of cycling here for those of you who

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,930
live here you know I'm very impressed

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,420
with your cycling infrastructure I have

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,430
a few UX related observations first of

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,039
all I love the signage for cyclists I

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,230
love those little triangles that tell

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,750
you who is supposed to yield to you I've

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,449
never seen this before it's a great

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,500
experience I clean around I love the

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,170
little baskets for for your litter in

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,479
your trash so it really game of flies

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,350
picking up garbage I think this is a

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,810
great user experience on the negative

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,000
side I'm not still not sure what to do

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,700
when I bike up to one of these buttons

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,860
and I don't know if every time I hit it

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,049
like I feel like I keep hitting it and

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,430
nothing happens so someone's gonna have

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:37,530
to explain this to me but overall great

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:40,290
UX experience so far recently I've been

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,950
doing a lot of UX work running UX

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,979
workshops with clients doing research

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,799
and even doing a bit of contribution in

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,229
the Drupal community doing some user

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,509
studies on how people use different

00:01:52,229 --> 00:02:00,180
parts of the Drupal admin UI which has

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:03,180
been really fun and I find that a lot of

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,030
times on projects there is no person in

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,670
charge of UX so even though UX has

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,890
become more and more important over the

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,020
years I think we see it more and more as

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,860
a requirement for projects it's still

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,150
something that's now

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,720
always the biggest priority and I think

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,490
sometimes it's hard for developers you

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,860
know for the ones doing the build if

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,020
we're the ones working on the project or

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,150
for the UI designers and we've put

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,400
already energy into a project sometimes

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,480
it's hard to listen to UX feedback and

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,370
so we don't ask

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,470
so sometimes it's because we don't have

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,710
time or sometimes it's because we don't

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,000
have you know a budget for that but

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,370
sometimes I think those are just excuses

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,400
and we just don't want to ask for the

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,350
feedback and I think that part of the

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,020
problem too is that when we ask for

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,570
feedback sometimes all we get is this

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,930
like long list of things to do and it's

00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:01,050
it's not always the most constructive or

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,160
useful so what I'm going to talk to you

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,990
about today is actually a technique for

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,959
asking for feedback and giving feedback

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,100
and I'm just going to talk about it for

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,630
a short time and then we're actually

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,880
going to practice it and we're gonna

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:21,390
give you X feedback on a couple of

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:23,310
projects a couple of interfaces so this

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,830
technique that I'm talking about it's

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,280
very simple whether you're a designer

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,600
developer project manager or end user

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,700
whether that you're the one giving

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,370
feedback or the one receiving the

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,200
feedback you can use this so you can

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,720
actually use this technique in client

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,489
reviews or internal demos we actually

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,890
use it as part of a regular meet up that

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,380
we run where anybody can come and

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,250
present an interface and get feedback on

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,959
whatever they're working on so if you

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,400
are interested in running similar

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,880
meetups I would love to talk to you

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,060
about it and share my experiences so

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,540
these are just some photos of the

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,930
meetups so it all starts with a demo or

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,470
a walkthrough that's kind of step step

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,750
zero in the process the purpose of the

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,820
demo when you're asking for feedback is

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,919
to show so if you're if you're trying to

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,930
solicit feedback from someone I see a

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,549
lot of demos where there's a lot of

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,650
talking and explaining going on

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,750
and when you're asking for feedback it's

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,300
better to show what you're working on

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,479
and not taking time to explain or kind

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,340
of defend and a lot of times when your

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,630
developer presenting something you've

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,590
worked on you've already put a lot of

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,539
time into it so the the instinct is to

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,340
say oh yeah but it's not quite finished

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,250
yet or yeah like it's supposed to work

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,169
like this it's better just at the scene

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,870
by talking about maybe what the user is

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,750
trying to achieve with your interface to

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,580
give that context but long explanations

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,560
and narratives tend to kind of bias the

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,780
type of feedback you get then after the

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,509
demo when people are actually giving the

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,590
feedback I find it really useful to give

00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:12,909
this feedback in three rounds so step

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:15,310
two is after the demo the feedback

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:18,220
givers the audience today that's going

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,860
to be all of you you start with a round

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,810
of descriptive keywords and this is the

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,000
part that people usually leave out this

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,440
is really key to set the scene so when

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,150
you're when you first see an interface

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,949
you know you're you're brand new you're

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,199
having an experience for the first time

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,020
before you start getting positive

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,150
feedback or negative feedback before you

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,330
start using a lot of adjectives to

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,580
describe what you see

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,509
it's really useful to take this time to

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,909
just give a neutral kind of description

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,570
a few words that describe what you've

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:55,240
seen and the purpose is that it helps us

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,719
as the audience kind of understand what

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,909
we've seen without jumping into those

00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:03,430
positives and negatives and really set

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:05,500
the scenes at the context it helps us

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,580
put ourselves into the shoes of the user

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,560
so think about that so if you're if

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,210
you're working on a project you know

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,250
your developers the developers

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,380
presenting something you're trying to

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,750
give feedback think first about like

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,659
what what is this interface for let's

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:27,520
just let's try and describe it before we

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:29,110
start criticizing or praising so the

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,729
next phase is the easy one positive

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,320
feedback it's fun to give positive

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,839
feedback this seems like kind of an

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,169
obvious one but the truth is that it's

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,909
real

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,529
important to take time to give positive

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:42,430
feedback first as soon as you've given a

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:46,150
significant amount of positive feedback

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,849
you feel much more comfortable giving

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,039
the critical feedback and the negative

00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:54,939
feedback the more useful kind of

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,400
questioning and poking at things so

00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:00,340
positive feedback first is super

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,159
important it's also good to get those

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,930
thoughts flowing about an interface so

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,050
taking that time to give positive

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,759
feedback getting more enthusiasm and

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,580
then of course whoever is presenting

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,110
this interface needs to hear that

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,389
positive feedback too because they put a

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,509
lot of work in they need they need that

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,629
positive reinforcement to keep their

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,400
energy going and then the last step this

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,259
is the really valuable stuff the

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,779
critical feedback so critical feedback

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,580
can take many forms so it's not just

00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,839
saying I don't like this this doesn't

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,539
work this sucks

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,550
we don't we don't have to just save

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,949
critical feedback in this way a lot of

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,520
critical feedback can be pulling in

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,860
examples from other interfaces we can

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,930
ask questions so one of the best forms

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,699
of critical feedback is somebody demos a

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,219
product or an interface to you and you

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,529
ask them questions like oh is it

00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,189
supposed to do this or does it work like

00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,860
that

00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:59,469
or did you did you think about adding

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,439
this feature asking those questions can

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:06,819
be the most useful thing and unlike user

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:08,259
testing where all the feedback you're

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,939
collecting it sort of feels more

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,419
scientific with user testing you know

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:15,819
you're testing with actual real users in

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,680
a in a feedback session like this where

00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:21,580
you're getting feedback maybe from your

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,129
peers your colleagues or just random

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,770
people that gathered in a room to see an

00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,259
interface the people giving the feedback

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,210
aren't necessarily your users and they

00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,250
haven't used the interface necessarily

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,409
themselves they're watching a demo so

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,240
all the critical feedback you take if

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,310
you're if you're the one collecting the

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,130
feedback you have to take it all with a

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,890
big grain of salt and put it through the

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,930
filter of does this actually is are

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,910
these criticisms or these suggestions

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,420
actually gonna help my

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,370
users and so the most important thing

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,240
for the feedback take her to do is to

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,980
actually take notes and listen so that's

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,560
this is the hardest part so if you're

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,240
implementing this kind of feedback

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,520
technique and you're asking for feedback

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,770
in this way a lot of times when you're

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,420
doing this demo it becomes a

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,550
conversation where you ask for feedback

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,980
people say oh I don't like this you

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,280
should change that color this is not

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,590
accessible and it becomes a debate or an

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,420
argument or a conversation and it's much

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,150
more useful to just listen to all the

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,160
feedback record it all and then go

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,820
through it in a rational way and kind of

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,040
see does this make sense for my product

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,540
does this make sense for my users what

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:41,740
is the most important feedback to

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:45,520
implement okay so demo times I promised

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:49,540
a UX feedback session so we're gonna do

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:53,110
two demos I'm gonna start with one where

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,620
I'm actually gonna do a demo of an

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,640
interface that you might have seen

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:03,760
before you might have some feedback on

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,770
and then sasha is going to come up and

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,970
do a second demo so we have I hope time

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:14,710
for two demos today and then if you want

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,390
you can give feedback on this feedback

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,390
session which is going to be super meta

00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,940
okay

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,660
so usually I get other people up here to

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,490
do the demos but I had a lack of

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,560
volunteers today so I'm doing this demo

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:38,650
myself okay so probably most of you have

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,590
been to drupal.org but I'm guessing that

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,840
a lot of you have never been to the

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:49,270
community section community section is a

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:54,370
relatively new section of drupal.org and

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:57,580
its audience is new users people who are

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,830
maybe new to the community they're new

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,150
to Drupal and maybe they're looking for

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,410
help or support and they've heard that

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,149
Drupal like you come

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,569
for the codes de for the community so

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,399
there have come to this page and maybe

00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:14,139
I'm someone in the community and I'm

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:17,230
looking for I'm looking for help with a

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,399
problem like I've started to install and

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,620
use Drupal but I'm having trouble

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,360
learning it on my own and I'm trying to

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,889
get over that famous Drupal learning

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:32,110
curve so I come here I see there's

00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:33,519
community groups I look around

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:40,689
trying to figure out some of the

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:47,860
terminology maybe I think oh yeah like

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:50,319
an event could be useful nonprofit

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,329
drupal maybe my website is for a

00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:57,100
nonprofit organization so maybe I'm

00:11:52,329 --> 00:12:03,750
gonna start looking at that link I open

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:09,310
it up it kind of takes me to this other

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:14,110
section so I keep scrolling down the

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:17,949
page I want help installing Drupal

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,240
there's a lot of links here I want to

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,250
connect with members of the Drupal

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,769
community that seems kind of relevant to

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,870
what I want to do and I keep scrolling

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:33,250
down and can't find what you're looking

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:35,380
for maybe that's me it's more links so I

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,050
see some recent posts so maybe that's

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,910
gonna be interesting to help me kind of

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,300
get some context for what this is for

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,439
and then there's other other blogs and

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,740
things so maybe I'll open up the

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:53,589
community blog and start to read read

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:56,559
through that okay so I'm looking for

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,829
more information about some specific way

00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:03,009
to get involved and I think the most

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:05,370
relevant thing is probably this section

00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,370
here

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,880
I want to connect with members of the

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Drupal community so I start to dig into

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:27,950
these links so that's so that's the demo

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,740
so then it's useful when you're doing a

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,590
demo to actually ask for the specific

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,750
feedback that you want maybe like what

00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,770
aspects of this interface could use the

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,720
most input so I think there's clearly

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,670
like a lot of links here so I want

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,470
feedback on what content do you think

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,720
would be most useful to the users of

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:57,230
this page and how like how that content

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:59,660
could be maybe better prioritized but

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,510
any any input on how this could be

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,900
better or what could be valuable here

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,090
would be useful okay so I've got these

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,190
two boxes which are apparently

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,080
microphones so if you're lucky enough to

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,810
be down on the ground floor

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,580
you can grab a microphone and the first

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,990
round of feedback that we're gonna give

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:24,680
on this community page is about just

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:30,740
what you saw so neutral words to

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:33,160
describe what I've just demoed so who

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,160
wants to start

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:46,569
can I speak to this ok so I saw a list

00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:48,970
of various groups of people like kind of

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:54,369
an how the community is organized in

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:58,959
different ways and I also saw some like

00:14:54,369 --> 00:15:02,410
Q&A type of details elements or

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:05,949
accordion to answer like probably most

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:08,410
common questions of like for people who

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:11,579
are looking for ways to contribute or

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,579
participate in the community

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:22,529
ok great who else you did too good a job

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:45,329
heard of LA he said I saw a lot of links

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:45,329
and a lot of text anyone else yes

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:58,860
I think I saw you are unsure what you're

00:15:51,420 --> 00:16:00,899
looking for anything else keywords you

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:10,230
would use to describe this page if yes

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:12,089
over there okay if you're not familiar

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,949
that's hard to understand what it means

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,220
so that's starting to get into negative

00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:19,050
feedback so once you hear some negative

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,269
feedback you know it's a sign that maybe

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,449
maybe it's been well described so we saw

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:26,550
we heard you know in terms of the first

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,639
round of feedback there's a lot of links

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:33,120
a lot of information it's something for

00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,819
the community okay so let's move on

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,079
actually to the positive feedback so

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:41,670
what do we like about this page what are

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,620
positive things what are things that you

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:51,750
think this does what this interfaced as

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:53,610
well hi I like that you were talking to

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,170
the user like find your place you know

00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:02,300
so the language it took was direct to

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:05,280
them other positive feedback hands up

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,169
yes so I like the fact that there was

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,970
kind of call to action if you didn't

00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:10,260
find out what you wanted so there was a

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,339
way to provide feedback and ask

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,339
questions in the end

00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,950
like that I think I saw the the sections

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,960
that describes like what I'm looking for

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,760
in a certain situation so I think it's

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,660
helpful that I kind of read the context

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,480
where I'm I'm in myself so yeah like I

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,900
want to help get help installing Drupal

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,420
I want to contribute so it's it's kind

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,360
of directly speaks to myself okay so

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,980
from the first person that's great okay

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,780
we need a couple more positive feedback

00:17:50,980 --> 00:18:00,700
who else hasn't spoken yet they're in

00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:04,480
the green it doesn't get very technical

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,130
when you get on the website it is solely

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,610
for developers it's also for other

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,680
people so if you go a little bit up

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,930
you'll see other communities you can

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:25,260
participate in it's not only for

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:25,260
developers yes in the front row yes

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:45,410
and I like that you could flip open and

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,750
close the boxes so we don't go to

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:51,130
another page and then I'm and to another

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,130
page so you stay on the same page

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,140
anything else

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:08,510
hands way I can't see super well put

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:11,060
your hands way up yes over here from a

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,130
Content standpoint I like that when you

00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,020
click on community in the navigation you

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,690
come to the page and it states right at

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,720
the top what the philosophy is of the

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,160
community and then quickly you see the

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,390
different community groups and if

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,640
they're not if there's not something

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,960
there that you want you can go to groups

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,950
Drupal org

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,470
so I think as a user from the navigation

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,160
standpoint this is delivering on what I

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,910
would expect to see from the navigation

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,920
okay great

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,630
so I can tell everyone's bursting with

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,900
critical feedback that they want to

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:47,920
unleash so that's the whole point so now

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,840
we can open it up to questions

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,410
suggestions critical feedback things

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,600
that you wish could be better and I'm

00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:03,740
gonna take notes and watch the recording

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:06,260
later yes okay sorry for my English

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:12,950
can you please scroll down to find your

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:17,060
place okay so I'd like if you open one

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:21,340
group open please yes and open another

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:25,340
group so I'd like if you open one the

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:31,720
because the which is opened before which

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,720
was opened before right George

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:39,760
it'd be cool if it had a like a

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,410
contextual search at the top I want to

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,660
thought that thought you type it in and

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,580
it would just bring it to where it was

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,800
plus there's a reference to groups that

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,250
drupal.org and I'm not exactly sure how

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,910
current that is if anyone still uses

00:20:51,250 --> 00:21:00,690
that or not it's very positive negative

00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,690
feedback Jorge anyone else yes Lauri

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,770
just kind of thinking of myself when I

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,480
started contributing to something and if

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,030
I would have seen this as the first

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,980
thing I don't I don't really know if it

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,380
would have helped me in any way to

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,630
participate because of like I don't

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,100
think any of these things really was

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,340
what I wanted to do I kind of just

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,480
wanted to go to an event and like learn

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,670
about Drupal more like I would feel that

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,440
there's a lot of information being given

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,080
to me that I don't know what it means

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,880
like for example the first group that

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,100
Isis community working group it's like

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,860
what is that is that something I have to

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,240
know about and if I'm really new to the

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,220
community maybe it's not really

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,040
something you have to understand at that

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,910
point that's the first thing so I feel

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,550
like that there's probably like I feel

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,920
like this is structured in a way which

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,750
is like the way to people who are very

00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,580
familiar with the community would think

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,010
about this rather than from the point of

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,440
view of someone who's really new to the

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,870
community and just have to learn the

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,300
very basics at first so I think there's

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,400
a lot of great information here but I

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,770
think just the audience is probably a

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:22,300
little bit different than what we are

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:25,900
targeting here I would say if the user

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,370
isn't a technical person they could use

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,100
something that was maybe used on

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,840
commercial sites like for feedback like

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,760
some sort of dialog box like a chat box

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,900
where you can leave a question if you

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,460
don't find what you're looking for on

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,110
that page you know just give her your

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,780
email address in a question and somebody

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,180
could get back to you later on there's

00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,010
no interaction with

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,890
the person come into the page now they

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,630
meet you anyway hmm I mean similar your

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,070
search thing like you know what you're

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:56,640
doing on the page like search for

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:58,500
science as I believe well there's a lot

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,390
of text on there but the problem is that

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,280
I can't build mental model how it's

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,170
actually organized so there's a

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,650
community behind Drupal and I'm new to

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,680
that I don't even know that so I need to

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,830
have like an image or something how to

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:17,880
to visualize what actually happens here

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:24,420
so that would be this one would be next

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:26,670
the next page for me as a new one I do

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,590
like the text itself I do like the

00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,960
content which is on there which makes a

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,940
lot of sense for given that your Drupal

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,100
person already you see that it's up to

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,020
date you see that there is like slack

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,760
mentioned and so forth you have the

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,470
Stack Exchange things everything is fine

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,390
but for somebody who's coming new to

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,400
this and one who wants to get in evolve

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,020
in both with the community it would

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,990
probably make more sense to have like

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,700
the next most recent event that is

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,610
coming up like a Drupal con like a camp

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,320
like something close to you or what's

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,880
what's like the fastest way to get in

00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,790
contact and that would be something like

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,030
a chat to open up diary directly and

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:05,880
just stop like force people into some

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:09,050
sign up ways or force them to figure out

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:15,290
where they have to go for themselves

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:18,710
great okay one more feedback right there

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,710
just behind you

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,030
yeah oh there's a lot of text on the

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,620
page which is it's like okay cuz that's

00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,270
what it's meant to do but I think the

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,980
line length is quite long like I found

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,270
my eyes was exactly quite a lot to read

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,700
it because it was taking up the full

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,780
wait for the page so max wait for like

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,490
the paragraph or something would make

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,260
the line length not comfortable and

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,460
maybe encourage people to actually read

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,720
everything on there rather than get

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,460
tired okay amazing thank you for all the

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,730
feedback that's super useful

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,200
I'll give yourselves a round of applause

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,370
you just did some great consulting work

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:01,690
there for the Drupal Association maybe

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:04,200
okay so we're gonna do second demo I

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:10,420
want to come up here Sascha

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:14,670
so next demo Sasha's going to show us

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,670
some work that he's been doing

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,250
yes so I wanted to share with you some

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:30,210
of the work with it

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:33,830
on the admin UI so basically beyond

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:37,080
Claro we are also working on new stuff

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,090
my name is Sascha hamburger I work on

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,080
the Drupal admin UI and JavaScript

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:45,630
modernization initiative and in the past

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,530
couple of weeks I started to basically

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:53,280
on wireframes or well they're more than

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:55,470
wireframes now but just like what will

00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,400
be next for the admin UI beyond claro

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,960
basically so there's a big warning on

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,600
that so the screens I will show you now

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:12,419
basically just a handful of people have

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:14,370
seen them so not a lot part of the

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,580
community has seen this so basically I

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:21,330
think it's less than five people so this

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:24,270
is really really highly working progress

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:28,260
so basically these are things we came

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,179
along when we designed Claro things we

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,260
had in mind or things we want to change

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:36,480
for the future and I quickly want to

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,970
show you one of the screens and give

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,220
like or getting like feedback a first

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:48,450
feedback on what you think about it so

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,419
just to give you like a quick intro why

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,580
I want to show you this so basically

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,429
this is how the layout currently looks

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,100
like so this is a stripped down or like

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,130
a wireframe of Claro we have all the

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,340
regions as you know them so we have like

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:09,260
the settings and the note form and we

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:12,080
have a toolbar and everything here but

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:15,120
when we design Claro

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,570
basically we restricted ourselves to

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,210
taking seven and make it more like more

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,390
like a free fresh with the newly crafted

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,090
design system but we want stop there so

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,100
basically we want to do a lot of more

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,370
changes in the future and for that we

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:36,059
need to change the layout a bit so

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:44,340
basically this is where this comes in

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:46,769
so we have or potentially could have and

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,720
use a new tool bar and the tuba lives on

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:53,460
the left side on the screen or on the

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,289
right side if you're an RTL user so this

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,210
would be the tool bar on the left and

00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:00,299
then we have a new cipher region because

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,000
there isn't any cyber region now so we

00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:05,429
would have to create that this would be

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,429
for settings but currently we only have

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:11,039
like this settings side or but it's not

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,870
a real one in the node edit form but

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,870
this could also be potentially be used

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:20,070
in other regions throughout the UI

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:25,080
in general so this would be the cyber on

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:29,309
the right and one thing Christina and I

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,929
came around quite a lot is and like one

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,559
of the things I struggle the most with

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,960
in Drupal is the Save button in the note

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,490
edit form so basically if you use the

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,769
know that a form with paragraphs and you

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:45,389
have them all expanded you always have

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:47,549
to scroll a lot or like a very long time

00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:49,169
until you reach the Save button and you

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:51,980
can save your change but maybe your

00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:56,279
changes at you know like the first two

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,409
content pieces so this would be like a

00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,230
proposal to have like a sticky bar where

00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:03,690
you could have like a basically like a

00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:08,220
call to action which could also be

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:10,049
always in the context of your UI you're

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,850
looking at so in this example like a

00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:17,909
safe button so you always have it on

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:21,149
hand to do your action and I just did

00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:23,549
quickly basically like adapting the

00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:27,029
design system we crafted into the

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,889
wireframes you you saw so this was done

00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:31,110
like in the last couple of days just to

00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:34,980
show you basically how this potentially

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:37,309
could look like and I'm really looking

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,399
forward to your feedback as I said so

00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:44,429
almost nobody saw this yet so it's it's

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:47,129
really like you're the first one who see

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,990
this and I think we also have a lot of

00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:52,350
things in mind which is

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:57,059
showcased yet on this particular design

00:29:52,350 --> 00:30:00,090
and also there is a lot of work to be

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:03,299
done yeah I'm just looking forward for

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,700
your feedback and the the second part of

00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,340
the feedback which would be really

00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,279
valuable for us would also be what are

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,409
the most pain points for you in the

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,320
current UI so basically that we can

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:18,240
gather all the feedback of what's your

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,270
pain point with the current UI that we

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:33,870
can basically improve these parts as

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:35,730
well for the next generation you okay so

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,210
Sasha's gonna stay here while we give

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,669
feedback

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,940
I guess the cubes are still out there so

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:53,210
the first thing we need is a summary of

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:53,210
what we just saw we're having cubes

00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:02,640
so yeah we saw a general admin UI that's

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:07,169
pretty recognizable these days oh sorry

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:13,620
is it here so you have the standard

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:15,330
sidebar that you see a lot general

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,919
descriptions I'm trying to think of

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,299
there were some more hands down here we

00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:28,650
want to toss the ball down

00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:34,710
I saw a transformation from a wireframe

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:36,990
to a change depicted in that actual edit

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,600
screen of moving the Save button from

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:44,809
the far right corner to closer to the

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:52,980
Edit space it's very precise

00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:56,580
Ysabel for me it looks familiar

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,460
like if you already use it the robot you

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,900
will not get lost but they change that I

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,289
say is like thank you like we miss it

00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,150
that point maybe there aren't I mean

00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:11,120
it's not a big change but they are very

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:15,659
useful I think

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:20,220
okay any other descriptors yes I I see

00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:24,960
clearly admin toolbar

00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:28,380
first edit section and Simon re-edit

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,520
section and a call to action second call

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,650
to action yeah I could also see that

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,340
their tool bar on the left side is

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:41,160
expandable and collapsible and there's a

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,370
more action select link on the right

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:49,140
side of right top right side of the page

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:53,430
and there's presumably more link next to

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,170
that okay let's go to some positive

00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:59,730
feedback what do you like about what you

00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:12,720
see I want some new new people who

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:14,460
hasn't said anything yet just stick to

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,420
the positive for now you can come back

00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:24,780
to the negative later I just suggest not

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:31,920
negative okay so I really like the

00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:38,610
position of save button because it it is

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:42,600
now but you're out there right there

00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:50,460
behind unison it's a clean design and

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:53,130
more modern you have a very clear

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,920
separation of concerns so it's very

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:58,020
clear what part is for actions what part

00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,210
is content editing what part is saving

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,120
so I like that it's very structured and

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:13,649
very clear that's separation of how to

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:16,889
use it over here in the blue oh you got

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:23,070
a nice reorganization of elements that

00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:26,100
are needed and bringing out of elements

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,710
you know bringing them up out of the

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,600
depths so to speak notice the save

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:34,410
button and the preview button and

00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:38,160
published is a nice reorganization

00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:45,360
without completely estranging what came

00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:47,310
before Antonella oh you are okay who

00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,130
else has got positive feedback Oh way

00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,310
back there someone you can throw that

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,310
far

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,040
and I just wanted to say I really like

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,470
it I think it's a really customer-facing

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,390
you should be fear as well and we can

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,220
see I mean the examples are sure to show

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,619
this is something that I can imagine

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,030
that some of the auditors really

00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:22,390
struggling that's just a really positive

00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:26,970
thing so okay we're ready

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:32,770
Sonne more critical feedback suggestions

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:34,450
okay okay okay you could do your surgery

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,070
you can it was mid throw so I think

00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:45,040
Laurie can give us positive feedback

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:47,050
first sorry so something I like is that

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,240
the layers are very clearly visible

00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:53,020
which also helps separate the different

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,150
groups of things so for example the

00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,530
content on the left is one one layer and

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:06,250
we could have additional layers on that

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:08,020
region as well there okay kick after the

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:17,920
criticisms and the suggestions you want

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:24,609
to hear them actually I'm really hate

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:29,609
the sidebar with settings it's really

00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:35,140
too difficult to me to find sound fuels

00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:40,119
and actually in shock when they appear

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:43,980
in me a text with 1 million buttons so

00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:49,839
my suggest is to put search button

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:55,960
search field like we have on a filter

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:59,980
field like we have on modules or user

00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:03,040
permissions so you need to help - it

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,800
will help to find information fuels we

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,440
really need okay a filter for finding

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,060
the fields okay great

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,060
in the red back there

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:23,330
okay so this all looks great but when

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,810
one of the first things is like I think

00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:31,820
it's not too brave maybe because it all

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:37,190
looks familiar but as one guy the

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:41,270
settings sidebar I don't think we are

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:45,380
using it every time we edit a node so

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:48,830
maybe it could be like collapsible with

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,910
some button on the top bar and the top

00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,210
bar looks great it would be great if we

00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:59,120
could add some field over there like in

00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:03,410
content moderation we have some states

00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:06,140
of the node published so if we would

00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:11,410
have that possibility to add some fields

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:13,510
there it was great yeah thank you okay

00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,470
people next to you

00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,270
somebody somebody who hasn't said

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:22,010
something yet I've said something

00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:24,140
positive something negative not

00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,390
necessarily negative but it's it's a lot

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,000
like WordPress so what we've been saying

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,310
some people it's it's it's very familiar

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,290
which is not a bad thing but WordPress

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,000
is very simple and Drupal backend is

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,510
very complex so what I'm not seeing in

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,480
here is the central bit with the content

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:44,000
this is very simple but I have maybe in

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,460
my career of 13 years maybe seen for

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,370
sites that are this simple so the center

00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,350
part I'm not seeing a way to group

00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,570
content or to handle different kinds of

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,610
fields it's just one content field but

00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,010
that never happens with the central part

00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,750
of a Drupal site so and that's why I

00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,910
think that's the most important part you

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,970
need to focus on and filtering is one

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:07,010
way to solve it but the middle part is

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,080
more most complex part of it and that

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:15,970
gets the least attention in this

00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:19,190
wireframe okay a couple more people I

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:21,440
wouldn't put a view and a preview option

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,320
on the same page they seem kinda

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,490
redundant I really think that delete

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,339
should be a button

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:33,910
not a tap and that somehow renders the

00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:33,910
whole power optionality

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:44,030
okay and I think we have time for very

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:48,800
two very quick comments to me it's not

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:50,630
clear if you change the published field

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,440
whether it's happen immediately all you

00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:57,109
need to save after good I think the

00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,810
grouping in that top bar obviously save

00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:01,690
and preview will happen immediately

00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:16,099
so you think publish would as well but

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:20,410
anyway and in red I don't I think too

00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,410
similar I would do something more unique

00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:29,660
I also I found it a bit strange because

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,359
I don't know I think it's a bit weird

00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:38,210
save and then you put that data so I

00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:40,520
think I would put it after the okay

00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,910
thanks everyone for your feedback that

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,910
was great

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,500
and I see a team of people here have

00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:54,349
been contributing to this so I'm sure

00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:57,589
your feedback was very helpful and yes

00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:59,960
if you want to contribute more people

00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:02,330
should come right yes just a side note

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,260
so this was just one screen we have more

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,290
to share

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:11,630

coming today I hope this was helpful I

00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,030
hope you can take this and go implement

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,980
something similar in your own UX

00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,470
processes and if you want to talk more

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,960
about UX with me and get ideas for your

00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:28,240
for your starting a meet-up like this

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,240
come talk to me I'd love to chat

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:36,740
[Applause]
