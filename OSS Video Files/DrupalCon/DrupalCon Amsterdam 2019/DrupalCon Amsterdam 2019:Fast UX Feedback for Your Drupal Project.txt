Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019:Fast UX Feedback for Your Drupal Project
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Performer:  Suzanne Dergacheva
Description: This is an interactive session in which we run a series of 3 very short demos of Drupal projects, and the audience provides structured UX feedback.

In the demos, presenters show us a 3-minute version of their prototype or working interface. The audience gives feedback structured into three rounds: first impressions, positive feedback, and constructive feedback.

For the last two years, I've helped organize a series of UX feedback events in Montreal, Ottawa, and various Drupal events that follows the same format. The structure allows us to fit in a lot of content in a short time, and gets everyone participating and practicing their UX skills.
