that you come for the code and you stay

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,200
for the community that's certainly been

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,290
my experience I'm really excited about

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,900
the fact that here today we have 10

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,670
really awesome people who are all again

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,510
helping Drupal get better in different

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,700
ways I hope this is a new tradition that

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,380
to help lead future Drupal Commons where

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,290
we hear again from the community leaders

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,780
so please join me in welcoming to the

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,910
stage are our 10 community leaders

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,090
starting with tera king my friend and

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,090
colleague

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:36,900
I am Terra as you said I work at

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,120
Pantheon in our developer relations

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,650
department you probably know where you

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,850
from the Internet of sparkling robots on

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,980
drupal.org or Twitter

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,230
I live in Albuquerque New Mexico in the

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,050
US but today I'm here to talk to his

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,550
leader of Drupal diversity and inclusion

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,660
Drupal diversity and inclusion was

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,250
founded in 2016 by Niki Stevens this is

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,380
an entirely volunteer working group as

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,290
everyone is in Drupal in some ways and

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,300
we are here to continue the conversation

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,980
about diversity equity and inclusion in

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,420
the Drupal community as well as to

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,670
provide a safe space to have that

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,020
conversation and also to support our

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,910
underrepresented and marginally

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,730
marginalized colleagues in Drupal and in

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,160
tech generally in 2019 we're working on

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,380
speaker diversity we know that having

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,570
more diverse voices on stage is gonna

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,770
have a ripple effect into the audience

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,630
we're gonna more diverse voices they're

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,540
more diverse talks and overall a

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,610
healthier and stronger Drupal community

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,220
so to that end we started wondering what

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,350
what can we do to help with this problem

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,930
we hear a lot from camp organizers camp

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,340
organizers want to help as well but it's

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,500
hard to recruit when your network

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,700
doesn't look the diverse it's hard to

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,530
recruit when your organizing team isn't

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,910
diverse and you know it's a volunteer

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,770
organization there's limited time and

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,200
resources so that's one side of the

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,850
puzzle on the other side for the

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,440
speakers well I mean we all know it can

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,419
be very intimidating to get up in front

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,490
of a group and speak but when you're

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,680
marginalized in a community that feeling

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,240
is really amplified it increases the

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,340
self-doubt it increases this imposter

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,330
syndrome and it can be really hard to

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,300
speak in an event where you're not

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,720
totally sure that you're welcome

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,280
additionally for underrepresented

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,220
speakers there's often barriers like

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,290
time money family care all kinds of

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,360
issues like that so how can we bring

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,980
these groups together Marc Drummond

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,990
who's from Drupal diversity on the far

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,600
side and Jill binder is from the

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,310
WordPress community they met in 2018

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,169
true Brooklyn Nashville

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,550
Jill had been doing speaker workshops in

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,680
the WordPress community designed to

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,180
improve speaker diversity and wanted to

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,480
share her knowledge with the Drupal

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,419
community so we talked and it turns out

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,130
her workshops really work in 2018 she

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,229
gave them in 12 different cities in six

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,190
countries those communities went from

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,080
10% or

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,690
you were underrepresented speakers to

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,760
50% or more it was a huge impact in a

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,200
very short time very lightweight so we

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,220
knew we wanted to bring this to Drupal

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,080
but we needed funding so we talked to

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,820
Pantheon who provided half of the

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,770
funding as a match which meant we needed

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,680
our community to step up and finish the

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,380
fundraise we used open collective and

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,600
had over 40 individuals and companies in

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,430
the Drupal space donate money it was an

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,440
astonishing effort we are super happy

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,540
this is only a few people who are

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,920
involved but once we finally got the

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,860
funding we were able to hire Jill to do

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,170
the workshops the workshops covered how

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,960
to write a pitch how to write pick your

00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,520
topic your bio your speaker speaker bio

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
all of that stuff so anything you really

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,910
need to do a Drupal camp or con

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,050
successfully as well as a few things

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,910
that are targeted specifically at

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,160
underrepresented people again going back

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,230
to that sort of exaggerated impostor

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,450
syndrome effect that can happen Jackie

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,590
here is one of our attendees she is from

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,230
Los Angeles and she's a first-generation

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,430
American she always wanted to speak but

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,990
she felt like she didn't really have

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,730
anybody that looked like her to inspire

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,580
her to do so but after the workshops

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,140
she's now really excited to submit talks

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,050
all around Los Angeles about her

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,730
specialty of email marketing overall we

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,930
saw an increase in speaker confidence of

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,520
66% there's a huge huge improvement 30%

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,580
of our attendees are ready to give talks

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,130
tomorrow 30% are getting ready they're

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,330
on their way and 20% said they would

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,340
like to bring this back to their own

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,990
community to be able to spread the

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,800
impact of this work and get more voices

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,530

under represented person giving the the

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,950

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,610
Markos Khanna I got inspired to work on

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,860
the initiative back at Drupal con Dublin

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,959
and I've not been doing a lot of core

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,270
development before that time but I did

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,550
always want to contribute more so since

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,020
the lack of support for media and Drupal

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,149
core was always kind of frustrating to

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,820
me I thought it was a good place to

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,980
start helping out and I got really

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,140
overwhelmed at the start it was I really

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,580
feel like I jumped in the deep end but

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,490
over the years I got to work with a lot

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,740
of smart and inspiring people who really

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,510
helped me understand Drupal a lot better

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,770
but also became a better developer and

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,390
programmer yeah at the same time and I

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,550
think that's also the reason why I love

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,860
working on core so much even though the

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,930
process can be quite slow and painful at

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,240
times I think the people you work with

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,430
are amazing it's really some of the best

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,950
out there and also the fact that you

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,709
help shape the future of Grupo is really

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,589
something I enjoy for the media

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,959
initiative in particular I love the fact

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:40,079
that it's very visible work so we have a

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,180
lot of user facing features and since I

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,310
studied interaction design I really love

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,980
working on things where humans and

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,410
machines interact and also the fact that

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,020
a lot of sites could potentially use the

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,680
media module is also something I really

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,300
like to work on from a technical

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,270
perspective I love the complexity of the

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,120
module so we have custom entities got

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,089
some plug-in types we have widgets a lot

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,770
of super advanced Ajax stuff and yeah

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,010
there's really a lot to learn and a lot

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,320
to

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,500
enjoy at the same time really so I keep

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,900
learning a lot and since we have a lot

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,360
of user-facing features we also work a

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,480
lot with the UX and accessibility teams

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,990
and working with them really helped put

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,180
more focus on UX and accessibility in

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,490
general and that not only benefits the

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,940
initiative but also work the work I do

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:37,810
besides group work or as an initiative

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,730
we try to get together a lot we did some

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,580
dedicated sprints in Berlin and in

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,830
Barcelona and we also try to meet up at

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,140
things like DrupalCon and deaf days and

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,120
stuff like that and we get to share

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,220
ideas we get to collaborate in real life

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,260
and build consensus at times and it's

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,170
not only very important and helpful but

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,140
it's also really fun to do for the last

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,770
couple of years we tried to get the

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,990
media library module ready we started

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,190
last year with a sprint in Barcelona

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,560
where we got together with some core

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,900
committers people from the UX team and

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,250
product managers and rethink and

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,160
redesign the library with all the

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,770
lessons we learned in the past and one

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,600
thing we decided on was to design the

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,640
new media library with some constraints

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,980
in mind which is also not very Drupal II

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,800
instead of trying to solve all use cases

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,570
super flexibly we just try to focus on

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,460
the most important things and just do

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,760
them really well and that really

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,970
benefitted the end results if you ask me

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,680
so for the future we are first trying to

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,500
get the media library module stable

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,570
which is very close but I'm not really

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,030
sure we're going to make 8.8 but

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,920
hopefully we do and after that we have

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,540
some important UX and accessibility

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,130
improvements to make so that's also

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,980
something we really want to work on for

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,840
a Drupal 9 and after that we try to get

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,320
the media media library modules enabled

00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,170
in a standard profile and since a lot of

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,030
people got together and work so hard on

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,250
the media media library module I think

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,650
it's also important to thank everyone I

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,180
really proud of what we accomplished and

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:14,050
proud of all the people who worked on it

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,460
so a big thanks to everyone involved but

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,400
at the same time I also want to ask

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,980
everybody here to try and help us out

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,870
where you can not only writing patches

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,270
but also just

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,310
installing the module testing it seeing

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,000
how we can improve and give us feedback

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:34,180
it's really important and yeah hopefully

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,800
you can help us out so thank you

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:45,500
[Applause]

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,570
alright workflow initiative I want to

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,730
start by thanking everyone who's been

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,530
involved with this initiative for the

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,690
last couple of years it's been a lot of

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,750
people it has helped in all sorts of

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,160
ways if you're on the screen or if you

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,670
know that you've contributed in any

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:07,060
other way please stand up and Ray I see

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,060
you come on a round of applause everyone

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:18,010
it really has been quite a journey five

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,910
years give or take we've been involved

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,380
with trying to make this work if you if

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,769
you appreciate all the work that all

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,410
these contributors have have done do

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:32,110
send the tweet with the hashtag work for

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:37,000
initiative and celebrate with us on on

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,949
Twitter we've we've really come through

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,930
some some quite major achievements

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,820
during the this year so I'm not going to

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,000
go through this list in great detail

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,490
because each and every item is almost a

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,310
major initiative in and of itself but

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,730
notably a long list of entity types have

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,800
been converted to be revision able and

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,560
publishable we've committed three new

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,079
modules to core the work with draft

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,370
revisions in in different ways and we've

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,740
also fixed a long list of off bugs

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:11,320
but all good things do unfortunately

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,410
come to an end as well Drupal 8.8 will

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,070
be our final major milestone for now at

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:20,290
least the initiative initiative will

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,880
effectively go into maintenance mode and

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,339
we're going to keep taking care of the

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,370
modules that we've contributed and all

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,079
the functionality and we're going to

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,760
look for a new ways of kind of

00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:36,690
sustaining this work into the future

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:40,029
sustaining open-source is really hard

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:42,850
five years of development can be as much

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,380
as a multi-million dollars worth of

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,180
investment for a company or an

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,750
organization that wants to do something

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,029
like this

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,170
I keep thinking a lot about this there's

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,029
been a lot of discussion in the

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,570
community as well of how we make this

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,610
work

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,730
and I kind of want to figure out how we

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,740
can do this more in repeatable patterns

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,760
and enable more companies and

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,410
organizations to do the same in fact I'm

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,990
going to talk in much more detail about

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:12,069
this on Wednesday at quarter past five

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:15,250
in room G 107 to do come and join me

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:17,769
there for the work flow initiative it's

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,660
been more or less a single company that

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,790
has kind of been driving this and it's

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,290
been a fine balance between you know

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,779
figuring out what the community wants

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,310
and

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,550
we want to get out of the initiative as

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:31,160
well some in this session I'm gonna give

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,230
some of my own opinions on what we can

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,689
do better as organizations and also as a

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,129
community I'm going to wrap this up by

00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:39,709
talking about a new exciting feature

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,480
that we're looking to get into 8.8

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,850
something we call hierarchical

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,620
workspaces but I'll start by explaining

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,559
explaining first of all what a workspace

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,720
is so a workspace is this isolated place

00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:54,350
on your site we can work on multiple

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,259
changes at one at one time and publish

00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,230
them at the same time hierarchical

00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,480
workspaces then enables multiple

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,689
workspaces to to play together

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,730
imagine you run a magazine and you want

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:12,319
to start preparing your winter issue

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,970
with the lots of draft content but at

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,519
the same time you want to start

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,170
preparing your new year issue new year

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,860
happens during winter at least in the

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,329
northern hemisphere so you want to work

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,860
on these things at the same time so the

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,279
way it works is that published content

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,079
is automatically inherited downwards so

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,120
that grace and and Margaret here in this

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,100
case can kind of work on these changes

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,110
together where Margaret inherits all the

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,389
changes that grace is working on in the

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:42,379
winter issue and then they can merge and

00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:44,480
publish changes up streams upstream I'm

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,220
gonna show a demo here in just a moment

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,279
so on the Left we have the live

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,889
workspace will switch over to the winter

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,709
issue workspace in just a moment and on

00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:58,490
the Left we have Margaret she's working

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:01,309
on the new year issue workspace so we're

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:06,470
gonna start by making some changes in

00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:08,480
the winter issue workspace the changes

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,539
that grace is doing here

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,669
will be automatically inherited down to

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,549
the new year issue so that more so the

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:20,199
Margaret on the right hand side can work

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:24,679
on her new year things at the same time

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:28,010
so we're saving these changes uploading

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:31,010
a new image and we can preview this one

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,299
change from multiple other changes at

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:37,010
one time and if we reload this child

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,640
workspace effectively we can see that

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,060
the changes

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,890
have been inherited downstream so now

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,300
Margaret in this new year issue

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,910
workspace she's going to do some

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,100
additional changes she wants to start

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,980
preparing for new years so she's gonna

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,400
remove every done at article from the

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:58,940
front page and do some changes to this

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,250
lovely milk chocolate recipe here so

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,470
we're changing the title and ending

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,270
another few bits and pieces and what's

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,570
important to understand here is that the

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,570
change is done downstream here we're not

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,180
leaked upwards so to speak to to the

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,110
parent workspace so we can review all

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,450
these multiple changes together so we

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,900
can see the changes here and if we

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,880
reload the winter issue workspace on the

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,650
left-hand side we won't see those

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,140
changes there yet because the workspaces

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:34,480
aren't merged yet so you can see how

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,830
they differ at this time if we're happy

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,110
we may be one of them bring together

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,300
these changes and start publishing them

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,600
so what we can do here is that we merge

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,570
this content upstream we see that

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,980
there's two changes we remove the

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,190
article from the front page and we

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,900
updated an image and we can now see that

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,170
these downstream changes are now

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,220
reflected upstream after that merge and

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,520
now if you want to go ahead and publish

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,010
this three changes will be published the

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,510
one workspace the one change that grace

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,820
already did along with the two other

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,900
that Margaret worked on we can go and

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,080
these changes that we've been talking

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,920
about shouldn't be if we switch to the

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,920
light workspace here

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:29,800
[Applause]

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,800
all right

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:46,360
okay hi everybody I'm Cristina Amelia's

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,270
secret non-robot the torque a front-end

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,610
developer all about and I'm you

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,740
excrement aynura and also I'm one of the

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,140
leads of the admin UI and JavaScript

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,330
modernization initiative but I'm just

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,429
one of the persons helping on the

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,679
initiative so there are several names

00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,140
there that are helping so everything is

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,110
started a few years ago several initial

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,179
two initiatives started at Vienna and we

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,390
came together and joined Anita

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:15,630
Jane work front in United last year and

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,540
recently we reach our first milestone

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:22,960
having cloud was an experimental team

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:25,690
into Drupal core so the initiative has

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,600
several parts one of one of them is the

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,990
JavaScript app another one is the user

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,200
research that was done a while ago and

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,300
also the Drupal design system and all of

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,160
them are trying to implement changes

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,700
into Drupal core several of them are

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,100
already there one of the main challenges

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,940
that we've had so far is with that we

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,730
didn't had enough designers to get an

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,370
work on the new design system so it was

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,300
blocking a lot of initiative so if you

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,740
know designers that know drop out please

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,320
explain them and there's an initiative

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,990
for this one of the things one of the

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,860
tools that we've been using is stigma

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:11,020
that goes at the beginning one of the

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,390
great resources because it goes several

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,840
designers working at the same time in

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,550
the same document from several places in

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,040
the wall so it's but it got really

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,530
really helpful to have this sense of a

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,740
team another thing that will work well

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,790
was the collaboration between designers

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,179
and developers

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,309
because we've listened a lot when things

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:36,670
cooled and actually be implemented or

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,200
where some things like was on weren't

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,750
good enough on an accessibility

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,030
perspective so it's been a really good

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,540
thing another thing that has been a

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,309
challenge is that every design needed to

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,679
be super flexible because you know

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:53,260
Drupal you can just enable some more

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,290
modules and everything changes so the UI

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,800
that we were presenting had to be super

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:02,050
flexible for and give solutions for

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,150
anything that rupal can show another

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,610
thing that really work well was the

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,550
iteration over the feedback that we were

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,550
getting from people one of the examples

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,410
were was for example this on on the left

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,770
you can see the first design that we had

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,290
four fields and then we jumped over for

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,559
the focus into something that goes more

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,210
general and also something that we need

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,059
to take care is that we can't actually

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,190
break people's Drupal because we are

00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:33,309
working on and I'm gonna stretch on

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,040
theme and we need to be sure that

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:40,090
everybody just keeps the same interface

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,919
when they update their Drupal site and

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,090
something that we also needed to take

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,120
into account is the backwards

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,550
compatibility because as I was saying we

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,990
can't change people's interfaces and if

00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,429
they are used to have things on one

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,030
place they will need to have it

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:56,590
everywhere after updating and changing

00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:00,100
the layout for example something that we

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:03,240
want to do could wasn't possible to do

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,070
that just on a small release so

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,410
something that it will be important you

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,240
to remember is that now is better know

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,760
is an experimental core Claire is in

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,160
there so please test it because we need

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,070
to find all the bugs as soon as we can

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,010
so we can have a stable release ideally

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,980
and hopefully for the next Drupal

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:27,160
release something that we struggle to be

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,960
it was the communication it's been a

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,179
little bit hard as you've seen there are

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,940
several parts of the initiative so it's

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,220
been really hard to communicate what

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,190
goes the state of the author of the

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:43,120
initiative each part to find the same

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,950
goals and work together on things so an

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,140
opportunity that we have right now being

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,260
into Drupal core is that we will be able

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,090
to have the new documentation so we will

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,490
need a lot of people actually updating

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,380
this documentation here's the there's

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,929
the the link where you can actually go

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,360
and help test Claro and help creating

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,940
this documentation so we can get more

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,590
people helping there will have if you

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,500
want to see the new

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,110
we'll have session on Wednesday morning

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:28,390
and please common Thursday to the

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:29,320
sprints we'll be there thank you hi I'm

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,600
Ted Bowman

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,309
Ted Bowen drupal.org I work for Okwe as

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,529
part of the Drupal acceleration team and

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:38,919
I'm the one of the co maintainer zubba

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:41,950
layout builder module so the beginnings

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,010
of the layout initiative for Drupal 8 so

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,110
started with the seed started back in

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,789
2006 with the first release of the

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,140
panel's module and continued with

00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:55,149
modules such as displace we in context

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,039
and though a lot of good development

00:24:55,149 --> 00:25:00,779
went into those modules we have a lot

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,100
more people to thank than that

00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,260
throughout the next decade a lot of

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,750
users push these modules in new ways

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,669
that the developers hadn't imagined and

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,159
they provided valuable feedback from

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,720
real-world use cases improving the

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,669
developer site builder and end user

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,559
experiences of these modules they filed

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:20,080
bug reports and provided patches that

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,909
improved all these modules at the height

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,220
of Drupal 7 half of all triple sites

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:26,200
either had panels context or displaced

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,110
feet installed obviously this was

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,149
something that Drupal sites needed

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:33,340
deciding which solutions to use though

00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:38,880
was often daunting for new and even

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:41,500
experienced rupal users so the layout

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,909
initiative in Drupal 8 was an attempt to

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,130
learn from all these solutions in this

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,210
space it tried to make strive to make

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,950
the system that could be used

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,200
out-of-the-box by site builders and

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,260
content authors but also could be

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,490
extended in new ways by developers

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,320
additionally it was formed by regular

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,299
meetings with the drupal UX team and

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,120
input from drupal's accessibility

00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,250
maintainer x' layout borrowers mark

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,320
stable and Drupal 8.7 and now the

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,940
contributed module space is exploding

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,590
with useful modules that extend layout

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,779
builder I'll list if you're here today

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,149
but there are many more maybe some more

00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,860
we made it this week layout builder

00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:17,080
restrictions allows you to streamline

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,700
the layout builder interface for site

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,799
builders and content authors

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,869
the layout Butler library module allows

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,730
you to make premade layouts for your

00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:26,950
content authors to select from and

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,169
layout folder Styles allows themers to

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,659
create predefined styles to apply to

00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:39,309
your sections and blocks for

00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:41,169
translations we have two modules layout

00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:43,059
builder symmetric translation keeps your

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:45,340
layouts in sync across all your

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:48,100
translations but allows you to have

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,409
custom translations of your inline

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,389
blocks and other strings while layout

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,799
builder asymmetric translations allows

00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:56,230
each language to have a totally

00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,489
independent layout with unique blocks

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,809
it's often more fused for localization

00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:04,419
currently is easier than ever to get

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:07,539
involved with the work of the layout

00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:10,029
initiative the long slog of getting

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,499
layout builder stable is over there are

00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,539
many features that are being worked on

00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:19,659
that need help for many different types

00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:21,340
of users so for drupal 9 as we look

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,320
forward to triple 9 in these modules and

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,419
real-world use cases of layout builder

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,509
will inform the future of layout builder

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:32,350
and layout in general in core as much as

00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:35,169
the contribs context and displace we

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:39,190
also led to the drupal 8 layout

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:41,259
initiative itself so what's next what

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,239
features of these modules do we think

00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,789
belong in core what features of layout

00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:47,679
builder are currently missing what is

00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,580
the 80% use case of layout builder

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,609
should the layout API use being used be

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:59,019
used in new ways inside Drupal core so

00:27:54,609 --> 00:28:00,429
how can you help we need help from if

00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,200
you're a core contributor working on

00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,330
improving layout builder in core your

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,980
part of the layout but our initiative if

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,080
you're a module developer building great

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,629
things on top of layout builder and the

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,570
layout API your part of the layout

00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:15,850
initiative if you're a site builder

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,279
putting all these things together in new

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,929
ways that nobody has thought of yet

00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,230
you're also part of the layout

00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:25,749
initiative if you're a Content author

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:28,179
using any and all of these all of the

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:29,910
above on a daily basis then you're also

00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:33,060
part of layout builder

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,970
initiative so it's up to us here and

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,400
everybody in the larger Drupal community

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:42,680
to decide you know what the shape of

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,850
layouts is in Drupal 9 and beyond

00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,970
there's a lot of possibilities that

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,850
could happen and so we need feedback

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,250
from as many people as possible and just

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,530
like all the other initiatives up here

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,470
we're always looking for for people that

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,450
can help developers people with us

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,820
experience in all kinds of different

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,200
experience we have a couple sessions

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,180
this week tomorrow

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,770
Tim Plunkett Co maintainer layout

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,540
builder module is doing what's next for

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,770
the layout initiative so he'll go in

00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,960
much more depth than I did

00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:18,660
and on Wednesday Boris oh boy Yen force

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,490
of off sorry for your name it's brown

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,650
Suriname is doing looking at a larger

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,890
scope of the layout builder module

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:28,110
ecosystem and on Thursday please come to

00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,960
the contribution day where you can help

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:34,470
on layout builder core issues but also

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,350
I'm sure a lot of the contribute on to

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,120
help on those so thanks a lot and we

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:46,590
look forward to you getting involved

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:49,390
[Applause]

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,430
hello and welcome to some story time

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,410
about configuration management from

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,450
Drupal eight point zero to eight point

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,780
eight

00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,760
you know configuration management has

00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,130
been a new feature for to Drupal 8 and

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,830
there was a CMI that was successfully

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,180
completed for the first release of

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,640
Drupal 8

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm Fabien bear here I worked for nuvola

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:16,660
and I'm a co initiative lead for CM I -

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,630
and I maintained a couple of fairly

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:23,260
popular contrib modules that deal with

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:26,320
configuration for example config split

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:30,120
has risen recently reached 1 million

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:34,020
downloads on Drupal at work so Drupal

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:37,660
8.00 came with this amazing new feature

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:40,060
it allowed you to export all your

00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,620
configuration and then import all your

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:47,550
configuration again but unfortunately

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:50,080
that that was it and for example

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,730
development modules were not something

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,990
that you could do so drush already

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,270
before eight-zero was shipped had a flag

00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,890
that you could add to the import and

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,590
export commands that would allow you to

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,150
skip modules so you you can have your

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,420
development modules and then skip them

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:09,370
and they wouldn't be exported

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,200
unfortunately though there was a bug and

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:15,700
the dependencies of these modules were

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:18,550
still exported and not skipped but this

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,460
feature in inrush was built on a very

00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:27,970
simple configuration filter approach and

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:30,850
then in in 2016 I created a module

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,980
called config split that built on top of

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:36,820
this configuration filter approach but

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,740
completed it and it would split the

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,590
development modules come together with

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:44,980
their convict dependencies in into a

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,290
separate folder based on this then later

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,730
also came like the sort of API part of

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,320
it

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,360
config filter but it was not feature

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,490
equivalent you could not just give it a

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,050
list of modules that you you would never

00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:01,500
want to export so someone created

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,160
issue and then because it was not really

00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,170
a good fit for it created a separate

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,790
module called config exclude that did

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:15,540
that changing gears a bit in early 2018

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:19,650
we decided that it we wanted to build a

00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:21,810
better core way of doing configuration

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:27,630
management so we started a new

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:31,050
initiative and we we met at developer

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:33,210
days but then around Drupal Europe one

00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:36,980
year ago we kind of agreed that we

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,240
wanted to have an event based API but

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,370
rather than just putting config

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,160
filtering into core but we didn't really

00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:47,720
know how to put just the API into core

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:51,240
because we need to also use the API so

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,720
at Drupal con Seattle we created a plan

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,150
we created a lot of issues of how like

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,750
each step in broken down little pieces

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:05,250
on how we're gonna get this done but

00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:07,200
then as the summer progressed and life

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,870
happens and not a lot of people have

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,030
worked on this it was getting clear that

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,550
we were not going to make it and it was

00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:18,150
going to be very sad so we had to think

00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:21,240
like okay how how can we how can we

00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:23,400
still do something and we went back to

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,000
the drawing board and kind of thought

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,790
what are their expectations what what do

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,180
we need to realign to to still make this

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,840
happen

00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:35,370
and talking with a couple of people in

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,800
the Drupal community we came to the

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,290
conclusion that actually this original

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,990
feature that rush had that you could

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:46,080
just skip the modules was was actually a

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:50,310
very good use case that core could have

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,590
and so with the help of the maintainer

00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:56,700
config exclude we ported it to the new

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:59,250
API and added it to core and because it

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,360
has no UI and and really very very

00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:07,050
limited configuration options it could

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,380
be done relatively quickly and so just a

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,710
few weeks before the deadline or a few

00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,389
days actually we

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,399
you get everything stable and committed

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:19,690
to to the place it needs to be in core

00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:24,750
so I think that's quite an ya success

00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,750
and and something to celebrate really

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:30,580
for those who of you are more interested

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:34,060
there will be a session later today at

00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,399
from 5:00 to 6:00 in G 110 where we'll

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,859
go much more into detail of all the

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,169
other things in configuration management

00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,570
initiative and also where there is still

00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:54,040
a lot of help needed from from all of

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:56,470
you thank you very much hey a quick

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,150
reminder you can ask any of us questions

00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:03,460
on Twitter using the hashtag Drupal

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,080
initiatives just saying hey I'm wim

00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,710
Lear's I work in the Drupal acceleration

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,750
team a taqueria

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,640
and I'm one of the three API first

00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,380
initiative coordinators the other two

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,050
are delightfully pink people standing

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,760
next to me in the photo Matteo from all

00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,160
abouts and Gabe is a colleague of mine a

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,380
Takuya and we have pretty different

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,330
perspectives we challenge each other but

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,700
usually we end up at a consensus that is

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,880
better than our individual proposals and

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,599
the three of us spends more than a year

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,550
scrutinizing the country module that

00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,440
Matty who had originally built vetting

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,630
it against the spec getting it ready for

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,940
core inclusion and it was a huge effort

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,859
but the result is now that it's easier

00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,990
than ever before to build decoupled

00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:43,510
applications on Drupal and a lower

00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:46,119
barrier to entry is really exciting it

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,260
was not just the three of us so people

00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,349
all over the world and from many

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:53,619
companies made it happen and more than

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:55,330
100 people in fact that only about 50 of

00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,250
which have actually contributed code and

00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,020
so more than 50 actually contributed in

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,849
other ways on through code through

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,290
manual testing improving documentation

00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:04,810
and so on and that has been of

00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,430
tremendous help speaking of lowering the

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,230
barrier to entry long time

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,480
Drupal user bejeebies recently returned

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,520
to triple and instead of running a

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,260
public Drupal site he's now running it

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,970
in his basement on his home server with

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,580
cron jobs importing for his from Google

00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,109
and then he generates a static site by

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,060
talking to JSON API getting the

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:24,369
constants out and he was surprised by

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,600
how fun and simple it was and he did

00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:27,460
that before this tool was

00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,470
available the JSON API Explorer tool

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,960
which was built by my colleagues a

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:34,570
taqueria Peter and Gabe it's a visual

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,610
query builder with live results and it

00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,580
talks to your own JSON API instance

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:41,170
meaning it's showing something actually

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,360
for your site and you can choose what

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,430
you filter by what to include what which

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,980
fields to fetch and so on and it's not

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,360
just that one tool that exists lots of

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,250
people are building various tools an

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,860
entire ecosystem is growing around JSON

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,290
API from automatic aliy uploading static

00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,430
Jason to s3 for example to adding

00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,980
capabilities not yet covered by this

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:03,070
back to customizations of responses the

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,900
list keeps growing and one example that

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,210
was just recently released by Elliot war

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,310
from interactive investor was the Jason

00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,750
API reference module I'm sure that

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,250
pretty much everyone in the room here

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,290
today knows what an entity reference

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,180
feel is it's just like that but instead

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,850
of referencing an entity in Drupal

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,430
you're referencing data in a JSON API

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:24,430
instance and that opens a lot of

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,410
interesting new possibilities my

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,660
colleagues Peter and Gabe have also been

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,760
working on adding hypermedia supports to

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,010
JSON API and that essentially means that

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,930
you're adding relevant links depending

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,330
on the state of the data so for example

00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,980
a commons that can be replied to or can

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,990
be approved gets a reply link or an

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,310
approved link in the JSON which makes it

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,800
very easy to build applications like the

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,150
one that you're seeing here there are

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,550
Drupal community members out there

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,320
operating JSON API instances today

00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,770
serving millions of requests per day

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,270
they helped identify bottlenecks and

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,040
helped us discover problems that we

00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,930
cannot discover without such a big

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,700
workloads and that's also an example of

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,220
non code contributions for example

00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,920
Nikolai the Premera from ffw played an

00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,720
important role in that our JSON API

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,670
implementation can also easily be scaled

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,740
to numbers even bigger than millions per

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,200
day because it uses triples unique

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,080
caching capabilities this chart here is

00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,580
powering is a JSON API instance powering

00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,980
a product launch site and a peak it was

00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:24,930
it was serving more than 300,000

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:27,430
requests a second per 30 minutes sorry

00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,810
thanks to work big work Louis like that

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,370
we were able to make Jason API a lot

00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,320
faster in the upcoming Drupal 8 release

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,320
special thanks to Nikolay again but also

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,240
jibraan Aegis from previous next JSON

00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,520
API will be at least twice as fast for

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,130
everyone and three times or more

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,660
faster for most of us and now that's not

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,030
just thanks to caching but also thanks

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,260
to algorithmic improvements and so the

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,570
three of us are really proud and happy

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,910
to see that Drupal's JSON API is being

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,220
used widely by both enterprise and

00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,900
hobbyists and we cannot wait to see how

00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:11,890
all of you will be adding to the

00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:14,650
ecosystem thank you hi I'm Greg Anderson

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,170
I'm a core services engineer at Pantheon

00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,480
and I also do a lot of open source stuff

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,310
you've probably seen me here and there

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,440
on the queues doing things with drush

00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:26,020
and some of the libraries that go into

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,850
that and other similar to lis type

00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,740
things and today I'm going to talk to

00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:32,290
you about another truly type thing which

00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,780
is called Composer we've done a neat

00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,970
thing for a drupal 8 8 oh it's called a

00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,050
composer initiative of course Drupal has

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:43,210
been using composer since 8.0 point-o

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:46,210
but now we're moving it into core with

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:51,100
the goal of making tarballs

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:54,610
Composer ready from the get-go and it

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,740
took a lot of work to do that and we had

00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,870
to be really focused and so today I

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,400
wanted to talk a little bit about the

00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,470
things that we had to do in order to

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,880
make as much progress as we did since

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:08,230
Drupal con Seattle sometimes during core

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,240
development and can be kind of slow

00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,550
where issues have to just sort of sit

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,690
there and wait so one of the reasons

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,490
that we were able to make a lot of

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,950
progress is we built on existing tools

00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,590
Drupal Composer Drupal project the

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,720
Drupal scaffold project and the web flow

00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,180
tools like duplic or strict were already

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,130
there and the community had a good idea

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,080
about how to use them and they worked

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,930
well but even though they work very well

00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,150
we still had ideas about how to make

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,920
them better so we came together at

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,440
Drupal con Seattle and we talked

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,840
specifically about how to focus on the

00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,910
scaffold tool and make the configuration

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,200
for that a lot better and more focused

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,430
and we had this great plan that we're

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,920
going to get it all committed there at

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,900
Seattle but that didn't quite work out

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,300
it took a little bit longer than we

00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,790
thought it would so we started a process

00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:58,340
holding meetings every two weeks where

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,260
we could make plans and see if we could

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,050
make new milestones and we used that

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,630
initiative or a format that was started

00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,430
by the Drupal diversity inclusion

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,960
initiative where we take meetings in

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,640
slack where they can happen

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,610
asynchronously and it's worked out

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,660
really well

00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,550
collaboration it's also really important

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,610
to get your issues committed you have to

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,160
get them from needs work to RT BC but

00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,630
sometimes they'll move back to needs

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,250
work and we need to get them back into

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,110
needs review as quickly as possible so

00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:30,500
it helps to have two people working on

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:33,050
the getting it to needs review step and

00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,740
it's also good to have someone who's

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:39,230
just working on the RT BC steps

00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,750
you can't RT BC your own issue so he

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,790
communicated a lot in slack so we could

00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,440
keep notes with each other and say hey

00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,780
could you help me get this back to it

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,420
needs review or I need a review to get

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,670
this - RT BC and when it was ready would

00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,740
also ping the core committers directly

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,420
and I really want to thank the core

00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,520
committers who really focused on our

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,080
issue we had a bunch of things that were

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,070
happening simultaneously and every now

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,630
and then we have an issue that was

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,370
blocked and if he told the core

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,840
committer that we were blocked on

00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,030
something they would give us priority

00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,980
and we probably couldn't have finished

00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,770
if they hadn't been so attentive to our

00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,750
needs so if you want to get involved

00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,390
with initiatives and replicate some of

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,220
the success my first bit of advice is to

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,330
keep recruiting people are gonna get

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:25,310
busy and fall away so you have to keep

00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:27,530
evangelizing making people feel guilty

00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,690
doesn't work really well but if you just

00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,520
show a lot of passion if you're working

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:35,330
on something that gets people interested

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,600
and that'll drive them to join give good

00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,220
feedback during the process we had an

00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,660
issue that went to RT BC and we're all

00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,060
hoping to get it committed someone moved

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,860
it back to needs work and said oh I'm so

00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,720
sorry but that's really important

00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,190
because it take there's a cost to

00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,630
waiting for that core committer if we

00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,670
can find out that it needs to go back to

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,460
it needs work sooner that's that's

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,560
really good to know and it's also

00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,330
important to be persistent if you're

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,660
learning how to be better at sports ball

00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,880
or trying to get an issue committed to

00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,619
Drupal you're better off being really

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,779
consistent and spending

00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:11,089
of time over and over again rather than

00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:13,849
having occasional spurts of really hard

00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,480
efforts so remember we're all in this

00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:16,640
together

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,519
we're going down the same road please

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:24,049
focus on your relationships get those

00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,269
mentorship programs going and you know

00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:29,779
community is really the key to keep that

00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:32,450
persistence and continuity and if you go

00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:35,180
to g1 a dot IO Composer that'll pop you

00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,950
over to your project page remember you

00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:40,190
can ask questions if any of these other

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,230
maintained errs by using Twitter hashtag

00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,519
Drupal initiatives but if you want to

00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,930
know more about the composer initiative

00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,269
used to probably come to the Driss note

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,539
here tomorrow or our session in room G

00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:51,630
106 Wednesday at 10:15 thanks I hope to

00:43:50,539 --> 00:44:00,039
see a lot of you there

00:43:51,630 --> 00:44:00,039
[Applause]

00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,839
I'm gonna be telling the story of the

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,420
promote Drupal pitch deck which is just

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:18,260
one part of the promote Drupal

00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:21,890
initiative and this is really the story

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:27,890
about how this and how this project came

00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:31,280
to be my name is suzanne durga Chava and

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,079
I I do a lot of marketing related

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,309
activities these days but my background

00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,200
is actually not in marketing over the 12

00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:43,329
years I've spent reading a Drupal agency

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,940
I've developed a passion for content and

00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:48,680
good communication and design and so

00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,319
when I saw the promote Drupal initiative

00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,589
take off at Drupal con Nashville a few

00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:56,630
years ago I got really inspired it was

00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:58,730
launched to coordinate community efforts

00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:01,010
to promote Drupal and really get people

00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:06,920
working together to expand the the

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:09,920
market for Drupal last year just one

00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,990
year ago at Drupal Europe I had my first

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,970
chance to get involved in the effort I

00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,789
actually went to an agency leaders

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,650
roundtable that Rachel from the Drupal

00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:20,990
Association organized and we had lots of

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,260
really great conversations there about

00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:27,190
how to help agencies like what agencies

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:30,170
actually need and it turns out that

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,779
small and medium agencies in the Drupal

00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:35,150
space really need help selling Drupal to

00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:38,960
new markets and help figuring out what

00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:41,480
messages what content people want to

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,220
hear when they're considering a content

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,839
management system a lot of the times

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:48,650
we're kind of in the Drupal space and we

00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,029
don't think about this bigger picture so

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,730
a small group of us there at that

00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:54,920
roundtable Paul Johnson Ricardo Romero

00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,720
and I came up with this notion of a

00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,880
pitch deck we thought this would be a

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,700
really easy kind of first step something

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,770
really actionable we could do to give

00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:07,250
agencies a common set of talking points

00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,660
when when talking about Drupal so we set

00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,130
up a Trello board to kind of get

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,079
ourselves organized

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:14,539
and we we decided to take a really small

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,460
first step which was to get input from

00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:19,730
all those other agency leaders out there

00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,680
so we put together a survey and just

00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,750
asked the community what they needed and

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,890
it turned out this was a great first

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,250
step because we got a lot of good

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,930
feedback and we found out that something

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,380
really useful for people would be able

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:36,019
to tell tell stories about how Drupal is

00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,940
used in different industries so we

00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:41,569
wanted to get a whole bunch of case

00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,700
studies and testimonials from around the

00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:45,589
world of how people are using Drupal

00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,809
just like really good success stories

00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,250
that we could all draw from and we also

00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:50,900
thought it would be good to have some

00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:53,420
key talking points so when you're

00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,710
selling Drupal to higher ed or to

00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,200
government you know you really need to

00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,819
talk about security and accessibility so

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,940
what is some really powerful content

00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:04,759
that we can all use to just speak about

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,019
Drupal in that way and focus on the

00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:09,710
points that are most salient to

00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:12,319
customers we also collected some

00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,990
impressive facts because there's lots of

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:17,480
impressive facts about Drupal that we we

00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,549
we don't always mention so we put

00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,359
together some some facts and figures

00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:26,470
that we could include in this pitch deck

00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:26,470
talking about what makes Drupal great

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,880
now pitch deck is not just all about

00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:34,579
content and having a message you also

00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,250
need to have design so having that

00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:40,400
passion for a design is really important

00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:44,630
so I actually drew some designers into

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,880
this process two designers on my team

00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,890
stepped in and helped take the brand

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,500
guidelines for Drupal there's actually a

00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:54,700
brand book for Drupal and apply that to

00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,109
our pitch deck we wanted to be able to

00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,589
to pitch Drupal in more than one

00:47:57,109 --> 00:48:00,349
language

00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:03,859
so Paul Johnson actually came up with

00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:05,809
this great idea to manage all the pitch

00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:08,119
deck content in Drupal so we could get

00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:10,730
it localized and that means that we can

00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,920
actually talk about Drupal in many

00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:16,130
different languages so it's in the

00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,380
process of being translated now into

00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:20,690
many many languages which is very

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,810
exciting I think this is one of the most

00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:28,700
powerful parts of the project and

00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:31,400
a lot of flexibility another aspect

00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,070
that's now underway is that by having

00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,390
all of the content for the pitch deck in

00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:40,430
Drupal we can also customize the pitch

00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,400
decks themselves so people will be able

00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:45,230
to export the slides and the deck that

00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,860
they want to use to pitch Drupal to

00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:51,350
their audience whatever that is so you

00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,820
can find out about more about promote

00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,560
Drupal in general if you have other

00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,050
ideas for projects that you want to

00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,880
launch this started last year at Drupal

00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:01,480
Europe so there's room for more projects

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,700
like this come to our boss tomorrow

00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,680
tomorrow afternoon or you can reach out

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,160
to me or any of the other initiative

00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:17,440
folks directly thanks

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:20,329
[Applause]

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,970
well here I am

00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:25,400
hi I'm Ellie I'm here to speak to you

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,829
about Drupal core mentoring we are a

00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,829
group of mentors and organizers who help

00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:32,599
people become contributors to Drupal and

00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:35,299
I guess I've been involved with

00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,940
mentoring since around DrupalCon vienna

00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:40,369
or maybe austin it's been a little while

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,650
now but mentoring really got started

00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:45,049
back at Drupal con Denver so this is a

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:47,509
representative image from 2012 of Tim

00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:49,490
Plunkett showing some folks how to work

00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:52,400
with patches I think they may be writing

00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:55,700
a patch there but the core office hours

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:59,269
concept really came from xjm suggesting

00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:02,119
that after a lot of success with core

00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:05,150
office hours in 2011 I started doing

00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:07,519
that on a regular basis on IRC and over

00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,609
the years grew the program to where we

00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,829
had 30 mentors at Drupal con Nashville

00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:15,200
last spring and we've brought it from

00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:18,650
around 100 contributors learning how to

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,079
contribute to like 250 at one of these

00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:24,140
Thursday are usually Friday contribution

00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,609
events at Drupal con so a lot of what

00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,170
the mentors do at this point is

00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:29,720
organized around the larger Drupal

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,809
events as well as some of the camps so

00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,400
this is Drupal Europe last year that's

00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:37,400
Friday morning getting folks ready to

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,009
start contributing it's sort of an

00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,420
ongoing cycle of what we need to do so

00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:43,009
there's the organizing beforehand

00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,750
there's the event and then there's a lot

00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:47,390
of retrospective afterwards so we are

00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,130
always changing and iterating on the

00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,690
program and I will be speaking about

00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,650
that on Wednesday afternoon if anybody

00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:56,569
wants to see that I think one of the

00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,700
coolest things about mentoring is that

00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:00,700
there's sort of a cascade effect so

00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,529
instead of just a mentor and a mentee

00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,630
you have you know mentors mentoring each

00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:09,380
other like Kathy is an excellent example

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:11,839
of a mentor of mentors but it's it's

00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,910
also a collaborative web of people

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,880
contributing and mentoring each other

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,970
and everybody is a mentor and a

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,309
contributor that's the message here and

00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:24,259
oh I should also mention adding your

00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:26,539
mentors to your drupal.org profile is a

00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:28,369
really nice way to say thank you

00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:30,380
but mentoring

00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,849
also happen places that are not these

00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,430
in-person events not everybody can make

00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:35,720
it to these so I highly recommend if

00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,789
you're not already on Drupal slack

00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,950
joining there are a lot of great

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:41,150
channels available like Drupal diversity

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:45,499
and inclusion pictured there in

00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:48,109
Nashville has a contribs base where you

00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:50,960
can find some projects to start working

00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:52,279
on a lot of what we hear from mentors

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,930
that these events is that there's sort

00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:56,119
of three different paths a new

00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,369
contributor takes you might mentor

00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:01,279
someone and they are just really excited

00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:02,749
to get started at all really excited to

00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:05,109
work with the tools to learn how to use

00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:07,549
the issue queue some of the basics and

00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:09,230
that's enough like they understand the

00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:12,319
community it's pretty exciting

00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:15,529
or you might mentor somebody and they

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,029
have a patch committed that very day we

00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:18,910
can't always make a live commit happen

00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:21,380
but when it does it's amazing validation

00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,839
or you might just keep contributing on

00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,210
your own and the third path is mentoring

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,650
someone and then they become a mentor

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,390
which is what happened to me this is

00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,519
Drupal con Austin I'm in the back and

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,079
those are some of the mentors who held

00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,529
my hand very patiently through a lot of

00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:38,239
rough times learning Drupal probably

00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:42,680
shouldn't say rough times it's been fun

00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:44,720
it's awesome but it's also really great

00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,099
to have somebody there who can help you

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,140
and you know you can reach out to them

00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:50,329
so if you're interested in being a

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,460
mentor or a contributor I recommend just

00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:55,069
come by our booth here in the exhibition

00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,349
hall we're behind amazes blue container

00:52:55,069 --> 00:53:01,519
just kind hard to miss it so we're over

00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:04,789
there and if you want to mentor come by

00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:06,799
mentor orientation today or Wednesday we

00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:10,730
will show you the ropes help you get

00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:12,380
started and the other thing I'd hope you

00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,420
all noticed in all the presentations

00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:17,390
today is that folks need help with their

00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,109
initiatives so if you already kind of

00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,700
know what you're doing with the issue

00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:20,989
queue you might want to just join one of

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,170
their initiatives in the general

00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:26,089
contribution room and otherwise come to

00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,549
the first-time contributor workshop for

00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:30,710
that I think we have one tomorrow and

00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:33,739
one on Thursday we will help you get

00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,720
started learning issue cue learning

00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,039
maybe you just need a drupal.org account

00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,339
there are lots of different ways to

00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,390
contribute to so you might need a local

00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:45,590
development environment or

00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:48,170
you might not this is a handy flowchart

00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:50,840
that gab are put together you can see

00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:55,430
that you you just follow the flowchart

00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:58,430
that's their great chart loved charts

00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:59,720
that's pretty much all I have to say I

00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,540
probably missed some of my speaker notes

00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,610
but that's cool finally I hope all of

00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:21,410
you speakers kept this in your decks

00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:22,790
thank you very much all right if we

00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,170
could have the Drupal initiatives

00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,180
hashtag on the screen that'd be awesome

00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,800
so as a reminder Drupal initiatives is

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,270
available for all of us to ask questions

00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,980
we do have a few but you can keep them

00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:33,050
coming in we do have still a few minutes

00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,990
I'm gonna start out with one which i

00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:38,000
think is kind of easy and it is can we

00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,010
participate the collective we

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,930
participate in these initiatives if if

00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,240
someone can participate your initiative

00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,800
could you please raise your hand yeah

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,720
that's everything for those who can't

00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:52,250
see livestream that was all of them I'm

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,100
asking for a volunteer to answer this

00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,960
one how can I get in contact with the

00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,280
initiatives is there centralized

00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,170
location could someone give some advice

00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,340
for somebody out there who's interested

00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:05,990
in maybe inspired by a couple of these

00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:07,880
anybody want to volunteer for oh I know

00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:10,490
for Drupal diversity and inclusion come

00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,220
to Drupal slack we have a channel -

00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:15,260
diversity - inclusion if you don't know

00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,870
which channel there's hashtag contribute

00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,610
we'll usually someone will tell you how

00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,050
to get in through that or in a hashtag

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,570
composer you want to get into the

00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,340
composer initiative what Greg said but

00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:28,660
for the API first initiative it's the

00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:31,090
content a channel that you want to join

00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:34,670
basically most of the initiatives have

00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:37,250
page on drupal.org that you can go in

00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,840
and you will have you will see the

00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,970
content the way to content each

00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,670
initiative and all the channels both on

00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:51,140
Drupal slag and maybe a Drupal chat or

00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:54,300
whatever in there awesome all right

00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:57,390
there's a question if we could have

00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,700
maybe two people answer this one how do

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,349
you organize or prioritize it the tasks

00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,750
of your initiative we could have just

00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:07,470
two people self elect to talk about that

00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:10,619
two different issues yeah we have a lot

00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:14,160
of contact with product managers about

00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:16,619
the things yeah that we can really

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,210
accomplish in a specific amount of time

00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:20,310
and amongst ourselves we have a lot of

00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:22,230
discussions of the things we think is

00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,530
important but we use the issue queue

00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:29,160
mostly to get the work in and just

00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:31,079
prioritize from there I can answer for

00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,609
composure initiative for us it was

00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,380
easier than maybe some of the

00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:36,390
initiatives because our tasks were

00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:40,140
fairly linear where one would block the

00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:43,319
next but there's a whole pile of issues

00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:46,200
that our area composer so we also added

00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:47,369
a tag composer initiative for just the

00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,020
small number of issues that we're

00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:51,390
actively working on right now so you can

00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,630
always look for that tag to see the act

00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:57,359
of things to participate in and the lay

00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:59,970
out initiative when we were getting

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,829
layout butter stable we had I think bio

00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,810
weekly meetings in Drupal slack and

00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:07,800
pound layout and also we would meet

00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:09,450
frequently with the UX team and that a

00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,190
lot of people who weren't necessarily I

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,599
guess considered themselves part of the

00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:15,030
layout initiative gave us a lot of good

00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,349
feedback I'm again product managers

00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,690
initially when we were looking at

00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:21,030
translations and layout builder we had a

00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:23,940
totally different idea then we got

00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:25,500
feedback from framework managers and

00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,990
product managers as far as like know

00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:32,460
that idea it's not what people expect so

00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:33,810
then we changed tact so yeah awesome and

00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,859
actually Ted if you could hold out of

00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:37,290
the mic because the next question

00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:38,550
specifically for you is there any

00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,829
momentum in the layout builder

00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:43,440
initiative to expand the usage to cover

00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:45,329
arbitrary pages for example those

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,790
created by custom modules or custom

00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:51,660
routes or via the page builder country

00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:54,000
module I have not seen that I've kind of

00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,190
been the last couple months I've been

00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,990
doing triple nine stuff yeah I know page

00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:02,609
manager had a patch for for using layout

00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,990
builder and page manager which would

00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:05,370
give you that

00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:08,160
but if people are interested in that

00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:11,040
feature you talk to us on Drupal slack

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,220
or propose an issue either and the ideas

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,870
queue for duple core or you could

00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:21,870
propose a feature directly for layout

00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:23,580
builder cool next one of god is actually

00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:25,110
not a question by thought I just share

00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:33,360
someone feels that workspaces are

00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:35,490
awesome so rank if you would tell us do

00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,440
you think the composer will also bring

00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:40,020
more consistency to how different Drupal

00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,770
distributions are installed and updated

00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:46,590
I think that will probably be answered a

00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:49,770
later time but yes mmm teasing

00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:55,890
tomorrow's keynote perhaps nudge nudge

00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:57,630
wink wink yes actually this is for

00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,970
anybody maybe have one or two different

00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,710
people answer this one it was mentioned

00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,050
several times that working on the core

00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:11,910
working on core could be a challenge as

00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:14,940
their initiative to change this so I

00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:17,880
think there's definitely things that we

00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,800
can improve with how we govern core and

00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,280
and how we work in core but I do want to

00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,110
highlight the fact that how we work with

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,420
core and how we contribute the core has

00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:30,780
already changed a lot in the past couple

00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:33,750
of years bringing scheduled releases to

00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:36,030
Drupal 8 semantic versioning has really

00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,610
made a huge difference and make it a lot

00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:40,590
easier to plan and kind of argue for

00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,570
getting changes into core so I think

00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:44,670
we've already done a ton of good changes

00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:51,330
surely we can continue improving but I

00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:52,950
just want to bring that out really yeah

00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,090
I would say it's yeah there's been a lot

00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,700
of I feel like it's an ongoing

00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,680
initiative maybe not named but it's been

00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,000
a lot of changes I mean compared to

00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:05,160
Drupal 7 right it's when we had like

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,250
multi-year release schedules no one had

01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,150
the incentives to to country contribute

01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,220
to core in itself

01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:13,260
I don't know if people know about the

01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,820
Drupal core ideas queue where you can if

01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,190
you don't feel like you want to jump in

01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,380
make patches that you can

01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,880
proposed changes to Drupal core or you

01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,200
can look through that queue to see what

01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,599
idea is already out there and give

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,940
feedback on them I just wanted to

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,890
highlight that sometimes it needs to be

01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,380
hard because we need to think about all

01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:32,150
the things not just it works it also

01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,859
needs to be usable it needs to be

01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,569
performance it needs to work for very

01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:37,700
big size for small sites and needs to be

01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:42,800
accessible and that takes a lot of work

01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:44,420
and documentation so there are a couple

01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,970
questions about starting an initiative

01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,190
or is that it like I would like an

01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,970
initiative for something that's not

01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,250
thought

01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,599
can anyone give advice for someone who

01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,220
would be interested in starting a new

01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,109
initiative how to propose that how to

01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:01,160
gather support how to make that actually

01:00:57,109 --> 01:01:03,230
so that they could be up here next so I

01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:07,010
would say one of the first things is

01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:08,960
first get together several people

01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,780
because for sure not everybody is going

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,300
to stay after some months the next step

01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:18,319
probably is going to be the feeling an

01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:21,589
issue into the ideas into from Drupal

01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:23,450
core Drupal org that's probably one of

01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:26,359
the best ways to start checking if

01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:29,750
people is interested in that promoting

01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:32,089
these issue and getting people to know

01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:36,440
about the issue to propose more things

01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:37,970
and after that getting supported to the

01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,040
initiative yep

01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:43,730
so the the issue queue to look at is

01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,440
Drupal org slash project slash ideas and

01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:47,930
so that's where new ideas for Drupal

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,109
core initiatives are being created and

01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:52,670
the intent is to create a plan where you

01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:54,800
outline where you want to get and how

01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,450
you want to get there but you should be

01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,420
doing it with multiple other people

01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:01,400
because doing it by yourself it's kind

01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,200
of impossible yeah usually getting

01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,329
someone that actually has some

01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,200
experience already on Drupal core or

01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:10,819
something similar will help you reach

01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,359
project product managers and other

01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:16,790
things that at the end are going to give

01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:20,140
you feedback and something so it's an

01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:22,970
it's like the following step after that

01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,050
also I'd like to say if possible get it

01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:26,540
working really really well

01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,930
outside of core and then make a pitch

01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:32,730
for why it's much

01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:34,410
to have it that's part of core awesome

01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,560
Suzanne we got one for you so if we need

01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:40,200
to make this Suzanne how will the pits

01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:43,890
back pitch deck be kept up to date as

01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,630
clients evolve platforms so when we

01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:49,080
first made the pitch deck like kind of

01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:52,320
the MVP version was just in Google

01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,240
slides so it's kind of hard in there to

01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,310
do things like versioning especially

01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,770
once you start adding translations you

01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,300
can imagine then you have you know a

01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:03,410
hundred versions of a pitch deck it's

01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:07,560
impossible but now that all the content

01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:09,810
will be managed in Drupal well you know

01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,670
with Drupal we can have versions of

01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:16,740
content and we can have a workflow for

01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:19,890
for managing that getting things

01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:23,180
approved or translated so there's

01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:23,180
endless possibilities there

01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,510
I've got actually got a combined

01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,010
question here so do workspaces and the

01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:35,220
API initiative work together

01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:39,840
eg can I specify a workspace from which

01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:43,260
to get my JSON results I don't think it

01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:46,140
works right out of the box but I there's

01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:47,820
at least two companies out there that I

01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,920
know of that are doing some really

01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:54,900
really exciting things with workspaces

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:56,490
and and JSON API so one of the examples

01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,230
I think we need to do a few tweaks in

01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,240
core to make this work you can certainly

01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:03,510
get it working on contrib they imagine

01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,130
you have a JSON API per workspace then

01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:07,800
all of a sudden you have a very capable

01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:11,190
content hub for example where you can

01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:13,950
have you know decoupled sides kind of

01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:18,960
inherit content automatically between

01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:19,410
each other regions countries whatever it

01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,000
might be

01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:24,030
so there's definitely at least two

01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,110
companies out there that I know is using

01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:30,060
it together but it's totally true that

01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,770
today it doesn't yet work in Drupal core

01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:34,910
but the good thing is that workspaces

01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:36,630
has just become stable or is about

01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:39,180
exactly

01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:41,580
and Jason API does have the underlying

01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:44,130
infrastructure to make it possible to do

01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:46,770
negotiates which kind of thing you want

01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,830
so either revision or by workspace and

01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:53,160
so all of the foundations are there it's

01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,810
now workspaces is becoming stable Jason

01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,820
API is already stable so this is like

01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,740
one of the next things to do immediately

01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:01,740
after workspace has become stable so it

01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:03,420
will be added but today it's not

01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,490
possible but I'm glad to hear that some

01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,530
companies already experimenting if you

01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:11,250
want to know more grab me if you see me

01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:13,050
around or we will be able to answer more

01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:16,710
questions or point you to the issue to

01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:24,510
do to work right so so what I heard was

01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:26,250
this week that's what I all right is

01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:30,030
does anyone know if there's an

01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:32,730
initiative to for a module that makes

01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:35,400
use of eloquent does anyone know of if

01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,750
there is such a thing seems like a lazy

01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:43,620
web thing but I thought I'd ask

01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:45,210
okay okay moving on question about

01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:47,070
configuration management so

01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,750
configuration management doesn't export

01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:51,330
files that are linked to configuration

01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:56,000
for the fields for example default

01:05:51,330 --> 01:06:00,840
images will there be a fix in the future

01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:04,970
possibly create an issue target with CMI

01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:08,670
to candidate and then help work on it

01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:12,060
like it sits with all these issues if

01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:14,210
you have a need for it and if if you if

01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:17,460
you're blocked by core not having this

01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:21,450
solution and if you create a patch and

01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:24,210
add tests and then find someone else who

01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:27,720
marks it as reviewed and tested by the

01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,910
community then it will happen and if

01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,430
nobody creates a patch then it's very

01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:34,470
difficult to make it happen but that's

01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:35,790
why we're all here and and you don't

01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,710
necessarily have to create the patch

01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:43,050
yourself but if you create the issue and

01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:46,560
you create like a buzz around it sort of

01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:50,010
like you you create you you make other

01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,870
people know about it and then maybe

01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,820
someone else who doesn't have this need

01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,430
necessarily but knows how to fix it can

01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,680
come in and

01:06:54,430 --> 01:07:00,369
and help so I think that's the best

01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:05,020
solution answered fantastic that's good

01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:07,119
advice for all of the things Christina

01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,710
besides the new admin team is there room

01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,799
for front-end devs to help with

01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:14,589
initiatives sorry actually maybe for

01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:16,809
everyone but bs besides the new admin

01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:18,910
theme is there room for front-end devs

01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:22,119
to help with other initiatives

01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:24,730
I guess front-end apps can also help on

01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:27,069
the new work in theme because basically

01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:31,420
that's what it is

01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:34,529
but yes also the well not really sure

01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:37,839
about where would you start with a

01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:40,240
JavaScript part of the initiative right

01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:43,930
now but for sure there's there's a lot

01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:46,359
of need of front-end developers with

01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:50,700
ideally with some experience on Drupal

01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:55,299
core but not only that so yeah not in

01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:57,309
the workflow initiative we have some UI

01:07:55,299 --> 01:08:00,160
tweaks that we want to do as we head

01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:02,140
into maintenance mode with our

01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,480
initiatives so if your front-end

01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,130
developer do do reach out to me and I'll

01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,510
be able to point it to a couple of

01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:12,700
issues as well I also would like to

01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:15,929
point out that the media library module

01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:18,400
is close to becoming stable and are

01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:19,719
there's a lot of themes out there admin

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,609
teams that are not necessarily in

01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:25,390
corporate also in can trip that could

01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:26,620
have a better styling or apply to it for

01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:31,830
the media library so that's also

01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:31,830
something really narrow scope to work on

01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:36,520
there's a lot of issues in the layout

01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:39,549
builder issue queue that we need

01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:46,569
front-end JavaScript assess work on so I

01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:50,560
call first dibs alright so that's a lot

01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:53,920
of opportunities a question about

01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:58,150
mentoring is there any region or local

01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,940
mentoring for non-english speakers that

01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:04,020
is a good question I think I would

01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:07,390
recommend reaching out in the

01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:18,550
contributor I don't know offhand

01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:21,490
of regional mentoring but in general

01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:23,800
there's more and more local drupal

01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:26,080
associations which would be a great

01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,920
place to start

01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,570
more more mentoring at the local level

01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,150
so if you're looking to start something

01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:36,280
in your region definitely reach out to

01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:44,230
your local Association and talk to them

01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:45,730
about it or start a local association so

01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:46,720
we're still taking questions off of

01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:48,130
Drupal initiatives we've probably only

01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:52,330
got time for one or two more so if you

01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:53,740
still have a question get it in now if

01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:56,140
somebody wants to volunteer maybe one or

01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:58,800
two want a volunteer what the biggest

01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:01,870
challenges are obstacles you faced in

01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:07,150
leading in initiative somebody wants to

01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:09,910
be bold and speak to these things I mean

01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:11,710
I think it's a lot of us is just

01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:14,500
organizing volunteer labor is always a

01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:15,940
challenge people come in and out and so

01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,980
you have to design a process where

01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,230
that's okay and that those small

01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:22,960
contributions can be like a drive-by

01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:27,370
contribution can still be productive in

01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,720
our work it's much more it's sort of

01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:31,330
driven by the energy of the people who

01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,040
are in the room sure of other ones too

01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:34,270
but if somebody wants to work on speaker

01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,840
diversity then that's what gets worked

01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:39,160
on so it's really about cultivating

01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,390
energy and cultivating for us a

01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,340
community so that people do want to

01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:44,200
stick around and continue the work like

01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:48,090
you said guilt doesn't work very well so

01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,090
you want to get people who are excited I

01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:54,550
would say that the biggest challenge we

01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:56,530
had is just coordinating the times you

01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:58,570
know you can't do all of the processes

01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:01,030
of an issue all by yourself you need

01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:03,610
multiple people and if someone goes away

01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:05,770
then that can block an issue and that's

01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:07,570
why it's good to have a plurality of

01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:09,790
people working on things so if someone

01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:12,970
has to go on vacation or have a life or

01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:14,590
something then it you don't have an

01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:16,620
issue that just drags to a halt for a

01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:18,420
week

01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,720
one thing I want to add and I spoke

01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:23,370
about it during during my sloth

01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,950
sustaining an initiative financially

01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:28,200
over a number of years it's also really

01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:31,650
hard not everyone is in a position where

01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,720
they have time or or kind of the ability

01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:36,030
to contribute so you know paying

01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,340
contributors and sustaining people the

01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:41,580
kind of year after year really bring all

01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,040
these issues to completion that's hard

01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:47,250
you know apart from writing very very

01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:50,340
complicated code of course you know

01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:52,560
sustaining that has been has been quite

01:11:50,340 --> 01:12:00,360
a challenge now my session on Wednesday

01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:02,040
and you'll learn more about that are

01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,840
there any plans for Drupal's diversity

01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,690
speaker training to be brought to a

01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,550
wider audience like DrupalCon

01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:09,840
yeah so if you take the workshop

01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:13,200
obviously can take that we're gonna be

01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,850
doing it at triple con Minneapolis and I

01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,920
personally I'm gonna try to do it as

01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:19,680
many times over the next year in many

01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,290
cities as I can so we are definitely

01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:24,930
still working on that and if you're

01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:27,570
interested we would obviously love help

01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:29,700
getting fundraising and that kind of

01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:31,140
thing going cuz Jill's this is her

01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,520
full-time businesses running these so we

01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,780
need to be able to compensate her for

01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:39,170
that alright with that we're gonna

01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,550
conclude the questions part of the day

01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:44,720
