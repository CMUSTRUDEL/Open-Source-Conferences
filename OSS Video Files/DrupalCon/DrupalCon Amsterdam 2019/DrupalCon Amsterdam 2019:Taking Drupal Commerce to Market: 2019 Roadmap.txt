Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019:Taking Drupal Commerce to Market: 2019 Roadmap
Publication date: 2019-10-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Presenter: Ryan Szrama
Description: Drupal Commerce has been in active development since February 2010. We've seen tens of thousands of sites launch with it and process billions of dollars in transactions, including some of the world's most recognizable brands. However, even as the Drupal 8 branch picks up steam (8,000 sites and counting!), it still feels like the project's best days are ahead of it.

At DrupalCon Seattle, Commerce Guys went public with its new brand, Centarro, and a product / marketing roadmap that will lead the broader eCommerce market to give the project a fresh look. Experienced Drupal developers and agencies understand how to get the most out of Drupal Commerce, but because our marketing, products, and services supporting the platform often don't match the language the industry uses, we see room to grow.

This session will cover our efforts to change this, to help teams succeed with Drupal Commerce more broadly by helping them make the case to their clients and / or internal stakeholders that the platform should be considered in even the most demanding environments. Expect to receive a lot of information in a short period of time covering:

* Core framework roadmap through the end of 2019
* Contributed module initiatives (including who's sponsoring them)
* Distribution strategy for Drupal 8 and beyond (e.g. where's Commerce Kickstart?)
* Resetting our posture toward the project as open source software vendors
* Hosting, support, and bundled services strategy comparable to competing platforms
* Observations from third party market analysts we engaged to set our 2019 strategy
* Where and how you should be winning deals with Drupal Commerce now

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
to the presentation on taking Drupal

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,050
commerce to market I have three small

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,300
children at home and we often do little

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,679
piggys you know on the toes where it's

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,059
this little piggy goes to market this

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,619
little piggy stay at home this little

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,130
piggy had roast beef this one had none

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,529
yada yada yada well I never really

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,109
understood like if the pig was going to

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,789
market to be slaughtered or to buy

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,669
groceries to eat no we'll pretend that's

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,910
not a metaphor for anything so I'm

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,309
Ryan's Ramah the CEO of Sentaro and

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,040
creator of Drupal commerce on Drupal 7

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,860
before that I was working on uber cart

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,070
at a restaurant equipment sales company

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,260
in Louisville Kentucky and out of that

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,570
groove you know what we have today as

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,239
Sentaro formerly known as commerce guys

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,579
as drupal commerce led by boyens

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,649
ivanovitch the new platform lead and

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,129
maintainer of Drupal commerce on Drupal

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,600
8 and as we've matured as a company and

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,460
as a project one of the next things

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,790
we've had to consider is what does it

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,610
mean to give voice to our work in a very

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,189
crowded well-funded competitive

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,040
marketplace where we think that what the

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,159
Drupal community has to offer is at

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,650
least as good if not better than what

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,880
the competition has to offer so that's

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,909
what this session will be focused on

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,710
it'll be equal parts roadmap business

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,079
strategy and then just a little bit of

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,659
forecasting where we think Drupal

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,610
Commerce has a future that will provide

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,619
long term sustainability for the project

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,579
one of the things that that we can asked

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,770
a lot at Drupal con Amsterdam before

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,290
this in Seattle is why did you change

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,939
your name what's the deal why was

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,530
commerce guys bad you know it has really

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,090
good name brand recognition in the

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,479
marketplace and all these things that

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm very very well familiar with because

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,829
we do have to make money to live and all

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,659
those contact form submissions like they

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,520
don't know who Santoro is whenever I

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,280
email them back from a commerce guys

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,569
contact but we thought it was very

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,239
important

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,830
once we separated from platform that Sh

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,830
to reset

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,770
our posture toward our project because

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,610
if you think about going out and buying

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,400
software you don't go to a software

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,490
vendor or a small you know team of

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,630
freelancers or whatever and and ask them

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,920
to give you what they have too often

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,450
they say well it's called something else

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,530
and it's part of something else and by

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,450
the way if you do business with us we

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,620
have a different legal entity and we

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,850
have this that and the other three

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,730
websites that you should go to learn

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,650
what it is that we have to offer you

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,750
instead everywhere else in the

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,910
e-commerce ecosystem you go to a vendor

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,230
to learn about a project and find

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,560
somebody to help you build it and it's a

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,630
very clear story somebody is giving an

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,850
authoritative voice to a software

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,800
project or application and they're then

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,110
selling or implementing on behalf of a

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,940
merchant and so this this shift from

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,980
commerce guys to Sentara for us is

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,690
mostly about and resetting our

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,820
relationship toward our project to be

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,459
its open-source software vendor which is

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,860
very common in other areas right we've

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:18,209
all maybe bought a get lab license or

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,200
MongoDB license or whatever it is that

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,970
you know that you may be out there

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,580
purchasing it's a very familiar story

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:27,209
and what we're trying to do is is

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,970
basically bring support planning and

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,680
elevating partners that merchants are

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,050
actually looking for so that they give

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,269
us you know a glance when they go to a

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,130
big trade show or an analyst and try to

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,860
find out what they should be using to

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,060
drive their commerce strategy forward

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,100
and whenever I say well we want to take

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,430
this project to market you might respond

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,230
well isn't it already there aren't there

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,530
already people today building big

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,239
amazing sites small niche sites all

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,840
using Drupal commerce and the answer is

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,910
undeniably yes almost 60,000 merchants

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,370
are using Drupal commerce so that does

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,320
prove that it is in the market I think

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,910
the question is just what do people in

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,560
the market think of it is it just a

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,070
project for hobbyists is it just a WoW

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,709
commerce style thing that you add on to

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,180
a Drupal if you already have a site like

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,549
you would add a route commerce on to a

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,359
WordPress like how do people think about

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:24,000
us is important and I will say that

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,950
commerce to EDX has been growing well

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,050
Boyan recently updated the stats for me

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,970
because I think my last slide until last

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,169
I said this was around 8,000 sites been

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,419
the last month and a half since I've

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,090
used these we've added another 1500 site

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,270
so we're not the 9500 stores running

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,310
Drupal commerce on Drupal 8 for about 50

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,699
thousand stores total according to

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,090
drupal.org processing probably over at

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,650
this point two billion dollars annually

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,780
through Drupal powered online stores

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,490
which is really cool there aren't that

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,159
many projects in the world that achieve

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,470
that kind of scale so I think that what

00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,879
the Drupal community has done and and

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,039
what we've been able to accomplish just

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,750
through this small piece of what makes

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,150
Drupal commerce Drupal commerce is

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,930
really incredible and and other people

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,360
think so as well

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,490
PayPal often you know what will

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,050
reiterate to us that they process a

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,000
tremendous amount of transactions

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,159
through Drupal commerce powered websites

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,710
and they ask us what they can do to help

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,539
us make the platform even better which

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,370
is why they exhibited with us at Drupal

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,259
con Seattle and have been really great

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,389
partners to help us continue growing

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,650
Drupal commerce and please don't mean

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,199
this slide this is such a conference

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,630
faux pas I have half a book up on the

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,340
screen but this will be in the slides so

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,020
you can review later on or use it

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,020
yourself when you're trying to explain

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,120
what is Drupal commerce to prospects or

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,130
merchants that that it is a complete

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,539
framework and this is important because

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,909
I was speaking to the CEO of another

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,650
drupal company recently it was fairly

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,409
new to the community had been brought in

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,779
to help a company grow and and in his

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,879
mind the commerce modules were like

00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,400
maybe a shopping cart in a checkout form

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,870
you know not not an actual holistic

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
ecommerce framework that provides

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,349
everything from product catalog

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,879
management through to shopping cart and

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,289
check-out management and fulfillment

00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,810
order management and on and on

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,279
so the fact that we do offer a complete

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,199
framework is very important to point out

00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,389
because I think that we need at least

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,639
out-of-the-box to be as good as Shopify

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,650
out of the box what makes Shopify really

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,690
special is their massive App Store and

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,460
their million merchants and their you

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,379
know hundred billion dollars in

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,550
transaction volume that drives continued

00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,699
investment in their platform they're

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,099
huge but the core Shopify product is

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,560
actually achievable with Drupal and

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,349
Drupal modules out of the box but we're

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,969
not quite there yet you know for example

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,159
our reporting system still needs to be

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,520
improved or if you think about the

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,289
shipping

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,129
module we were able to partner with the

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:49,349
Danish Agency adapt to develop improved

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,180
shipping module over commerce one that X

00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,590
that included things like packages and

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,139
multiple shipments per order and that

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,729
kind of stuff but we didn't actually

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,979
have the bandwidth at a time to really

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,780
drive it through to completion and so we

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:06,389
hang it around boyens neck like a badge

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:08,280
of shame and just getting by anything so

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,620
we have things like the shipping module

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,090
the recurring framework we're there we

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,370
were able to invest a lot by partnering

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,970
with torch box and we got a really great

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,210
API for managing recurring subscriptions

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,909
and maybe not a really great user

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,130
interface so it's obvious that there are

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,810
things that need to be on a roadmap that

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,880
we need to be planning for collaborating

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,940
with more partners and more agencies to

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,610
produce but the target in mind is just

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,440
like base level out-of-the-box Drupal

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,719
commerce ought to be able to provide the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,129
same base and core feature set as a

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:46,050
Shopify alright fair enough now one of

00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,550
the ways that we get there is by also

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,960
seeking out technology partners who will

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,240
invest in the platform because that's

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,310
happening on these other platforms so

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,039
for example I'm not sure who is familiar

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,199
with Shopify business model there are

00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,819
traditional software as a service they

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,409
obviously charge a monthly fee for their

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,449
core platform than they charge an

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:05,610
exorbitant fee for every plugin you want

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,560
to add to it and then they keep you know

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,990
whatever 30 percent just like Apple of

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,789
whatever that app store sale is and

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,819
that's how they grow you know their

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,069
their App Store revenue but they also

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,800
white label stripe and take a cut of

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,479
every transaction and if you don't use

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Shopify payment gateway well then you

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,270
have to just give them an additional I

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,620
don't know like percent or something of

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,690
every transaction that comes through

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,159
your store I'm sorry so it's it's

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,449
complicated right because you may not

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,029
even know how much you're going to have

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,800
to give or pay Shopify for the pleasure

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,329
of using their service whenever you

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,969
first start your company and they want

00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:40,469
that amount to grow over time even if

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,680
the core value they provide the business

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,690
doesn't actually increase but what makes

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,130
that happen is the help of their friends

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,410
right if they didn't have the stripe

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,270
partnership that revenue opportunity

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,430
wouldn't even be available to them and

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,270
so it's it's harder for us as an

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,250
open-source community to

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,840
to kind of get on their radar to start

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,180
to help them understand how big we are

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,040
how distributed we are in fact one of

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,900
the first things that PayPal asked me

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,450
when we started talking about partnering

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,430
to improve our European feature set

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,590
right so think 3d secured to and strong

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,090
customer authentication they often say

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,190
well can you give us a list of merchants

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,290
and what country are they in and I said

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,000
cool well there's about 50,000 online

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,710
stores using Drupal commerce and I think

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,170
I know about 50 of them will that be

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,000
enough because of course it's open

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,650
source software and there is no email

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,600
wall or pay wall that you have to pass

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,820
through to start building with Drupal

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,850
commerce you just compose your install

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,530
and go you're done so reaching out to

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,150
them and getting them involved and

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,280
helping us grow and contribute to the

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,140
success of Drupal commerce has been huge

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,540
if it weren't for that if it weren't for

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,820
PayPal and authorized.net and avalara

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,070
like whenever we separated from platform

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,510
SH it just wouldn't have worked we

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,000
needed their support they gave it to us

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,920
and now we've been continuing to find

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,050
new and more partners to expand our

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,750
reach expand our audience and it's fun

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,640
to see what happens there additionally

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,260
the pace of core development isn't

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,060
slowing down so thanks to those partners

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,800
thanks to our own professional services

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,480
Boyan is able to work full time on

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,580
Drupal commerce and then the rest of the

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,950
team contributes as well maybe about the

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,260
equivalent of another full-time you know

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,140
person just working on the core commerce

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,490
framework in major contributed modules

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,300
so if you think about recent changes in

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,730
core Commerce 2.14 was released with a

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,370
full address book feature set both on

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,900
the checkout form and user account

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,400
interface but also on the admin

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,830
interface and this is something that

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,210
we've never even had before in commerce

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,340
one that XO it's really cool and you

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,320
should check it out and the next thing

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,330
to come to bear there will be the the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,770
whole like profile copying so my

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,650
shipping is the same as my building or

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,740
vice versa which is complicated stuff so

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:50,140
it's it's it seems like a simple feature

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,820
on a slide like oh yeah we added address

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,230
book support how long could that have

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,990
possibly taken new does anybody want to

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,310
hazard a guess

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,020
no no brave souls

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,400
how many weeks do we think it would take

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:06,770
to add an address book to COI all right

00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,920
one I would love that

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,360
ya know it took us months because when

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,399
you think about what does it mean to

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,390
have a core address book feature what

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,339
can you have to think about well what is

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,380
my data model for customer profiles

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,480
what's an optimal user experience that

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,490
will be rational for most users of the

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,170
software how do we rolled out an upgrade

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,810
path that doesn't suddenly completely

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,209
change the checkout form for 9,500

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,950
people what happens when you can no

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,630
longer uninstall a module because of a

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,339
Drupal core bug like you start to hit

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,250
all these things I think when it was all

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,230
said and done I don't I don't want to

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,640
speak for for bullion he knows the real

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,190
numbers but it took us some months of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,810
development and it's not that we regret

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,480
it but that means that while we were

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,920
investing in retooling and rewriting

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,290
certain parts of our core framework to

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,910
add what seems like a simple feature we

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,220
also did a lot of you know housekeeping

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,959
and refactoring that was essential to

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,820
now continue to build on that success

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,410
and so that's that's why I like

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,940
sometimes it doesn't seem like things

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,110
are happening but really a lot is going

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,850
on to the under the hood and you can

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,800
just read the commit log and see all

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,230
that's changing additionally in commerce

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,170
2.15 will come out in the near future

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,270
and include full core v80 number

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,220
collection and validation against the

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,070
use web service for validating v80

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,680
numbers really cool we already have full

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,140
v80 support in the core framework thanks

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,839
to our tax library which is a standalone

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,690
PHP component that we use in the tax

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,779
module to calculate and and assign v80

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,600
to orders now you also can support the

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:37,610
b2b requirements of tax exemptions and

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,550
this was thanks to the sponsorship of

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,100
our friends at factorial who sponsored

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,510
that work along with the development of

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,520
the Commerce invoice module which

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,620
Jonathan has been working on for the

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,149
last couple of months so these features

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,060
are continuing to make Drupal commerce

00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:55,399
more capable in more markets right if

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,800
you don't have robust invoice generation

00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,839
that are you know immutable invoices

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,100
with a tightly managed workflow and

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,630
you're not duplicating them and the

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,670
numbers your generator properly all that

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,670
stuff then you actually can't even use

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,070
it in Germany for b2b transactions and

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,950
so that's important to start to expand

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,660
our reach into more markets but also

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,779
just to you know continue to improve the

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,800
core feature set as well other things

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,779
that are happening or all of our core

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,089
you know our core maintained payment and

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,790
gateways from technology partners like

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,620
authorize.net and stripe and PayPal they

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,690
all had to be updated to support strong

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,670
customer authentication and which I'm

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,490
sure if you've been managing you know

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,019
ecommerce sites in Europe you're

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,790
probably well aware of the pain of

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,860
having to make sure everything is

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,510
up-to-date for 3d secure to and nothing

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,050
goes down whenever the you know the

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,740
switch flips and the site stays online

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,140
finally we're partnering with other

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,060
agencies like new media who want to kind

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,829
of take on ownership of the commerce

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,230
reports module so it's more capable

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,899
out-of-the-box the best we were able to

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,850
accomplish with the time that we had was

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,649
introducing what we would call like a

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,120
denormalization engine into the module

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,010
that lets you take a transaction and

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,839
create one big record of everything

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,480
about that transaction so you can create

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,370
better database queries to generate

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,470
reports because our experience in the

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,779
past was using views to do all of that

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,339
on the side we just tanked a site as

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,709
soon as you had any sort of appreciable

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,930
scale on the website that was just an

00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,270
unusable solution so we got commerce

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,279
reports again to the API completion

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,200
phase and now new media is partnering

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,480
with us to bring the user interface to

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,860
bear all right so lots of things are

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,420
still happening and I'm sure I'm missing

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,120
things but you can come by the booth and

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,399
Boyan can fill you in so it's not

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,959
slowing down and one of the things

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
that's very exciting to us is that

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,040
thanks to the drupal 9 strategy which

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,870
you've heard reese talk about you've

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,200
read about on drupal planets you've seen

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,130
in the documentation Drupal 9 will just

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,300
be Drupal 8

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:57,510
- deprecated API xand features right so

00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,000
the the leap from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,480
is not significant in fact Drupal

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Commerce is today Drupal 9 ready there

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,010
we don't use deprecated functions Bowen

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,899
is very good about chasing updates -

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,510
core to make sure that our framework is

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,250
is always you know getting rid of those

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,019
deprecation notices as soon as possible

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,519
and I think was it Mike Lutz who

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,920
contributed a significant amount of his

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,990
own time to also help make sure that the

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,050
module package was ready for Drupal 9

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,970
what this means is that we don't have to

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,790
pause everything we're doing for another

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,560
three years to rewrite it all again so

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,720
from uber cart the Drupal commerce on

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,610
Drupal 7 was a complete rewrite it took

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,319
years to accomplish and then Drupal

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,180
eight comes out and guess what we had to

00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,069
put all of our forward progress on hold

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,800
again for another three years to rewrite

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,720
everything an object-oriented PHP for

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,569
Drupal 8 and so we started that

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,519
initiative I think it was in 2014 we had

00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,980
a sprint in our office in Paris and then

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,990
it was at Drupal con not doubling that

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,389
Dublin we had a beta and then at Vienna

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,209
we finally had the full release so it

00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,649
took us a full three years where all of

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,540
our competitors were continuing to

00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,879
actually expand their future set grow

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,029
their partnerships present a better

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,860
marketing message to the market and so

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,410
like for me that's like just super

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,730
exciting that that as a company we

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,939
actually can continue to think about

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,769
forward progress and new development and

00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:21,720
new features and new partnerships and

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:24,360
not have to go back and think okay well

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,870
how would I rebuild all of this again

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,339
with a different paradigm and that's I

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,819
mean that's soul-crushing work

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:35,370
Boyan used to be six feet tall he's just

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:38,779
kidding all right

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:41,279
so yes Drupal Commerce is in the market

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,470
but it's complicated right so we are

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,649
there we have a great story we have had

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,050
great success but it's complicated

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:52,319
because if you go to an analyst if you

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,509
go to a trade show that's just not in

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:57,689
the Drupal community and start talking

00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:59,730
about Drupal commerce I think we've been

00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:02,519
asked before is that like it is Drupal

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,890
like is that a medication or you are you

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,720
are you building websites for medicines

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,030
and for other random things I said no no

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,350
this is this is ecommerce software well

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,679
it's just not even part of the

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:16,319
conversation or people think oh I used

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,970
to Drupal before for a blog or I had a

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,789
horrible experience with Drupal before

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,260
on Drupal 5 whatever and so they don't

00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,839
even they don't even like they're

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,000
compelled by Drupal commerce in the same

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,860
way that a lifelong Drupal developer

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,539
would be I think wow this is great I

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,370
have a complete framework to do build

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,409
any kind of e-commerce site I want with

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,690
Drupal because I already love Drupal and

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:39,450
it's been my entire career but for

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,740
people that aren't there with us it's

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,289
not even a part of the conversation so

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,460
providing ecommerce for Drupal users

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,830
right if that's the goal that

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,290
that's still a niche that's a very small

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,910
chunk of the market again I talked about

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,690
the numbers that Shopify has recently

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,550
earlier over a million stores over 100

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,170
billion dollars in annual transactions

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,490
passing through their system and they

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,750
actually know them all right because you

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,520
have to give them a credit card in an

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,380
email address and so they're able to

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,720
continue to grow their platform solicit

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,160
feedback from their users understand how

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,230
to improve their feature set provide

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,600
great support all these things that were

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,130
handicapped at um

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,230
additionally software strategies just

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,080
how do you do ecommerce continue to

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,520
multiply so rich Joneses session

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,470
yesterday from Enrica was all about

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,180
evaluating the ways that just one

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,560
company implements the e-commerce and

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,390
they had like five different strategies

00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,460
that they use whether it's just a full

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,440
stack Drupal or a full stack Magento

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,180
whether it's pairing up Drupal with

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,260
Magento or Drupal plus big commerce

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,330
whether it's using a different

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,040
technology entirely I think they have

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,920
one or two silliest projects in their

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,330
portfolio like these things like all the

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,610
strategies are multiplying based on

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,490
merchants requirements and so on and we

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:54,390
do want to understand and communicate

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,770
where is Drupal best used and we want to

00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,050
actually get that message out to a

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,600
market where proprietary vendors and big

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,730
sassman there's dominate the press so we

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,190
went to IRC II the last couple of years

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:09,000
this is the Internet Retailer convention

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:12,360
and Expo in Chicago Illinois and it's a

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,070
massive massive tradeshow like it's just

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,560
it's hard to even communicate like just

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,740
hundreds of vendors in this massive city

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,960
block wide convention hall and and we

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,640
had like our 10 feet behind this really

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,890
big pillar that completely obscured us

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,250
from view here I felt really good about

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:32,250
that sponsorship but but being there

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,160
it's just incredible to see just how

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,500
well other companies are able to execute

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,320
their marketing message because they

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,940
have a single authoritative voice

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,530
focused on pushing that forward so it's

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,960
about it's about roadmap it's about use

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,820
cases it's about strategies and that's

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,310
something that we know that we have to

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,260
be able to provide better for Drupal

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,630
commerce I really saw that then Drupal

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,910
agencies have that kind of authoritative

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,620
voice behind them that helps them go and

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,300
convince merchants then to trust them

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,140
not just with their e-commerce software

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,210
but also with

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,280
digital strategy centered around that

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,170
e-commerce software and everything else

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,690
that you do to help make an e-commerce

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,940
company a success finally I'll just

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,560
point out that headless Commerce which

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,300
of course is a big part of our roadmap

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,260
and and I think a lot of Drupal's

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,750
strategy is a trending but still a far

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,070
from settled market so some of these

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,230
companies on the screen like they won't

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,300
even be here in five years some of them

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,010
just raised 150 million dollars to

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,490
continue pursuing a headless Commerce

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,570
strategy you know so what we have to

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,450
think about is what is it that

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,970
privileges Drupal Commerce over against

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,370
an elastic path is it flexibility is it

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,770
license and community what is it that

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,530
privileges us over a commerce tools is

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,180
it the fact that we are tied into a CMS

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,570
and can warehouse both content and

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,220
product data in the same back-end what

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,500
is it exactly that that gives us that

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,110
that leg up on the competition we're

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,540
thinking about these things and we have

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,340
a plan to get where we want to be so of

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,020
course we know that the only way to eat

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,480
it all in elephant is one bite at a time

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,570
or please don't eat elephants in real

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,910
life which we want to get down a long

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,850
road and reach a long destination then

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,930
we have to just think one step at a time

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,940
what is it that's gonna get us where we

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,410
want to be obviously we have to continue

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,210
to close gaps with our nearest

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,620
competitors I already mentioned that

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,810
it's what I call like the Shopify

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,340
baseline or you might consider if you're

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,320
just working in content editing

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,540
initiatives we often refer back to the

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,130
WordPress baseline we have to be able to

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,510
offer at least a media library

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,970
out-of-the-box right if we want to

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,340
compete with WordPress for the content

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,600
editing experience well same again for

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,610
the commerce experience we have to be

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,130
able at least do what they might be able

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,410
to offer on the checkout form or on the

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,570
product page or whatever so we're

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,680
focused on closing gaps and the main way

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,690
that we've been able to do that as a

00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,820
company is through customer funded

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,100
development and so we actually put Matt

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,380
smart into the splash Awards this year

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,470
because they're a great case study of a

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,510
company that not only adopted Drupal

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,030
commerce in-house and built what they

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,300
built themselves but then they grew it

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,950
to a massive scale that we rarely hear

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,900
of in Drupal commerce right over over

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,310
tens of millions of dollars in annual

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,930
online sales

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,280
small dollar value transactions right

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,110
you don't you don't buy a thousand

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,210
dollars or groceries at a time most

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:24,330
people unless you're buying just a

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,950
tremendous amount of bacon I suppose so

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,180
they have their thousands of orders an

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,310
hour perhaps that are coming through

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,410
this system Drupal Commerce handles it

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,210
all but the way that it handles by going

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,180
fully headless and getting Drupal's

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,470
rendering API informs API and the

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,080
bloated form cash out of the

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,540
conversation we started to create for

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,940
them direct JavaScript components that

00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,620
plugged into Drupal commerce resources

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,330
on the backend and now that they've

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,850
arrived where they are and continue to

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,750
think about opening in new markets

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,670
increasing their sales volume in their

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,950
existing markets one of the things that

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,450
they're very happy to do is generously

00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,730
give back to the Drupal community

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,430
because they know they've got so much

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,710
from Drupal they want to be sharing back

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,230
with the rest of us and with the rest of

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,610
you their API resources or you know the

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,190
rest resources that power they're back

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,990
in the API they're their improvements to

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,260
the cloner check out integration their

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,580
improvements to bringing store overrides

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,830
to the framework this is a recent

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,630
feature where if you have a multi store

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,030
site you can actually override

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:27,090
individual product or product variation

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,190
fields on a per store basis right so on

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,560
my finish site versus my Swedish site

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,270
maybe it's a different image or a

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,800
different price or whatever that's

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,230
that's that's a new feature that we've

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,990
just developed all of us they're giving

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,760
back and so that that lets us put

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,710
multiple people from our core team on

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,930
improving the feature set and closing

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,550
those gaps so we really value people

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,640
like matt smart we're very appreciative

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,440
of their contribution to drupal on end

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,650
they were recognized by the splash

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,300
awards you know as a model worth

00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,420
following and we want to see more matt

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,580
smarts right so very very appreciative

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,680
of them and then the next step was to

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,690
bring you know close those future gaps

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,760
and then just help people find the

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,220
answers they need when they have

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,500
questions because one of the things

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,660
that's that's almost distressing for us

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,470
as core maintainer of the module is to

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,440
hear that a large user has stopped using

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,960
Drupal commerce because they couldn't

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,389
make it scale they couldn't get a

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,889
feature to work or whatever

00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,329
and we know that if they just talked to

00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:32,519
us we could have solved their problem in

00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:33,929
15 minutes or less and then that's not

00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,149
even an exaggeration I have specific

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:38,009
yeast cases in mind where we came in

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:39,839
after the decision was already made to

00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,179
reap lat form I will go Drupal 8 in

00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,519
Magento because that's what you know

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,719
consultant told me to do and we say well

00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:47,879
you know you didn't have to do that at

00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:50,129
all if you would have just changed one

00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:51,599
setting in here my sequel database all

00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:53,700
of your lock wait timeout errors would

00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,159
have gone away right so not to be too

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,889
specific and to not like it hangings

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,749
over my head like the one that got away

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:01,889
so we don't want that story to happen

00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,200
again right and we also don't want

00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:06,479
people to be afraid to touch Drupal

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,849
commerce because they're concerned they

00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:11,459
may not be able to find support like

00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,619
we're there but sometimes a slack

00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:16,469
channel isn't enough also a slack

00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,029
channel disappears every week so there

00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:19,769
is no history there's no benefit from

00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:21,599
long term you know question-and-answer

00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,729
generation and so that's that's of

00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,399
course the message at the booth for this

00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:28,440
show which was the launch of centaur

00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,149
support but it's not just enough to talk

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,149
about support we also have to be talking

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,799
about roadmap if you're in the process

00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,690
of trying to convince somebody to use

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,820
Drupal commerce you have to be able to

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,799
tell them what's coming next or if they

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,389
need a feature you have to be able to

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,269
tell them when they can expect that to

00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:46,709
arrive if it's in development or if

00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:48,450
they're going to have to expect to

00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:51,179
invest and developing it if it doesn't

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,889
exist yet and so we know that roadmaps

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,659
not a dirty word but it's not something

00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:56,969
that's that's easy in an open-source

00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,859
environment to develop and project and

00:25:56,969 --> 00:26:01,950
commit to and attain and so on and so

00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,239
forth so to date we've had an issue in

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,219
the issue queue that Boyan keeps

00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:06,570
up-to-date with initiatives and with

00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:08,489
things that are coming down the pipe but

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,809
but we have to do better than this

00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:12,659
because that's not something you can

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:14,549
ever show to potential customer you can

00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,799
say oh yeah there's a great roadmap here

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:19,919
look it's in this issue queue and Drupal

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,440
no that's D RUP okay and you know what

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,389
that's not talking about so we know we

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,369
have to be better than this but in order

00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,499
to do that one we have to actually have

00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,909
time to step back and plan and then we

00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,799
have to have somebody whose job it is

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:34,200
just to make sure that this is being

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,419
coordinated so that when new media are

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,579
dropped solid or factorial or 1x

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,259
internet or whomever it is comes to the

00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,950
table to join us in advance in the

00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,390
project

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,940
they know how to get plugged in and

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,920
that's why we've been working closely

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,350
with our friends at circle web foundry

00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,730
over the course of the last year and are

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,670
now arrived at a point we'll they'll be

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:56,700
joining us in two Santara to help drive

00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,770
forward things like road maps so me Mia

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,290
from their team will become the product

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,870
manager for Drupal commerce helping

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,310
Boyan prioritize and deliver various

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,750
features according to a schedule in a

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,110
way that we haven't been able to in the

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,820
past Yvonne from their team is a great

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,290
front-end developer and is responsible

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,540
for the belgrade themes they'll continue

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,430
to improve the belgrade theme that we

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,930
use as our mom I thought I had it

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,570
that's not get too far ahead of myself

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,940
that we use as the current Drupal

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,190
commerce demo so being able to produce

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,230
things that make it easier for you to

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,360
show off what Drupal can do just with a

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,610
quick demo site or for merchants that

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,620
want to start themselves and grow like a

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,180
Matt smart to have a better starting

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,790
point is very important to the success

00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,760
and growth of the project additionally

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,320
as a company we're not stepping back

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,760
from any sort of free support channel

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,890
and we still are very active in Drupal

00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,840
slack but again very sad to see that

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,910
every time a question gets answered as

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,980
soon as Drupal slack hits it's 10,000

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,230
message limit that knowledge goes away

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,360
forever so we've been in work begun

00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,700
working with Stack Overflow to create a

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,200
private Stack Overflow team where we can

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,450
start to collect all of the joopa

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,400
commerce related questions and put a

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,530
financial model behind it so that we can

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,690
afford to put people dedicated on

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,400
answering questions in a guaranteed

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,800
fashion right and you have to be able to

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,080
take that to a merchant and say look if

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,660
you do adopt this piece of software not

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,680
only can I just go hop into an IRC room

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,870
and find an answer

00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,180
mamie but I also can trust that the

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,130
vendor if I'm unable to find the answer

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,360
myself will directly give me that answer

00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,070
so this is the message we're trying to

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,200
help people bring to the market and I'm

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,910
hearing even from from agency owners

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,800
here at Drupal con that that's actually

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,280
important to winning new business and

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,020
the lack of that kind of infrastructure

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,660
behind the project has been a liability

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,850
so we're closing that gap as much as we

00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:50,520
are closing feature gaps finally we're

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:55,160
focused on easing new user evaluation

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,160
and onboarding excuse me

00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:02,649
has anybody tried to install Drupal

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:06,760
commerce for Drupal 8 has anybody failed

00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:09,940
at doing that I have and you know I

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,919
shouldn't but it's it's not it's it's a

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,360
it requires a different mindset right

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,159
you have to start to learn a new set of

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,320
tools you have to understand what it

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,120
means to use composer and then you have

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,460
to understand what it means to deploy a

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,470
composer develop project into a web

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,210
environment and manage it there it's a

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,320
different paradigm there's a lot to

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,059
learn and a lot of different moving

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,529
pieces that sometimes I don't actually

00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,419
know what composers are doing on the

00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:33,039
command line and then I just get spit

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:35,110
out an error message another guy that's

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,570
that's cute

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:41,889
and so the question is what can we do

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:43,539
and to ease new user evaluation in a new

00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:47,100
environment where the classic

00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:48,940
distribution model no longer applies

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,250
people are building interpolate

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,529
distributions but our model for commerce

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,690
kickstart 2 dot X isn't the right model

00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:57,370
for Drupal 8 a demo store that's

00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,320
somewhat inflexible and hard to work

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,570
with in production that that's kind of a

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,279
waste of our resources and and in fact I

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,649
mean it took us at the time almost a

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,049
million dollars of investments in 2012

00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:10,360
through 2014 to develop what became

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:12,220
commerce kickstart and that was just a

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,250
commerce guys project done to elevate

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,630
the the presence of Drupal commerce in

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,909
the market because it looks like an

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,500
e-commerce application but at the end of

00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:22,179
the day it created liabilities it

00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,250
created technical debt and things that

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:26,320
that didn't make it ideal but we've

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,360
learned from and now used to improve the

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,880
core of Drupal commerce itself on Drupal

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,440
8 and so with the new model we're able

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,690
actually to create a project template

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,580
and composer so with one command line

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,220
you can do composer create project and

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,409
it's a Drupal commerce demo and it just

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,529
installs and I mean if using something

00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,820
like Dee dev on your local machine for

00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,039
development environments it's literally

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,630
like 2 command line commands and you

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,799
suddenly have your local machine turned

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:56,440
into a full Drupal commerce demo that

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,409
looks like Belgrade this is online at

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,730
dinners kickstart calm right now but

00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:03,460
also if you just want to give it a whirl

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,950
and have an actual admin login we've

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,900
partnered with simply test dot me the

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,060
testing web interface

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,590
Drupal modules to get a little Drupal

00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,480
commerce demo button down there in the

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,940
corner and with one click that will also

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,950
install the entire Belgrade based demo

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,570
and give you a full admin login so you

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,190
can actually go into a pitch and say hey

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,540
let's you want to see what's behind the

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,310
scenes in Drupal commerce cool let's

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,530
let's check it out you click the button

00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,570
a minute later you have an environment

00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,180
that's hosted on tugboat thanks to

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,160
lullaby that lets you log into it as an

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,960
administrator and show them everything

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,790
that Drupal Commerce has to offer out of

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,620
the box it's really cool and it really

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,510
changes the game for for what it looks

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,460
like to begin to help people understand

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,460
and evaluate and Drupal Commerce

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,380
additionally we know that not everybody

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,940
out there wants to adopt Drupal commerce

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,340
themselves right there's still plenty of

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,260
people in that hole unaddressed segments

00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,390
of the e-commerce industry that just

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,880
want to pay somebody money to get the

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,460
thing this is why people pay Shopify

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,410
plus $2,000 a month just to get their

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,510
foot in the door and then thousands of

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,950
dollars more a month to load it down

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,540
with apps that will make it do what they

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,540
wanted to do sorry

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,580
and so our vision for where we see

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:24,549
Sentara growing with Drupal Commerce and

00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,320
bringing sustainable long-term revenues

00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:28,750
to the projects we continue to develop

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,660
it and and promote it and grow the

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,720
project is to pursue this sort of idea

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,940
of a managed headless Commerce instance

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,470
right so Drupal Commerce as a service

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,390
there's a few steps we have to take to

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,280
get there first but the idea is that by

00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,320
starting with just continuing to develop

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,210
Drupal Commerce and adding a small

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,970
support model around it we're able to

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,700
monetize our expertise as module

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,260
developers and our experience and to

00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,360
take that money to then just continue to

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,910
reinvest in growing the platform for

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,559
everybody that's great I mean just a

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,270
small percentage of Drupal commerce

00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,040
users coming to us for commercial

00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:06,340
support completely changes the nature of

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,230
our company it adds multiple boyens to

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,390
the project and and what he's been able

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,309
to accomplish alone is amazing but if we

00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,049
had five people like him working with a

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,299
product manager like menial behind them

00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:18,130
all that the scale of our development

00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,900
would would be incredible and you've

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,030
seen that happen in core initiators like

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,590
layout builder media library what it

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,780
looks like when you get multiple people

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,580
working on the same thing with some sort

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,440
of sustainable financial model behind it

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,179
bigger things can happen and that's what

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,919
we want to do when we think about our

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,929
technology partnerships and adding like

00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,850
a Sentara cloud for hosting Drupal

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,380
commerce in a managed environment then

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,690
we're talking about monetizing what

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,940
merchants are already buying to build

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,669
the product so in other words nobody has

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,520
to pay PayPal more to use the to use

00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:50,799
PayPal on Drupal commerce but because

00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,720
those people are using PayPal PayPal is

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,630
happy to invest in the continued growth

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,100
of Drupal commerce so it doesn't cost

00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,140
the end-user any more it actually

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,270
doesn't cost you as an agency anything

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,190
to include something like that into a

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,290
pitch but by virtue of using those tools

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,929
or if we're able to create like a

00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,550
Sentara cloud with a hosting partner by

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:11,560
virtue of using those things you pay no

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,210
more but you are contributing

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,639
financially to the continued development

00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,909
of the project and then finally our sort

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,440
of Holy Grail when we think about

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,720
reproducing Matt smart case studies and

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,090
having more managed headless commerce

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,159
instances that drive development to the

00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,260
product that's kind of monetizing our

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,370
vision which is thinking about what it

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,320
looks like to have an actual

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,780
open-source software as a service

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,150
headless Commerce server in the market

00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,250
something that's still purchasable but

00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,130
also customizable something that's

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,320
usable just as a REST API but also still

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,030
drupal behind the scenes if you need to

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,780
add an additional repository to your

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:53,520
instance one of the things that that's

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,520
all shoot lost the thought never mind

00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,900
it's gone

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,640
oh I got it back one of the things that

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,730
I often think about when we look at

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,530
Drupal usage statistics is it's easy to

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,500
look at the usage statistics and think

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:11,110
wow there's still like 700,000 Drupal 7

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,850
sites and despite Drupal 8 being out for

00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,250
years now there's only half as many

00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,200
Drupal 8 sites and that causes some

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,110
people concern because they think that

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,520
the Drupal whatever that is is shrinking

00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,800
when in reality what's happening is

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,930
people that are on Drupal 7 and they're

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,640
just running small sites blogs brochures

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,680
whatever they don't have a reason to

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,480
upgrade to Drupal 8 and if they do

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,520
upgrade they're looking at it as a

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,140
completely platforming because Drupal 8

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,820
is completely different from Drupal 7

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,260
and at that point considering well

00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,150
should I just be on a hosted service

00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,520
should I be going to Squarespace or Wix

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,160
or WordPress comm or whatever it is

00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,110
right so those users probably aren't

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,670
coming back okay we have to think we

00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,770
have to acknowledge that and think about

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,510
what it means to have higher value

00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,280
projects but fewer of them it's a

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,690
different kind of community but one

00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,570
thing that I see happening is that

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,320
future Drupal users will never touch

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,960
Drupal at all right future Drupal users

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,120
will interact with Drupal as an API

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,400
server but they'll be JavaScript

00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,320
developers and front-end developers who

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,330
are used to just consuming rest api's

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,920
and don't really care what's under the

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,080
hood but they'll be benefiting from what

00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,030
we're all doing as Drupal developers and

00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,020
the Drupal community and so that's who

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,120
we're thinking of when we think about

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,310
who's the person that's going to buy a

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,140
fully managed headless commerce server

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,330
well it's it's it's an organization that

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,100
manages hundreds of websites and wants

00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,410
to put direct consumer e-commerce on

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,600
each one of them but thinks it would be

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:37,990
crazy to take a hundred rupal sites and

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:40,360
suddenly add an additional like highest

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,700
security conscious set of modules to

00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,700
them and try to manage 100 individual

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,250
e-commerce website

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,140
instead that can have one headless

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,180
santaro commerce server if you will and

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,950
then connect each one of their existing

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,140
Drupal sites or non Drupal sites to it

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,300
over an API and again this is the exact

00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,400
same model that Matt smart uses they use

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,240
react on the front-end it's a completely

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,950
standalone react application powering

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,320
Matt smart not SC and Matt smart not Fi

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:08,330
and a react native app powering their

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,000
mobile like that that's the model that

00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,530
we see really finding purchase you know

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,700
in the market in the future that's what

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,030
we're pursuing and that we think will

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,500
drive the you know the long-term

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,300
sustainable development of the project

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,490
forward so if you're interested in that

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,930
vision contributing to it learning more

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,760
about it please stop by the booth we'd

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,080
love to talk to you about it or anything

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,840
that we've talked about in this

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,990
presentation and last but not least

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,070
would have say but why even talk about

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,930
monetization because we're here to think

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,490
about open source and code and so on and

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,970
and the simple answer is just that

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:44,030
getting to market takes money and and we

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,770
want the project to last for the long

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,700
haul we want to be able to keep doing

00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,140
what we're doing because we enjoy our

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,150
jobs and we enjoy one another and we

00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,950
enjoy the community but in order to keep

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,300
doing that we do have to be thinking

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,400
about this at least and it's not your

00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,570
job to solve that for us as a company or

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,430
as a project but this is what we're

00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,660
thinking and we do think there's

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,880
opportunities in here to partner with

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,330
all of you to make it happen and for all

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,830
of us to benefit from the result that's

00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,270
all I have to say about taking Drupal

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,900
commerce to market thank you for joining

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:14,010
us

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,300
[Applause]

00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,740
and I'm told by this monitor that we

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,570
have a minute and a half I'm happy to

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,920
field questions but they must be

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:33,000
questions that are ansible in less than

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:35,230
a minute and a half little hot potato

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,520
that's fine I probably talked to a lot

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,720
of you already in the booth we'll be

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,960
happy to see you there thanks again for

00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,960
