Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: Linux Server Deep Dives
Publication date: 2019-10-29

Acquia, Arlington, United States

Over the past few years the Linux kernel has gained features that allow us to learn more about what's really happening on our servers and the applications that run on them.

This talk will explore how these new features, particularly perf_events and ebpf, enable us to answer questions about what a Drupal site is doing in real time beyond what the standard logs, server performance tools, and even strace will reveal. Attendees will be provided a brief introduction to example uses of these tools to diagnose performance problems.

This talk is intended for attendees that are familiar with Linux, the command line, and have used host observability tools in the past (top, netstat, etc).
