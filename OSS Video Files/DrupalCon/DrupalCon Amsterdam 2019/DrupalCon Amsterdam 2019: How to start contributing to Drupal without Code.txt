Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019: How to start contributing to Drupal without Code
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Paul Johnson
CTI Digital, Macclesfield, United Kingdom

Not all of us are destined or even want an illustrious role as in core or contributed module developer. I don’t even know how to roll a patch and by now I’d be dangerous in git. If you've ever struggled to find a way to contribute this IS the session for you.

It is a common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. Historically open source projects have neglected non code contributions. “You’ll do the project a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!”

My passion has always been in non code contributions and I want to help those of you who have yet to find your outlet, or want to get more involved.

This session will be a bountiful selection of impactful ways you can start to contribute to Drupal outside of the code, sourced from community members across the globe and in all manner of interest areas, many you may have yet to realise.

What you'll gain from attending
By the time this session is done, hopefully I will have inspired you and identified specific people and places to go to start your contrib journey!

Who is the target audience?
If you occupy any of the following roles or have skill sets in these areas the content I've prepared will be particularly pertinent and valuable.

Customer (end user of Drupal) - Product owner, Content Manager, Site owner, Evaluators, CTO, CMO
Agency - Founders, owners, managers, sales and marketing
Promoter - Copywriter, marketing, SEO, social media
Creative - Business analysts, UX Designer, Visual Designer, Content Strategist, Translator
Facilitator - Project Manager PM, Manager / agency owner, (Events / conference organiser), Mentor
Connector - Trainer, HR, sales person, Recruiter (yes you can contribute too!)

well here's me thinking that everyone

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,750
was here to see the security for the

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,309
Empress II think and you're not so

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,700
delighted to see how many people have

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,099
turned up actually my first presented

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,039
this at jeepers camp London and it was a

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,789
similarly large number of people

00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:23,580
attending that so here we go so my name

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,220
is Paul Johnson I'm a director at Seton

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,900
digital we work with a lot of membership

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,260
based organizations charities and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,870
government through to higher education

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,190
building people websites but actually

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,290
that's not what I'm here today to talk

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,420
about if you have any questions

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,879
afterwards I'm very active on Twitter

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm PD Johnson there and on Drupal to

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,750
hawk you can also email me I'd love to

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,250
talk more about it afterwards so first

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,620
of all I'd like to talk about my

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,230
personal contribution journey that

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,829
started back in 2011 at Drupal con

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,340
London

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,559
I like maybe you are were eager to get

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,470
involved but I didn't really quite know

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,049
what my place was I was no longer a

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,110
developer and I kind of took me a while

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,869
to find my place and hopefully by the

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,380
end of this session maybe you will find

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,619
yours too so my passion Falls well

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,030
outside the the code I'll have to

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,259
capture the moment

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,119
telling people story through the lens I

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:30,170
can often be found in the contribution

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,700
room a Drupal event but I'm not coding

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,790
I'm editing photographs I might be

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,210
writing a blog post or driving through

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,850
people's social media so you might say I

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,920
mean impostor it seems I'm amongst

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,450
friends as well they because there's

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,979
much more to this thing called ripple

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,979
down the kodaline

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,830
so what are we going to live in a

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,799
session so I want to explain why

00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,210
contribution without code is so valuable

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,330
the motivations that you might have to

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,030
contribute why working together is

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,970
better the way you can go to find places

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,989
to contribute and how to get started and

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,930
you are no better place than the

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,200
DrupalCon to do that so according to

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,440
open source guide our website a common

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,480
misconception about contribution into

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,080
open source is that you contribute code

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,280
align maybe that's because open source

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,730
is source as in kite and maybe this is

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,620
subconscious think and historically open

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,040
source projects have neglected non code

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,920
contributions but you'll be doing the

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,590
Drupal project a huge favor by offering

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,069
to pitch in with these types of non code

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,260
contributions and for a long time the GV

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,670
project has recognized the importance of

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,350
these kinds of contributions indeed

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,709
trace has said fostering the Drupal

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,739
community is actually more important

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,350
than managing the codebase itself so the

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:05,329
man at the top thinks is a good idea so

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:07,459
why do people contribute well often

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,070
people say that it proves their existing

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,420
skills they get to meet new people who

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,230
may be interested in the same thing as

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,959
then maybe they want their mentors and

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,030
they want to help teach others it also

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,519
helps you to build public artifacts that

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,410
can help to grow your reputation and map

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,489
to your career further maybe employers

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,829
will see them with the outputs that

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,420
you've produced and we can see that with

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,549
the celebration of things like a pitch

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,100
deck in the session that was just on in

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,590
the main stage by definition all your

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,750
open-source activity is public which

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,370
means you get free examples of what

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,200
you're good at

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,519
you could also learn people skills so

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,299
open-source offers lots of opportunities

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,739
to practice leadership and management

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,920
such as resolving conflicts even

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,910
organizing teams of people maybe even

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,910
prioritizing work

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,110
so we do have an excellent mechanism to

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,990
track contributions and historically

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,560
it's been used to track code but also we

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:13,230
can now track non code contributions say

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,690
lots of events like Drupal Camp London

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,459
that my local unconference in Manchester

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,930
they have issue queues where you can go

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,600
and comment and say I spoke at this

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,820
event and you get recognition on

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,530
drupal.org that you've made a non code

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,870
contribution and there are more and more

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,120
people doing this now so all the

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,130
speakers at this event will benefit from

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,370
this mechanism and that's really good

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,200
for growing your visibility and also

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,270
your employer gets recognized so it

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,550
actually has an effect positive effect

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,180
on your employer so that they start to

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,350
become more visible on the on drupal.org

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:53,050
in the marketplace but personally I'm

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,180
more fuelled by the the the human side

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,000
of things just a kick that I get if

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,560
someone says that yeah they've achieved

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,720
something because of something I've done

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,340
or they've liked something I did or I

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,600
just seeing somebody grow as an

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,210
individual it's really powerful so I

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,490
asked Twitter and why members of the

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,790
Drupal community contribute and this is

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,100
what they said so I've done a benjamin

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,870
over in australia she spends nearly all

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,490
of their time trying to persuade people

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,830
to contribute and she feels like it's a

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,580
virtuous cycle and the more that you

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,260
pretend the more you get back as well

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,510
there Paul Raoul who helps to organize

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,040
do become London wanted to put something

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,260
back into the community that helped him

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,040
when he was younger and now he's one of

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,740
the leading forces in jury of London and

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,630
then we've got Baris he always felt it

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,160
was just fair to do something for all

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,710
the knowledge that he's got out of the

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,270
Drupal project and he's been responsible

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:54,480
for her helping to organize the blue

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,910
spot she was happening tonight

00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:01,810
and then you've got struck with some of

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,150
these names well that's he talks he's an

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,340
owner of a business but he likes to know

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,590
that his team has started to learn

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,930
faster by working with other people

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,520
who've got common goals and interests

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,130
there are people who have gone before

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,979
him and his team we're not learning

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,970
things twice and then you've got kissed

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,950
and over in the USA

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,600
she likes to support people that are

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,479
doing a lot more than her so she often

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,190
works as a facilitator there not a super

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,729
valuable contribution so she's working

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:33,039
in things like the contribution sprints

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,600
so hopefully you can see something where

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,370
she resonates with you from your

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,440
perspective so but I also hear a lot of

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,990
people saying well there's something

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,060
that's holding me back so I'm

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,650
intimidated and I don't know where to

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,729
start

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,140
that's the fair thing to say because

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,240
when you get to Drupal dog it's not even

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,340
entirely there most welcome in place and

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,740
Rachel who's taking photographs at the

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,300
moment is actually working on a project

00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,979
which will mention later about how we

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,650
can improve that experience and you can

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,520
be a key part of that this week so there

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,070
are plenty of people in our community

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,680
Kathy was on mentioned on stage earlier

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:11,680
and she's an awesome individual she's

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,860
one of the mentors and she gets a real

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,860
kick out of helping people to start

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,080
their contribution journey so perhaps go

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,270
and have a look on slack for people like

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,460
heard there is a contribution rim in

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:29,050
slack and don't worry about big groups

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,760
there are lots of intimate ways in which

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,960
you can just you know one-to-one or in

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,430
small groups that you can participate

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,610
yeah it doesn't have to be one of these

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:41,680
big showy activities I don't have enough

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,750
time to contribute well Suzanne Yoshi

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,669
recognizes that every small contribution

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,200
helps and there are lots of ways to

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,479
provide valuable input which doesn't

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,550
involve a lot of time so even just

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,410
providing your opinion on something is

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,510
really valuable or even just sharing on

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,510
social media is a contribution to g4

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,580
because we're getting the word out there

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,970
and there's a really good place to go

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,580
I'll show you slides afterwards but

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,250
this dis no don draper dog has got tons

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,460
of 30-minute tasks and it is divided

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,720
into lots of different disciplines so I

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,650
defy you to find something that you

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,150
wouldn't wouldn't save you I'm new to

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,509
Drupal and I've got nothing valuable to

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:24,000
offer oh you do as a new community

00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:26,220
member you are new uniquely placed to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,240
offer a fresh perspective a new set of

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,390
eyes in your opinion or to review user

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,349
experiences or even wording that we use

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,890
your knowledge is really valuable

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,950
because you come with that open mind and

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,640
new perspectives particularly in the

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,620
usability of our system so that were

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,529
really good to see you start doing some

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:54,120
work that so there's every reason why

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,529
you should get involved and I also want

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,540
to mention that contribution is better

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:02,010
together Afrin Smith github stated the

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,839
open source in body is a model for

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,510
people to work together building

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,020
something greater than they can create

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,860
on their own and so it's the benefit of

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,250
many eyes and this chap and doctor bear

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,740
noted Belbin did some research proved

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,930
that working together whether died

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,360
people with a diverse mix of behaviors

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,160
is possibly the best way to operate and

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,810
I just want to quickly skim through his

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,260
model the Belby model which has been

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,450
around for a long time he saw that there

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,910
are nine different archetypes and you're

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,650
likely to be a combination of some of

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,820
them and each one has strengths

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,709
allowable weaknesses which is very

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,180
interesting to me and don't be surprised

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:49,529
if this person does so every single

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,300
person has something they're really good

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,160
at but then maybe something they're not

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,410
good at and if you put two people that

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,120
have got the strengths in the areas

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,760
where someone's got weaknesses you start

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,990
to get something very very powerful so

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
these are quite dense pieces of

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,459
information and I recommend that you go

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,560
and have a look afterwards but perhaps

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,140
if you skim through these you can start

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,870
to see in these descriptors some of your

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,230
own personal traits so the resource

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,230
investigator is it has

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,960
positive nature finds ideas and brings

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,540
them back the team worker helps the team

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,220
to gel the coordinator focuses the team

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,520
on objectives and delegates work

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,860
appropriately well very different

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,870
personalities here the plant uses their

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,270
inquisitive nature to find ideas and

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,850
bring them back and you've got the

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,720
monastery evaluate who's got a logical I

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,980
making impartial judgments and so on so

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,530
we've got the shaper who provides

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,860
necessary drive to ensure that the team

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,050
keeps moving the implementer needed to

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,530
plan a workable strategy and carry out

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,330
things that efficiently as possible what

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,390
I suggest you do is I found a really

00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:01,660
good self evaluation tool so there's a

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,330
bitly shortcut there and try it yourself

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,980
and you might find out that you're

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,210
slightly different to who you thought

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,790
you were and knowing about the Belva

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:16,060
models really helpful and remembering it

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,100
about yeah how you might what sort of

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,290
teams you might seek to go and join or

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,090
maybe and you can see an opportunity

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,490
where there's a team that has not got

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,310
the skills that you possess and also

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,380
forgive yourself the things that you're

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,330
not so good at it's actually archived in

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,570
common there's nothing wrong with you at

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,690
all and if you do that success should

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,370
fine so now it's time to get specific I

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,620
set up I would send you away with some

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,010
things that you can do this week or in

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,140
the future and so I want to start you on

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,320
your non code contribution so I've

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,240
broken it out into my own different

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,530
groups I've got customers hopefully

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,300
maybe we've got some end users Drupal

00:11:53,530 --> 00:12:00,130
here maybe agency leaders promoters

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,600
creative people facilitators and

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,940
connectors so here we go so first of all

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,730
there's a great place to go to on

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,040
drupal.org duple slash contribute

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,920
there's a whole load of ideas that might

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,000
get you started but that's just driving

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,910
so a customer he might not be so

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,320
apparent as to what you could do perhaps

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,019
you're a product owner or a project

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,610
manager

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,790
or a concert manager or an owner

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,410
themselves so case studies are a really

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,929
valuable way to contribute to Drupal

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,420
because it grows this body of evidence

00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:37,040
that ripples being used in lots of

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,589
different areas so there may be another

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,439
organization that you are similar to

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:44,480
that would like to benefit from Drupal

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,489
but digitally these reassurances from

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,319
someone else like them so we work with a

00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:50,600
lot of unity universities and they tend

00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,420
to be quite tribal in the way they work

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,889
it's not really helpful

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,889
make your users available to researchers

00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,540
so we're looking to make dramatic

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:03,410
improvements in the way that Drupal is

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,799
works in the backend so that people can

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,660
be more efficient and so people who

00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,829
managing content that would be a great

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,170
way to to help so Suzanne who was on

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:19,399
stage earlier developing web has got a

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,649
blog about that you can get involved why

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,769
don't you speak to other organizations

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,799
like you in the UK we have an

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:29,779
organization called open charity where a

00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,970
lot of the nonprofits and charities

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,389
actually come together a bit like Drupal

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,189
con but in a small scale and they

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:40,999
sharing ideas and maybe you could do

00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:44,959
that in your sector as well also engage

00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:48,470
with promote Drupal and so that's been

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,189
driven mostly by agencies so we really

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,799
like to have your participation there

00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:56,480
also organisations take you safer if

00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,160
you're in an agency or you're an

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,110
organisation yourselves it's actually

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,449
very surprising how few organizations

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,249
have registered on drupal.org now this

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:06,619
is really useful for you to grow your

00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:11,419
reputation or your clients reputation

00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:13,999
and add its it might end up where

00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:17,509
there's a collaboration on you working

00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:19,879
on something really difficult to solve

00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:22,339
or it could be a way of you surfacing

00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,040
yourselves to make yourself known that

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,529
you have Drupal requirements for staff

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,879
and you may lead to leader up to speaker

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,160
opportunities that events like this as

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,449
well so being visible laundry of dogs

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,040
really important some of these

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,590
organizations are the ones in the UK

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,550
dive cherry-picked

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:42,070
that used rifle also how about providing

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,500
some financial support to maybe the

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,529
Drupal Association so you can have a

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,380
membership based a member organization

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,270
organization or you could become a

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,120
supporting partner to go that little

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,580
extra so that helps with things like and

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,770
making sure the Drupal dogs there and

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,300
other events like this happen and it can

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,600
be from as little as thirty dollars a

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,950
year or why don't you speak at an event

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,560
like this there's nothing more

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,710
interesting than either an agency or a

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,980
client speaking at an event and we start

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:18,550
to we'll all grow together it's a

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,400
virtuous cycle okay so we've got

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,740
founders managers and salespeople are

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,089
agencies sales people you might be

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,610
surprised can actually make a

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,440
contribution to Drupal so educate your

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,470
clients about open source and the Drupal

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,380
Association support your staff in their

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,070
attendant events like this Lobby or

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,020
staff to attend meetups and maybe speak

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,240
as an agency leader I find it incredibly

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,710
frustrating that my staff don't want to

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,770
do that willingly sometimes we have to

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,450
persuade them and give them time to

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,190
contribute back it does give you better

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,980
visibility in the marketplace on

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,710
drupal.org and I can say not just

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,570
anecdotally but in actual fact that we

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,450
actually have a client in the room today

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:05,830
that was discovered us through and

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,450
reborg and make sure that you are

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:12,910
registered on Drupal planet so there's a

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:15,940
really vibrant writing ethos in Drupal

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,160
and there is a syndication tool on

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,780
Drupal tool called planet you can

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,339
register your agency or your

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,839
organization on there to go out to a

00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,820
very large audience each time you

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,950
publish a blog post so it's a really

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,810
good thing and we'll say we've already

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,640
there's a new area called agency

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,370
marketing on Drupada org you should take

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,339
a look at that and maybe make your

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,260
office space available to meetups and

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,920
maybe the global sprints there's some

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,600
happening I think in February and enter

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,829
the splash awards day actually happening

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,989
tonight but that's

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,959
there's some more coming up at the next

00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:54,999
gerbilcorn which are global awards I

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,629
definitely would check them out and

00:16:54,999 --> 00:17:01,209
submit a case study to the pitch deck

00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:04,089
why not self your organization or your

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:07,059
agency it'll all about raising your

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,520
profile Jordan met and over in America

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,020
he works for Palantir and he says that

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,789
the increase with ability of status

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,809
within the community which this

00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:20,220
generates health drive sales and also

00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:23,049
retain or recruit front

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,260
furthermore the leadership of an

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:29,500
organization attend chief executive

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,110
officers meetings and summits brilliant

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,179
from most transfer there's a CEO dinner

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:40,840
tomorrow evening that's being organized

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:44,770
by one shoot and Danny Cali olia XO

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,590
vague yes and also participate in survey

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,289
so there is a state of Drupal annual

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,779
survey and is also the CEO survey they

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,179
all help to crawl to run better

00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:56,860
businesses so there's no end of

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,779
opportunities here which may not be a

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,950
mmediately apparent when you go on to

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:05,649
Drupal dork so ya caught Brock wits is

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,840
in charge of the web form module and

00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:09,429
he's talking about something which is

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,010
similar to the issue that we were

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,970
talking about the privacy where

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,010
evaluators often wonder whether things

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,919
are supported and where can I go for

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,559
help well there are fundraising

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,289
initiatives to help ensure that there is

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,500
that support through open collective and

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:32,950
here's one of them this session today

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,570
has been recorded and it's Kevin bull is

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,149
involved in that he was here this

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,520
morning setting it up and he's had a

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,770
decrepit slide he recorded a thousands

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,720
sessions by January when I first did

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,440
this session now it's 2000 they're all

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,070
on YouTube

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,000
massive library of learning materials

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,250
can't do it with a little bit without a

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,680
bit support okay over to the promoter so

00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,730
this is a really powerful blog that I

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,790
read by Sara watch a butcher I really

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,060
can't say her name and it was some title

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,470
don't feel like an expert share anyway

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,570
basically what she's saying is there is

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,280
no magical amount of experience that

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,770
will suddenly make you worthy of sharing

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,670
your ideas to the world do it anyway and

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:22,270
I kind of live that mindset and yeah

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,770
writing is a really great way of getting

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,810
more ideas in from other people and

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:32,650
opinions but also just you know making

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,030
an idea better write about your

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,310
experiences intrigue or create

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,200
conversations and debate write tutorials

00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:41,290
about a project edit and create

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,780
documentation you don't need to ask for

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:47,110
permission to go and edit documentation

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,840
just go for it write tutorials about the

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,620
project and how it can be used and then

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,440
is a good offer and promote really again

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,850
creatives so the write at a user

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,400
experience design and a visual design

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,490
and the content strategy expert and even

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,320
the translator so Christina the trim

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,780
lass was on stage and her team are

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,330
developing the new theme for the admin

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,790
of Drupal Clara I spoke to her this

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,310
morning if you go into slack and look at

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,350
the admin UI that channel and the admin

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,940
UI design channel there's plenty of

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,860
conversations going on oh I should

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,100
welcome some more support from creative

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,340
designers if you've got UX skills

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,880
there's a usability issue key which I've

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,550
linked here and the accessibility team

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,560
are always looking for help and it's

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,840
lacking in most areas testing user

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,890
experience UI changes and there's no

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,920
coding required whatsoever and this is

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,270
where you need to go and start and

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,160
there's an if you cue there so you can

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,980
go in it for us to start off with the

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,530
issues if you go by status of needs

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,630
review that would be a really low bar

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,270
for you to start your experience there

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,070
in fact I've just got a screenshot here

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,480
this is exactly what you do to fill the

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,700
needs of news review is just basically

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,570
the final stage before something can

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:14,150
be committed and there's also guidelines

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:16,830
here so there are issue queues for

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,600
content so you can go and read

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,309
applications for companies to be listed

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,610
on drupal.org there are case studies as

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,990
well and and all you need to do is go

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,450
and look at the issue follow the

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,679
guidelines it's a self-guided thing and

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,789
it takes about ten or fifteen minutes

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,470
but you're making a real difference

00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,110
because there's actually a backlog of

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:37,320
case studies which need approved Andre

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,570
pod org and it makes sure that the the

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,370
marketplaces is still up to date and

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:48,990
relevant and baddest idea basically we

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,520
need a lot more people to do that and

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,770
also translations that are two areas

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,419
where you can start to contribute if

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,809
you're multilingual we'd love to have

00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,450
you work in localized reporter or dares

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:03,150
a mechanism there to provide skills

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,690
there and also there's a bar for birds

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:09,390
of a feather conversation on Tuesday

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,919
tomorrow where I can actually help you

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,380
to start participating in the

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,419
translation movement of the pitch deck

00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,409
we absolutely got sixteen languages at

00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,780
the moment and they just seem to be

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,960
growing so this whole like global

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,690
initiative going on right now and also

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,929
documentation is important it's a huge

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,030
barrier to entry for new people and so

00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,770
you may be new to the project but you're

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:36,539
just perfectly placed to be able to

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:38,970
review the documentation so there's a

00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,970
bit link here where there's a project

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,700
that's been run by Rachel to improve the

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:47,520
first-time contributor experience and

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,350
also in your documentation so if you can

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,510
speak to Rachel afterwards or go and

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,970
speak to Matthew about cliff and that

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:57,530
would be wonderful at a facilitator so

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,590
we're nearly there

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:03,919
we've got educators project managers

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,929
agency owners events organizers mentors

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,830
these are people that can help to have

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:14,040
this to achieve their potential so

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,470
Shannon Vettes talks about how Drupal

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,659
actually changed her complete career

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,720
path she started on really

00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,489
small projects just as a beginner and

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,570
she had a really warm welcome to the

00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,779
core team

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,099
she would never excelled in a career to

00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,099
the level experienced yesterday without

00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:35,429
the experience that she's had and she's

00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:39,029
absolutely dying to welcome you as well

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,409
so and she can be found here and she has

00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:41,609
an open invite if there's any project

00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,769
managers out there who want to start

00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,559
getting involved in helping with Drupal

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,759
project and do reach out to it I think

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,309
she's probably here at the conference

00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:55,349
today and and also as the proverb says

00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:57,570
it takes a village to raise a child it

00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:01,499
takes a community to raise a healthy

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:04,259
open-source project last year's Drupal

00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:06,239
Europe this was the embodiment of that

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,429
forty people volunteering their skills

00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:10,919
all essential to the smooth running of

00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,529
the event most of them were non code

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,999
contributions so these are the mentors

00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:20,399
the contribution event that happens this

00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:23,519
Thursday a lot of these people will be

00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:26,549
here again and there is a table for

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,659
promote rupal already and for this but

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,779
there will be lots of opportunities for

00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:32,609
non code contributions and jibril camps

00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,970
and Drupal events really can't happen

00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:37,440
without people like you and making them

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,210
run smoothly developers are not

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,999
particularly good at organizing things

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,119
say and I think there's a lot of people

00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:48,869
in the room who probably are and also

00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,639
just an informal way and you are the

00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:51,979
types of people perhaps project managers

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:56,070
pm's

00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:58,019
agency owners managers who are really

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,919
good at helping other people to succeed

00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:03,989
and so there's you can facilitate very

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,019
beneficial conversations lots of

00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:08,639
activities are happening finally we've

00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:11,039
got the connector so the sales person

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:14,369
the recruiter yes you can contribute to

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,919
your social butterfly you are great at

00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:19,830
work in the room speaking to people

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,529
listening to their story maybe finding

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,389
other people who are like like them you

00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,299
have a hugely valuable role to play as

00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:30,239
an introducer not necessarily at the

00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,970
same event and over time you're bound to

00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,320
meet people

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,950
share common interests and in doing so

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,059
you are contributing to a fundamental

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,110
fundamentally to open source working

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:41,440
together so just to wrap up this week at

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,039
Drupa

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,120
con Amsterdam we have the first time

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:53,200
contribute to workshops part one and two

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,460
on Tuesday in G 109 at 10:30 and that

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,929
would be a really great place to be

00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,929
loads of people there to help onboard

00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,669
you and and to find ways in which you

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,830
can start to get involved

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,780
does it provide people table in the

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,909
diamond lounge all week hopefully

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,559
they'll be somebody's up there to have a

00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:11,620
chat with you could even be myself or

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,600
Rachel and we also have the mentor

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,360
contribution on Thursday and you Roper

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,070
for you too so that's a room which is

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,450
hopefully not too scary for someone

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,789
who's never contributed before to be

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,780
loads of people there who will welcome

00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:31,000
you friendly faces and then there's a

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:33,640
pitch tape off on Tuesday and that's it

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
so to wrap it up non-code contribution

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,980
is of equal importance to code team

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,159
collaboration leads to high performance

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,140
teams

00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,480
non-code contribution takes many forms
