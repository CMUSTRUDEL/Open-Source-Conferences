Vetting, selecting and implementing enterprise IT solutions can be a daunting task; but it doesn’t have to be! With the right planning, research, and methodology, you and your organization can explore strange new worlds--from Drupal to hosting to your own corporate procurement process--with composure and confidence. In this session, we’ll discuss a practical approach that ensures you’ll find the right tech, at the right time, for the right budget, and boldly go where your IT org has never gone before.

Topics include:

- Requirements analysis

- Identifying and working within constraints

- Market research

- Technical bake-offs

- Vendor selection and management

- Implementation planning

- Support and maintenance

um Oh yep I got it

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,379
my name is Jordan Harrison I am a

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,110
program manager with aqueous

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,690
professional services what that means is

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,849
I help clients build and execute really

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,590
big projects in Drupal from Discovery 3

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,180
to launch some the captain of the

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,550
project ship and make sure we don't

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,769
crash we're here today to talk about

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,170
selecting good fit technical solutions

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,670
for the enterprise so particularly if

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,349
you've been tasked with leading or

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,820
participating in a big purchase like

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,309
this and you don't know where to start

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,960
this talk is for you but I've seen this

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,550
process from both sides

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,219
prior to aqueous I spent most of my

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,469
career on internal teams as a senior

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,750
technical and program lead that was

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,329
mostly in higher ed I've implemented

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,239
many many CMS's but also things like

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,340
Enterprise CRMs search appliances all

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,870
kinds of cool stuff what that means is I

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,090
have made all the mistakes so you don't

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,770
have to and this is a really short

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,420
presentation we'd love to cover so there

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,980
won't be a formal QA as part of the

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,329
session but please come find me after I

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,730
would love to hear your use case and

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,110
answer any questions you have you also

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,150
don't need to know a lot about Star Trek

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,470
to understand this presentation but if

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,000
you want to talk about how awesome Star

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,659
Trek is you can come talk to me after

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,430
about that too so diving right in how do

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,290
we select great IP solutions for the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,970
enterprise it's gonna start with

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,799
requirements analysis that's our flight

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,659
plan right what is the problem we're

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,430
trying to solve we're gonna follow that

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,900
up with market research there's a whole

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,790
universe of options out there depending

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,920
on what you want to buy so how do we

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,270
choose then we're to talk a little bit

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,770
about technical bake-offs

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,720
that's how you get your engineering deck

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,759
involved we're going to go through

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,140
vendor selection and management in case

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,549
you need to supplement your crew and

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,990
then we're going to talk a little bit

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,670
about implementation and support

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,229
planning because somebody has to build

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,450
the starship when somebody has to fly it

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,100
so including the humans in your process

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,740
from the beginning is the way that you

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,180
ensure success there's a lot more to say

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,040
about all these topics but there's a

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,799
very high-level overview just to get you

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,110
thinking and get you started so cooking

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,479
it off with requirements analysis what

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,369
are we trying to buy here and why I left

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,200
this Spock quote because it's efficient

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,610
fax always do invite danger and that's

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,090
never more true than when you're buying

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,319
giant enterprise IT solutions

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,090
requirements analysis is going to get

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,500
you the fax you need and it's going to

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,420
serve as the basis for literally

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,710
every other step of your project so if

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,890
you do nothing else that I talked about

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,960
today do this well so what is

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,390
requirements analysis it's a flight plan

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,040
for the entire project where you want to

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,500
start is you want to analyze your

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,180
current state so that's how our various

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,370
groups across the enterprise working

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,930
today what's our current solution you

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,720
want to look at software but you also

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,310
want to look at business processes what

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,690
does the current solution do that we

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,800
want to keep like it's very likely that

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,840
you have a current solution that you

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,030
don't completely hate right what are we

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,230
gonna hold back and keep from that then

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,680
you're gonna want to think about the

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,000
current the best ideal future state how

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,400
do various groups across the enterprise

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,470
we want to be working and what's not so

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,640
great about our current solution you

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,430
want to be sure you understand your

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,010
constraints what can't we change even if

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,440
we want to this might be budget it might

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,530
be security policy might be platform or

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,670
license all kinds of things but don't

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,910
waste time on things that you can't

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,910
change

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,170
the answers to these questions are going

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:21,110
to draw define the path for your entire

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:23,360
project excuse me so since we're Drupal

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,610
conference we'll take a CMS replacement

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,830
as an example here hypothetical CMS

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,200
replacement maybe you have a current CMS

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,140
and it handles images really well and

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,030
it's easy for IT to maintain and it has

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,710
personalization tools that marketers

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,960
like although they want to do more and

00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,280
we want to keep all that because it's a

00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,940
key part of how different groups are

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,220
using the CMS but maybe our current CMS

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,250
admin interface isn't so good it's slow

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,080
to load supports getting a lot of calls

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,850
so we need the editing interface to be

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,670
better in the new system so people can

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,740
work efficiently and then our leadership

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,760
might like a certain proprietary CMS but

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,420
maybe it cost three times our budget

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,770
that's a constraint so you have all

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,150
these questions right things you need to

00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,360
know how are you going to know these

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,360
things

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,390
if you don't know the answers talk to

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,130
somebody that does right identify your

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,140
different stakeholders that might be

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,450
your leadership your IT your business

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,580
your product or marketing folks for

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,070
purchase like a CMS lots of people care

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,870
about lots of different things right and

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,120
they may not agree and that's okay we're

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,860
gonna work on consensus next you want to

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,690
talk to them this means a lot of

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,310
meetings and meeting a lot of new people

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,840
it's gonna you're gonna learn a lot

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,550
about your organization that you may not

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,020
already know then you're gonna write

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,120
down what they tell you and create a

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,230
list of everything everybody wants this

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,030
new thing to do

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:45,890
you're gonna constantly update this list

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,540
as these conversations evolve so how do

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,530
you document what people want right when

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,570
people want all these different things

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,580
and maybe they don't agree you start

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,960
with a spreadsheet simple as that

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,610
you're gonna list your requirements

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,290
you're gonna list your stakeholders and

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,820
then you're gonna have each group rank

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,370
each requirement how do you rank them I

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,050
personally like a method called Moscow

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,180
Moscow is a really quick clear way to

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,890
determine priority and help different

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,140
stakeholders clarify their thinking

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,240
about what is important there's four

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,670
scores here there's your M scores which

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,740
are your must-haves if a solution can't

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,540
perform one of these it's not to be

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,550
considered as far as that stakeholder

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,280
group is concerned then you can have

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,750
your S ranks which are your should haves

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,220
that's ideal functionality these are

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,230
things people really really want in

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,360
terms of stakeholders but maybe not a

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,090
complete showstopper if there's other

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,350
considerations then you can have your C

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,600
rankings which is your could haves

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,940
that's nice to haves they're completely

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,920
negotiable right then there's long haves

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,770
and these are things not to be

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,270
considered in this face these are good

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,480
to write down because it clarifies

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,250
expectations with your stakeholders you

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,890
have each group of stakeholders assign a

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,540
moscow score to each requirement from

00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,690
their perspective so what does that look

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,570
like well it can kind of look like this

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,550
no I personally like to assign numeric

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,130
values to each ranking because it lets

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,310
you generate generate an average across

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,290
all stakeholder groups right so say you

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,790
assign your must-haves a three your

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,120
should have their to your could haves

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,070
are one in your one pass or a zero

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,370
you're going to list the rank for each

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,630
stakeholder and

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,090
and then average them across it's as

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,710
simple as that right the average Moscow

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,169
score gives a sense of the overall

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,760
priorities for the entire enterprise so

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,650
this is really really important

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,710
information um

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,000
so looking at this example

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,860
personalization tools are not that

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,690
important to IT but they're fairly

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,220
important to product here and they're

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,720
really critical to marketing

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,610
that's a real-world example right by the

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,020
end of this process the overall

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,210
priorities should be reviewed and signed

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,950
off by signed off by all these

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,470
stakeholder groups so one thing you

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,479
don't want to do is go talk to these

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,190
people generate an average and then go

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,280
buy something you want to check what the

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,490
averages are back with those stakeholder

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,490
groups

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,310
pardon

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:15,140
so lastly above and beyond these

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,330
must-haves you're gonna need a few

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,430
non-negotiables right so in this example

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,530
IT can't function without patch

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,260
management right so you're gonna want to

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,090
make sure that IT regardless of how the

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,980
average comes out gets patch management

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,330
right that's just a gimme and every

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,700
group is going to have one or two of

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:36,170
these that are non-negotiable so now we

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,150
know what our solution needs to do how

00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,890
do we find a solution of bits you can

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,010
use market research and you can use gap

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,470
analysis so you can use logic to justify

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,300
almost anything that's a great quote

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,280
from Captain Janeway and then addendum

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,830
by me because market research is great

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,510
it's a helpful tool but it requires more

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,270
than just reading a couple reports right

00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:01,340
it's about becoming an educated consumer

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,840
on behalf of your organization so when

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,910
you begin this kind of research and IT

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,950
products you're gonna hear a lot about

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,660
Gartner and Forrester what our Gartner

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,460
and Forrester there are two major

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,230
research companies which analyze all

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,480
kinds of IT products right everything

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,520
under the Sun the reports are quite

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,110
expensive if you work for a big company

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,080
you might have a subscription already a

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,390
pace to ask and it's a good start to see

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,910
what's available but they may not offer

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,430
the complete picture their research is

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,620
centered around the top like 10% or so

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,660
of corporate IT departments so if that's

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,010
your organization that's great but it's

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,790
not your org you probably need

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,400
additional information

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,070
so do your own research right it's the

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,690
same as buying car house you have to ask

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,160
your stakeholders for recommendations

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,380
right pro or con they're gonna have

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,610
opinions you're talking to them anyway

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,920
you want to talk to peers in your

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,780
industry you want to read blog posts and

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,750
articles and analyses and become your

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,670
own expert and then if this is all

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,550
overwhelming which it might be you can

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,800
hire an expert that's perfectly okay so

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,320
for an example from a previous role I

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,510
was in prior to Acquia we were doing a

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,590
CMS replacement a lot of people in this

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,140
room probably worked on something like

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,480
that I didn't know the market really

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,950
well at the time so I started with the

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,810
gardener and Forester reports to see

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,300
what was out there I did a lot of

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,900
googling Google is your friend a lot of

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,150
reading and then I went to an IT

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,370
Roundtable for my industry and the

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,660
reality for my industry just wasn't

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,490
reflected in the Gartner and Forrester

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,160
reports because they weren't looking at

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,100
the industry I was in right so I talked

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,920
to my peers and then I hired an outside

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,900
consultant to come back with like 10 ish

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,450
options based on some baseline

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,070
constraints so that's stuff like hosting

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:51,070
costs average developer per hour costs

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,750
licensing cost stuff like that and it's

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,460
an example one solution we looked at

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,080
looked great functionally but the

00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,060
license was five times our budget so

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,000
that's easy to eliminate that option out

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,710
of the box right we also had the

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,180
consultant look at key requirements so

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,430
he checked the candidates against like

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,960
the top 30% of our functional

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,780
requirements that's like our must-have

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,020
requirements so we went easily from 10

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,180
to 5 options there so now you have 5

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,330
options right so where do you do what do

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,400
you do from there well you can do you

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,800
can narrow this down to about two using

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,270
some gap analysis there's a lot you can

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,700
read about to have analysis as a

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,450
discipline but at a very high level

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,430
you're gonna take the what the

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,930
requirements say you need and then

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,760
you're gonna look at what each potential

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,440
solution does and if there's a gap

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,170
between the two you're gonna think about

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,660
how you mitigate that gap so mitigations

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,420
are stuff like we need to train the team

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,240
on a new technology we need to staff up

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,010
maybe there's a systems integration with

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,499
another system we need to look at stuff

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,059
like that so what you're doing this

00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,249
analysis you're gonna consider how

00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,869
willing or unwilling you are to take the

00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:59,619
mitigations you'd need to take to close

00:10:55,869 --> 00:11:01,899
that gap so solutions that have no gaps

00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:03,309
or solutions that have small gaps that

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,249
were really willing and able to mitigate

00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,379
are going to be our best solutions so

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:15,929
from here you should be able to narrow

00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:18,789
it down to about two top solutions so

00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:20,619
next up in the process we know what we

00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,209
need the solution to do we know what the

00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:24,279
products what product might be a good

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,839
fit for what we need to do now is the

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,699
time to bring in our technical teams and

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,919
confirm all of our previous assumptions

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,289
answer any remaining technical questions

00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,449
and make a recommendation for the best

00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,799
fit solution right and one way to do

00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,569
that is a proof-of-concept

00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,499
exercise called a bake-off there's lots

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:40,059
of different versions of

00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,859
proof-of-concept with technical teams I

00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,229
happen to like this one

00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:46,989
but before we get into how to do a

00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:49,779
bake-off I want to say don't buy IT in a

00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:51,069
vacuum sales engineers will come and

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,199
talk to you about various products

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,819
and/or how they implement those products

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:56,829
and they only show you what they want

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:00,039
you to see because it's their job write

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,809
your own IT folks know a lot about how a

00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,049
potential solution needs to function in

00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,099
your organization so including IT or

00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,649
technical teams in the vetting process

00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:10,959
helps confirm all the assumptions we've

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,849
made to this point and I don't want you

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,649
to hear this as you should wait until

00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:15,849
this point to include your technical

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,379
teams just shouldn't they should be in

00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:19,299
your stakeholder groups they should be

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,729
advising it along the way but this is

00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:23,859
hands-on technical proof-of-concept work

00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:25,899
and the findings here should be

00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:27,489
confirmatory rather than revelatory you

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,319
shouldn't expect any huge surprises at

00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,939
this stage but if there are surprises

00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:34,449
lurking you want your technical team to

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:37,029
find them now so how do we do this

00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:39,039
bake-off thing anyway structure is

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,079
really important your technical teams

00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,909
are probably super busy and you can't

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,679
ask them to just go try out this new

00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,909
thing and get back to you because it's

00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,139
not gonna give you the information you

00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:49,389
need and it's gonna stress them out

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,599
right so you want to go into a bake-off

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:54,219
with two options more is really too many

00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:55,719
you want to provide structured technical

00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:57,459
questions for the bake-off to answer

00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,989
these are often gonna be based on your

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,720
requirements right areas where you need

00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:03,099
to dig deeper clear time and your team

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,560
schedule you probably can't have them

00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,839
stop

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,269
for a sprint or two for this but carve

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,009
out you know hours in the day hours in a

00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:13,339
week that they can dedicate to this work

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,870
without distraction you can apply some

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,629
good project management principles right

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,980
you're gonna check in often a lot of

00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:21,319
times devs will come up with questions

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,730
any vendors to answer have a PM handy

00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:24,410
that can go get those answers don't make

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,829
the devs chase you know sales guys or

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,389
sales engineers you want to review and

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,699
document the team's recommendation

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:33,620
what's the top choice and why and then

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,120
update your requirements if needed you

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,779
may find things that end up being new

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,459
requirements along the way and then one

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,620
last note make sure your big offers also

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,269
have weight there's really nothing worse

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,220
than putting a really smart team through

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,050
this process and having leadership

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,430
coming later and say now we're buying

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,300
this other thing you never heard of so

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,430
thanks anyway

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,329
make sure that that what they come back

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,740
to you with is meaningful so hopefully

00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,149
you're down to one great option now

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,699
you're gonna buy in from your technical

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,120
folks but now you know you need help and

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,889
it's time to hire vendors that's me this

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,420
is not a Star Trek quote but it deserves

00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,360
a double facepalm because I heard it a

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,620
lot when I worked in internal teams

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,600
don't assume vendors can work without

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,970
management any more than employees can

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,769
vendor management is a job and it takes

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,870
time to do well and vendors can be

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,019
amazing but good partnership is always

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,459
needed so first of all you want to

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,829
decide exactly what you want your

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:30,350
vendors to be doing is it research is it

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:32,899
implementation unclear goals and lack of

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,389
direction and cost you money Gary you

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,009
want to ask really hard questions you

00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,970
want to call references some people

00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,189
don't always call the corporate

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,629
references that they ask for you want to

00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:43,040
talk to your peers who are they using

00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:45,410
whoever they had great experiences with

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,660
or maybe not good vendors should be able

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,120
to stand up to scrutiny and bad vendors

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,550
assume you won't exercise it go to

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,170
conferences or DrupalCon right who's

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,449
speaking who do they work for do you

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,980
like what they have to say and good

00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:00,499
vendors often have a process or a

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,449
methodology usually it saves us time but

00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,759
you you need to understand where your

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:08,050
specific organization might need to

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,550
deviate from vendors policy or process

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,959
and what the implications of that might

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,879
be maybe it's gonna slow you down a

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,920
little bit maybe that's okay but it's

00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,350
good to know that up front

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,030
now unfortunately the best consultants

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,140
are not Betazoids Betazoids can read

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,550
minds so since I failed mind-reading 101

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,380
once you've selected a partner remember

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,660
but like I said vendor management is a

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,090
job expect to spend as much time

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,190
managing a vendor as you would an

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,140
employee you're gonna often need less

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,880
effort but you'll never need no effort

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,430
so if you aim high you're gonna have the

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,930
time you need to do this properly you're

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,510
gonna want to define work clearly and

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,530
communicate early and often adhere to

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,090
the process you agree upon upfront right

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,500
know who your key decision-maker is and

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,270
make sure that your vendor knows that

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,520
too don't let them chase answers cuz

00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,170
again that's gonna cost you money be

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,570
fair be kind of be human this applies in

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:05,250
all things and expect all of the above

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,810
and return right so at this point you

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,800
might if you're part of an order that

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,270
does RFPs

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,340
you might be thinking to yourself when

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,870
do we RFP right let's request for

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,360
proposals part of the competitive bid

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:20,220
process and a lot of organizations have

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,780
to RFP right well maybe not how many

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,020
times you've seen a really broadly

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,510
defined RFP process result in a bad fit

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,980
purchase I've seen a lot I'd like to

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,760
think I never led an effort like that

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,220
that's probably not true so big wide big

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,170
broad rfp's don't necessarily work is a

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,090
topic for another talk but they rarely

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,100
do what we want them to do which is get

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,340
us the absolute best fit solution for

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,170
our particular organization and use case

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,810
but many times RFPs are competitive bid

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,930
processes are required so maybe we land

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,210
here right we rethink the RFP process as

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,250
your policy allows in the research or

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,690
bake-off phases ask your top vendors for

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,300
demos right because you and your

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,040
technical team are educated consumers

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,310
now and you can ask really hard

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,230
questions be tough be prepared for demos

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,700
forces sales engineers to go off-book

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,670
it's going to tell you a lot about their

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,190
flexibility right and in a vendor

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,320
selection phase solicit specific

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,090
implementation proposals for your chosen

00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,040
solution based on what you learned so

00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,930
far rather than these sort of broad

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,500
open-ended solutions proposals which

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,250
kind of rarely have a good result

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,299
so last a quick note about

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,980
implementation even if you're not

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,150
leading the implementation phase or in

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,919
charge of support and maintenance you

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,720
need to think of the future right so

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,309
don't be that project manager that shows

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,570
that awful thing everyone hates right

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,500
plan now and avoid damage reports later

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,720
so we want to thank in terms of

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,640
implementation timelines are their

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,740
migration concerns are there going to be

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,900
systems integrations needed that add X

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,090
sub exponential complexity to your

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,940
project do we have the infrastructure to

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,500
even support this thing right for

00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,390
support and maintenance how hard is it

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,280
going to be for existing users to switch

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,200
to the new solution you know a lot about

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,870
your current versus future state how are

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,429
your users going to bridge that gap what

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,100
will I have to do to make sure this is

00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,750
supported are there parallel projects

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,789
that block or unblock your next steps

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,919
and other hurdles like policy or

00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:19,250
training they need to be addressed

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,530
before any of this can start and lastly

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,419
think can any of us begin now and save

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,559
time and remove blockers as quickly as

00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:29,419
possible so to sum this all up we're

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,770
gonna gather complete requirements we're

00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:32,539
gonna document them we're gonna

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,580
prioritize them and we're gonna get

00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,730
stakeholder consensus across the entire

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,440
org we're gonna conduct market research

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,409
become that savvy consumer and choose

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,520
top candidates based on gap analysis

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,110
we're gonna conduct some bake-offs

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,030
to get technical vetting and buy-in from

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,039
our own team we're gonna select our

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,140
vendors carefully and manage them wisely

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,549
and humanely we're gonna plan for

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,350
implementation and support from the

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,350
beginning to ensure a successful project

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,500
completion and with that your solutions

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,830
and all your users live long and prosper

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,830
thanks very much

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,660
