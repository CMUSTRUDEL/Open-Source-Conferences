Everis, Belgium, Brussels

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's largest and most respected centres for scientific research.
The World Wide Web was born at CERN, and the laboratory’s extensive community has a long history of communicating and collaborating online.
CERN’s web includes thousands of websites with several purposes and audiences managed by different departments.

This is the context in which the Digital Portfolio (Drupal 8 Multisite oriented distribution) is conceptualized with the objective to provide a unique and personal experience online.

During this session we will explain how we afforded the key points to build the mentioned online experience which is based on:

1. Desing system and conceptualization of components: we will detailed how we defined the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy the content strategy that CERN needed.

2. We will explain how we approach the conceptualization on Drupal 8 with the main goal to improve as much as possible the Editorial Experience, by the use of WebComponets and configuration interface to play with the components and change their look&feel and effects called "Color Schema"

3. We will explain the needs in terms of external integrations with CERN services and how there were performed with Drupal 8.

4. The Digital Portfolio is also based on the Content as a service (CaaS) concept where the content is hosted by the multisite core and it is offered to a certain number of other services on demand.
