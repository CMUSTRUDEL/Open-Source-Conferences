CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's largest and most respected centres for scientific research.
The World Wide Web was born at CERN, and the laboratory’s extensive community has a long history of communicating and collaborating online.
CERN’s web includes thousands of websites with several purposes and audiences managed by different departments.

This is the context in which the Digital Portfolio (Drupal 8 Multisite oriented distribution) is conceptualized with the objective to provide a unique and personal experience online.

During this session we will explain how we afforded the key points to build the mentioned online experience which is based on:

1. Desing system and conceptualization of components: we will detailed how we defined the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy the content strategy that CERN needed.

2. We will explain how we approach the conceptualization on Drupal 8 with the main goal to improve as much as possible the Editorial Experience, by the use of WebComponets and configuration interface to play with the components and change their look&feel and effects called "Color Schema"

3. We will explain the needs in terms of external integrations with CERN services and how there were performed with Drupal 8.

4. The Digital Portfolio is also based on the Content as a service (CaaS) concept where the content is hosted by the multisite core and it is offered to a certain number of other services on demand.

early booster you can come in operation

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,190
okay welcome everybody to the trial

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,710
visit our portfolio section

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,379
my name is Madonna Franco metropolis

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,619
with more than ten years in this of

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,900
experience or get up every since seven

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,880
years and work it a work with us

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,340
apprehend manager on the detail before

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,940
you and everyone I come here working on

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,320
on Drupal for 40 years in every Sun I

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,320
work as a bracketed

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,079
so you are here to hear about how we

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,390
approach our website this is what we are

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,300
going to explain okay so for we are

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,670
willing to follow these are steps by

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,600
starting with a context of the of the

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,850
project and the digital portfolio was a

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,739
distribution right on 2 / 7 it smoothly

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,770
sideways under CERN has around 800

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:07,659
website developer Drupal 7 and in that

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,570
friends the scope of the yemeni spirit

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:15,220
was to help them to migrate the Drupal 7

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,259
distribution to a new palette 1 and also

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,270
includes different applications on that

00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:22,450
distribution

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:27,340
this project was performed by different

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:30,190
teams so we work together with our teams

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,690
based on Geneva and the average team

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:37,420
based in Spain and also in Belgium we

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,840
were distributed in three four different

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:46,390
cities depending on the time of day of

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,420
the project and now we are going to

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,489
review the understanding face ok in

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,860
order to understand the parade we have

00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:55,780
two key points the first one to go to

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,880
the the find a vision of the plateau

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,000
that responds with the needs and the

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,420
wants of the different users that in

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,729
that cables business certain education

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,399
community general public different

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,590
authorities in order to develop in that

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,209
sense a distribution that meets with the

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,209
objective of all the stakeholders

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:26,570
so the result of this study was for

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,580
exercise guided that guides for

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,070
different questions while we are

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,740
designing something new this course you

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,630
produced a vision of the project what

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,400
will be the assignment this question

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,760
covered the best thoughts of the

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,760
audience and how well the local field we

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,250
created in in this case with this

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,200
question we wanted to gather or

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,940
understand the user experience and the

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,880
local feel that the different a

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,480
stakeholder respected and hopefully this

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,630
design forum in order to attract all the

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,930
users to the new digital portfolio so we

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:06,500
perform different exercise as user

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,780
experience studies planet in Geneva at

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,480
certain premises and planet also in

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,310
Barcelona at Everest premises so as you

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,220
can see this is the result of the new

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:20,150
visual identity of the Sharpie that

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,650
portfolio it is quite cool I recommend

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,690
you to go through the website and play a

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,240
little bit we have plenty of

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,660
interactions for the users that are

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,660
really cool

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,370
and I will give the floor and it'll be

00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,120
able to explain the common face is also

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,930
brilliant

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,870
okay so after finishing the UX phase the

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,080
development in a 32 to define the design

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,830
system useful for forward a on Drupal 8

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,620
sides okay so we have started with a

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,470
through palette side a call well what

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,530
experience library that introduces final

00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,740
user it should repeal two component two

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,110
things and other topics at the moment

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,630
there is an existing was based in three

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,320
main similar features a system based on

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:16,510
components built in Drupal 8 FN here

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:21,950
with Christine and integration with

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:26,480
system regarding component and there

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:28,820
were three minutes one a solution system

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,669
built interpolate that were resolved

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,810
using butter definition based on the UI

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:39,860
pattern concrete model also we needed a

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:43,400
way to create a real lead component so

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,240
we applied its pattern with display

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,729
suite in Selita para for its component

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,590
and the last one a wore some booty

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,340
preferred solution and a first way to

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,140
start a using component okay so the

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,300
solution in this case was create at

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,540
least a model called third landing page

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,870
that is tell all companies as dependency

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,470
although each component continues

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:12,590
individually regarding things

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:16,070
the solution was clear TRC's with boost

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,150
athena's our base t then we have in this

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,220
next level we have the third phase a

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,340
theme with common element and definition

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,440
for all sites

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,830
finally we have the tint use unsightly

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,080
for example the data home okay and at

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,620
the same level we have a terrible ride

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,890
death over the third rate is a thing

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,030
used by a final user a to a piston

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,460
definitions

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,510
he probably the things we had the

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,180
decoder is key

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,550
this feature allows final user in this

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,590
case for example editors change color

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,200
without creating code we are going to

00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:00,930
see an example this is the in this case

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,200
is a the home page okay there's a

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,480
complex site and you can see that right

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:17,940
now the header region rate and a footer

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:21,690
DC in blue so inside the death in we

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,000
find I a lot of options to to be

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,760
configurable in this case we are going

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,180
to change the color for the header in

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,180
this case

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,169
and the food that you

00:06:51,509 --> 00:07:00,620
this is a preview and if you go to the

00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:06,080
left side they colors are being updated

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,080
the hell mystery nice and easy okay

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,249
the last element or fitori is the

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,889
intelligence we have for iteration

00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:19,529
integration with indigo and waked the

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,689
assistant to Menards event integration

00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,610
with the single sign-on and it is on

00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:28,110
with a CVS we are going to talk about

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,810
iteration with CVS the CVS is a service

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,360
where there has images videos Valerie's

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,479
PDFs in so many different files

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,599
resources this is integration with a

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:44,399
milling a storing files resources into

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,979
but a so the solution the solution is

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,680
Betty like this but I like it because a

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,199
at the end you don't have a fenced in in

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,020
trouble so in this case the approach was

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,999
a greater houston development based on

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,819
Drupal fields under a suite and we

00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:03,899
integrated with the CCP literature and

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:07,020
we are going to see an example this is

00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:13,770
the the CVS okay where they have in this

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:17,479
case images with an ID we copy the ID we

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,839
are using daily for integrating interval

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,589
so in the back in a we can get the

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,589
direction

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,050
so we can change the size of the image

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:37,959
and we have a other information from the

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:40,830
ACPs in the place we are going to create

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,830
a new node

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:55,509
they they know that has been created and

00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:58,230
it with we printed information and if we

00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:01,959
didn't spit you can see that at the end

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,449
information came from the - idiot okay

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:09,490
we are not studying formation files in

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:12,610
the part after finishing the development

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,430
of this feature we applied them in the

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,949
home site of their apart apart from no

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,290
they are - like create content types

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:23,230
Buse and weekly content so now we are

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:30,430
going to see a real example or how in

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:34,060
reality a man has a component this is

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:37,089
this is in this case a pizza who we are

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,189
paid well they have a difference

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,250
components in this case would have in

00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:44,610
the backing of a section for components

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:49,439
where they can edit we are going to

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,439
reorder a component

00:09:52,330 --> 00:10:02,750
everything is basing in paragraph and

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:05,210
fills with a with butters so now we had

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,810
never your day the the components and

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:11,440
now we are going to order to edit in

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:17,150
this case the title of that component

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:24,770
that component is inside the dissection

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:28,820
component is the first one the first one

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:33,890
and we entry integrated the components

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:37,960
with a serious - and in this case we're

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,960
going to change a title

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,629
so this is the mittens and now we are

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,509
going to see a function ideal of

00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:00,540
components okay you can see that here we

00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:05,550
have a company and if we change the

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:08,160
theme in the in this in the side we can

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,959
see that the look and feel is the same

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,240
okay because its component has the look

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,610
and feel JavaScript and the sources

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,259
inside inside the definition okay so

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,589
they look and fit for the component is

00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:28,790
always the same although you use a

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,790
different things

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,360
okay so you have a review what was the

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,139
result of the project and now I will

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,939
give you some figures okay

00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,790
the term digital portfolio was London

00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:01,569
last year fifth of November and since

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,220
then thrown around 800 websites that
