What is this session about?

Having a mentor is amazing and being one yourself goes beyond all your expectations. Unfortunately, a lot of talented people, women especially, have never had a formal mentor in their career. This is a huge problem â€“ a total waste of talent, that we all must do our best to solve. Indeed, mentorship matters a lot: it is a rewarding experience not only for the mentees but also for the mentors and the companies they work for.

In this session we will share with you our own experience as mentors while conducting workshops, courses and internship programs for high-school and university students as well as giving you some valuable tips, techniques and advice on how to break the stereotype and be a successful mentor.

Who is this session for?

Have you wondered what it takes to be a good mentor? Have you ever wanted to try but had some concerns? Well, we did - we have been there as well. Guess what? It turned out it is not that hard. Join us in this session if you wish to explore in detail the mentor-mentee relationship, how it works and the benefits it provides to all involved.

What will I learn from this session?

We sincerely believe that during our session you will see the beauty of mentoring, feel the magic behind it and understand the reasons why we love it, enjoy it and cherish it so much. We are looking forward to your questions and hope that at the end of the session we will have stirred your enthusiasm just enough for you to try it yourself and pay it forward.
