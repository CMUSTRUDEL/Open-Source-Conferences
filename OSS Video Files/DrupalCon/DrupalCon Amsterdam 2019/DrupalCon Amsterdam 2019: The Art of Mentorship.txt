What is this session about?

Having a mentor is amazing and being one yourself goes beyond all your expectations. Unfortunately, a lot of talented people, women especially, have never had a formal mentor in their career. This is a huge problem â€“ a total waste of talent, that we all must do our best to solve. Indeed, mentorship matters a lot: it is a rewarding experience not only for the mentees but also for the mentors and the companies they work for.

In this session we will share with you our own experience as mentors while conducting workshops, courses and internship programs for high-school and university students as well as giving you some valuable tips, techniques and advice on how to break the stereotype and be a successful mentor.

Who is this session for?

Have you wondered what it takes to be a good mentor? Have you ever wanted to try but had some concerns? Well, we did - we have been there as well. Guess what? It turned out it is not that hard. Join us in this session if you wish to explore in detail the mentor-mentee relationship, how it works and the benefits it provides to all involved.

What will I learn from this session?

We sincerely believe that during our session you will see the beauty of mentoring, feel the magic behind it and understand the reasons why we love it, enjoy it and cherish it so much. We are looking forward to your questions and hope that at the end of the session we will have stirred your enthusiasm just enough for you to try it yourself and pay it forward.

working with Drupal for two years now

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,590

Cody gross so let's start

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:31,530
the first question is what does metric

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,390
mean well we all know that mattering you

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,720
typically find is a professional

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,580
relationship a little more experienced

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,369
developer or specialist provides some

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,020
helpful systems to another person in

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,399
developing better skills and knowledge

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,070
but is it oh actually it's not and

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:55,140
they're a lot more aspects to mentoring

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:58,380
that only training of course the more

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,250
the more the main focus is being you

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,490
experience

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,830
brodnik your expertise in general people

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,160
are quite capable of learning from their

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:11,009
own right but no one can replace the

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,260
presence of a mentor a person who can

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,989
give them advice at the right moment who

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,090
can encourage you what if you blue we

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,300
can motivate you to keep fighting and

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,300
guide you when you get lost or sometimes

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,090
even knowing that there is someone out

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,690
there who believes in you can be all the

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,690
support needed

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,630
the mentor-mentee relationship is indeed

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,770
a special bond it's twice in terms that

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:44,500
a community owns it requires

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,000
communication and developing skills and

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,740
everyone involved sirs ideas and

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,960
experience how the matters also widen

00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,260
their field of expertise it's not only

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,900
about mentees right we know that the

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,330
best way to learn is to teach the the

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,180
relationship should be open and open and

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,370
honest and always like I've had three

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,220
matters in my life and there are my

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:17,630
friends forever I love them a lot so

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:20,840
it's always good to have a mentor and in

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,690
fact mentors do have matters everybody

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,720
needs to recognize that we can all learn

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,430
and benefit from each other this is the

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,780
most natural thing and can change our

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:38,300
life for you so I believe we already are

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,310
getting there but why is my drink so

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:45,410
important metric is important because

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,200
it's an activity which has multiple

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,320
benefits for everyone let's check them

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,320
out

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,630
the mentee should be the primary focus

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,790
of this relationship having commentar

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,489
can help you understand everything

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,770
faster it gives you the benefit of

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,510
having someone you can rely on when you

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,800
need help

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,420
mentors can also help motivate you by

00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,150
supporting you in solving harder

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,349
problems or provide you with a different

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,019
perspective you haven't thought about

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:23,050
you always have someone you can count on

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:25,270
that makes learning easier linka mentor

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,160
yourself has benefits as well by

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,750
teaching and supporting someone you also

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,150
enhance your own skills and knowledge

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,490
it's a good way to learn new stuff or

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,080
brexit the basics you also get to see a

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,360
different perspective to see how a

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,850
beginner will tackle a problem and you

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,169
might learn something new from that

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,610
mentoring helps you improve your

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,070
communication and leadership skills

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,229
because you need both of them in order

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,300
to be able to properly help your mentee

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,860
you are doing something good and

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,630
beneficial for others and are giving

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,400
back to the community by increasing its

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:59,200
numbers if your employees are mentors

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,120
your business can benefit as well

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,190
if colleagues are mentoring each other

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,000
this can raise the overall performance

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,640
and productivity everyone shares their

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,820
knowledge and experience if your company

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,100
mentors students or interns this can

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,710
increase brand recognition people notice

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,990
the company more often you raise the

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,610
reputation and easy way to attract

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,840
potential future employees of the

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,150
company there is something in for the

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,370
community as well mentoring helps

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,680
increase the number of people interested

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,570
in joining the community in our case

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,729
with Drupal mentoring as potential

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,240
contributors and promotes deposit

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,240
technology

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,590
if you're fortunate enough to have a

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,660
great mentor you are more likely to

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,610
become successful at an early age

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,330
for example Bill Gates and Mark

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,590
Zuckerberg this is the case with them

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,200
mentoring builds new perspectives and

00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:03,210
widens the horizons of both the mentor

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:07,320
and mentee but how to be a good mentor

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,320
it's the great person indeed

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,499
winters

00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,439
and the very first thing you need to do

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:21,469
is to actually step out of your comfort

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,989
zone and try being a mental doctor this

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:27,889
mightier skills and don't be shy to

00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:30,649
drive there's a big problem with matters

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:32,329
and a lot of people especially women

00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,579
have never had a man to entire

00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,939
professional life it's a total waste of

00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:39,019
talent

00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,579
I'm sure you're all agree and after all

00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:43,999
the most difficult thing is to start

00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:46,059
right so just step in and try on your

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,059
own

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,140
we all know about the imposter syndrome

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,510
right

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,510
the man feeling that makes us question

00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,360
our skills our knowledge and can make a

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,660
stain corner stay behind the stage never

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,710
try to make anything but in fact of you

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:11,520
can over you know a lot and enough to

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,590
spread or to share with the right so do

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
you don't need we all don't need oh crap

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,750
that life's just too short well it oh

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,550
and whatever you know you can share it

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,940
no one else everything but nobody

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,950
expects you to know everything and even

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,860
your mentee can work together in an

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:36,840
honest way breaking the stereotype is

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,940
something very important you don't need

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,940
to have the traditional image of a

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,590
teacher or instructor in fact the mentor

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,260
mentee relationship can be quite

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,050
personal as well it should be only

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,870
honest and you as a mentor have to

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,160
discover the needs of your mentee and

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,610
you need to have an individual approach

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,020
which means that if you have several

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,010
monkeys at the same time you should

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,230
consider their interest their field of

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,330
expertise what they can improve where

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,280
they have to work more and so on and you

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,460
can need to follow you you should focus

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,720
on bees also you should respect things

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,240
like racial political gender differences

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,810
things like that and you should respect

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,810
them of course

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,420
in in general you suit so your good side

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,950
should be open and honest you should

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,290
build a relationship with your mentee

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,500
that they'll be based on trust and to

00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:37,930
learn to respond to his or her needs but

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,419
sometimes you also need to so you're bad

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,630
right because you don't have to do

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,290
everything inside of your mentee on the

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:50,110
contrary you need to work away to step

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,820
away and let them work independently

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,140
in order to provide the best out of them

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,230
Pearson show them the different options

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,570
exist and they are the ones who have to

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,770
choose the right one or just to make a

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,600
decision you need to require more and in

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,720
this way you'll get the most out of your

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,730
mentees of course and to not forget that

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,850
sometimes we have to give some

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,260
constructive feedback sometimes we need

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,260
to keep the mighty on the ground

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,970
and in this process as we already said

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,980
we all improve ourselves we should spend

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:35,770
some time as well to prepare for our me

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,960
to work with our mentee there are topics

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,790
that we need to cover there are some

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,570
materials that you can provide them so

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,750
to make this process easier but in fact

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,630
you should also allow yourself to learn

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,400
from your mine T we do this all the time

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,770
and we learn a lot even from our

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,520
students high school University it

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,140
doesn't matter

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,880
everyone knows something that the other

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:04,840
doesn't and that's the beauty behind

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:09,810
mentally okay we are already getting

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,810
there but how do we do it

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,700
so after telling you about one you

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,649
should consider mentoring and how to

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,019
improve it I would like to share with

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,329
you how we are actually doing mentoring

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:28,269
so you can get an idea of how to do it

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:30,250
yourself there are many ways to start

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,870
mentoring and helping people one of them

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,320
is organizing different events like

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,120
meetups workshops courses and camps we

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,490
as part of Kony girls in our local

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,399
Drupal community have organized many

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,740
events one of the things we do is to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,899
provide access to all of them for free

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,660
that way more people will be able to

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:55,470
come and learn something new now in this

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,450
picture you can see me as a mentee on

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,959
coding girls event which Maria organized

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,450
test it was for Drupal and several

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:09,310
months later you can see me as the

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:12,519
mentor of my own course now there are

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:17,170
some more pictures of courses workshops

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:20,529
and events we have organized now this

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,670
next one is from HTML CSS course and

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:27,070
it's right after the students graduated

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,380
we also included providing certificates

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,610
to our mentees so they can feel

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,610
appreciation from their work

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,719
this is an event where coding girls

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:44,219
participated it was at the International

00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:47,099
girls and I sit today and that picture

00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:52,949
is from a local topic and uploaded which

00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:55,889
we organized another thing we do is to

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:57,239
take university students as interns it's

00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,639
a good way for them to learn about

00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:03,779
Drupal and a good way for us to find

00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,819
potential new colleagues and this is a

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:11,159
picture from one of their one of our

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:12,809
student groups at Lotus mentoring

00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,359
doesn't always need to be between a

00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,919
beginner and an expert to people with

00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:20,519
similar level can also exchange

00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:24,029
knowledge no matter what you can always

00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:29,069
learn something new from everyone so we

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:32,719
have metric at the office as well let's

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,719
summarize all we have discussed today

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,830
yes sir gluten product mentoring

00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,270
relationship with the right person

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,760
provides huge benefits for both sides

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,529
I'm sure you all agree on that matters

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,570
and mentees improve their knowledge

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:53,790
their performance they they do this much

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,640
better that much faster than they would

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,709
otherwise do so not to mention how much

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,660
fun it is for both sides it is

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,270
definitely a time well spent for both

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,100
parties how do we know that the answer

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:11,700
is simple by stepping up and being

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:13,380
mentors one of the best boats out there

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,420
belongs to John Cross here it says

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,279
mentoring is a brain to pick on the

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,230
earth to listen and push in the right

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,709
direction and I think we can both agree

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,709
on that

00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,989
thank you and don't forget to show your

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,569
appreciation towards your winters and of

00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:42,769
course try it on your own spread some

00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:44,509
chocolate and magic around one of the

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,389
best ways to start is to step out of

00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:49,369
your comfort zone and try it on your own

00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:53,349
join the community contribution day and

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:53,349
find the mentor or become one yourself

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,810
we will appreciate your feedback and now

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:08,810
is there time for your question

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:17,430
we love discussion so please anyone

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:23,430
there's opportunity for you so many

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:26,579
women to your courses yeah we organize

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:30,149
events that are especially organized and

00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:33,630
announced as advance for ladies and yeah

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:35,790
some women do need this they have a

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,230
little push or to feel a little support

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:42,000
but it works in work if we have like

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,550
fifteen twenty-firsts people and each

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,490
one that we organize we have also

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,199
workshops we present know just like we

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:53,130
start with front-end development because

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:57,769
it's easier to understand concrete

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,769
approach have you put flyers to your

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,470
yeah we mainly use Facebook to advertise

00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:07,430
our ones with coding girls initiative

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,320
but also we work at the University where

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,510
we teach students during their

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,970
internship programs and that they come

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,040
also to our company this is also a good

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,079
way to approach more women because in

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,920
Bulgaria there are a lot of girls who

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,930
study scientists science in general and

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,390
yeah Bulgaria is on top of the list of

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,810
countries with women working in the IT

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:35,449
field so actually there is interest they

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,449
just need some support can I uh

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,440
like everywhere we visit or speak

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,850
somewhere or we to juice our company

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,710
somewhere we also introduce colleague

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,040
herbs as well so this is a way to

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,660
promote it and one thing we strive to do

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,160
is to make sure that everyone is welcome

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,160
so so they feel welcome

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,860
doing that and where is the best place

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,860
to find the maintain reliable

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,850
I never had some such experience but

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,820
one of the best best ways is actually

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,330
opportunity like this one here you can

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,080
meet a lot of cool people there are guys

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:27,980
and girls who have never tried before

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:31,460
even me they may not be technical

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:35,089
technical person but you just meet

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:38,600
people husband if you wish we can we are

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:43,279
always looking for my toes yes and I can

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,750
talk about this later but if you ask I'm

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:50,360
sure there will be a lot of people who

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:52,900
are ready and to find winter to this as

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,760
well now also the universities or

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,710
because students like in schools are a

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,200
really good approach as well because

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,050
people they always need someone to

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,030
mentor them so if you're part of a

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,160
company you can you can always ask to

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,160
take students as mentees

00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:22,610
questions other questions yeah this is

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,610
this really time to talk

00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:30,360
but I need you to repeat it place so

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:33,330
anniversary starter job

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,820
the question is what percentage of the

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:39,360
students successfully start a jobs and

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:43,410
as Drupal developers and we actually

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,470
don't have exact numbers on that and I'm

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,620
I think so far only few of them have

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,980
started so interested big but in our

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,410
case way from Bulgaria and in our city

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,630
case there wasn't really an opening

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,950
really from them so they weren't happy

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:04,560
with that yes this is absolutely one of

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,300
the problems so everybody speaks how the

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,280
Drupal community needs more young power

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,190
and right and students and people

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,920
working so that not only the same faces

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,200
come to the events again and again but

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,660
actually the interest there is a big

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,580
interest towards Drupal and I have no

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,040
problem to motivate my students and make

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,680
them start working with Drupal however

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,690
we have problem with the business with

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,100
the companies because most companies are

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,310
looking for here's what the senior

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,030
developers but somebody needs to build

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,710
these senior developers so here we

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,800
should work more closely with the

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,560
business and we need some support so

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,290
that those young specialists that just

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,730
have graduated can start working and

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,960
gain more practice

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,960
but in general

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,420
if that's all we will finish now and let

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,100
our colleague to join you and present

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,020
his mission and if you have more

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,790
questions so we want to speak with us we

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,900
are here when I play so just reach out

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:12,209
like thanks thank you

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:12,209
