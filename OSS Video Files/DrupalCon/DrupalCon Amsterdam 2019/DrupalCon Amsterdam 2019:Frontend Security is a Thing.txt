Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Presenter: Madalina Cotumbeanu
Description: When we say FrontEnd, we mainly think of the glue that sticks, the Designer's vision and the BackEnd's implementation, together.

We make things look pretty for the final user, we make it easier for people to surface our page in style, we make everything flashy.

Thinking about security you might be tempted to correlate it with Backend development. But I am here to try and show that FrontEnders have the same level of responsibility when it comes to securing our web pages. We will go through the main issues that make up the FrontEnd Security Checklist.
