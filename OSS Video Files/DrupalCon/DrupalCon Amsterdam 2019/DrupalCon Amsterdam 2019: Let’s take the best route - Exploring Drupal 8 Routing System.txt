Session content
-------------------------
Drupal 8's routing system came from Symfony's. Drupal's routing system can do everything Symfony's can (and more).
Drupal 7 used hook_menus. In Drupal 8 module’s routes are defined in yaml files and these trigger actions defined in module’s controller.

In our talk, we're going to cover

How Routing happens in Symfony

How Drupal 8 makes use Symfony’s routing system using yaml and controllers

How is Different from Drupal 7

What all(and more) Drupal’s routing system can do

Execution precedence of same routes

Structuring Drupal 8 routes

A working demo



Takeaways
---------------
Defining your own routes your own way.

Best practices while defining routes.

At the end of this session you be see how routing dumps a URL matcher or generator specific to a particular routes and how it maps an HTTP requests.



Prerequisites
--------------------
Understanding of Drupal 8 module development is required.

Experience with Object Oriented Programming will be advantageous.

everyone can I get a good evening back

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:12,000
thank you

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,750
I know a little bit sleepy but just bear

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,260
with me for some more time so thank you

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:23,580
for showing up it's a really good to see

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,590
all these faces and welcome to the

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,859
beautiful city of canals and welcome to

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,790
to look on Amsterdam thank you for

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,399
joining me to the session in the topic

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,040
for my session is let's take the best

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,300
route exploring Drupal 8 and routing

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,350
system so I have made this presentation

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,950
or with the help of symphony calm and

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:53,399
Drupal dot-org and try to bring the best

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,129
of both of the walls to make sure that

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,070
it is a good presentation and I would be

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,250
starting from a very basic level and as

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,290
I progressed I would be using some

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,200
introductory examples and some

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,939
screenshots to make sure that the

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,439
session is well understood and well

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:17,490
received by you all so introducing

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,869
myself my name is service rifle and I

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:27,240
work with 3G technologies on Drupal I go

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,720
by the name su RBC or you can search me

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,820
in my complete name to locate my profile

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,040
on Twitter I go by the handles will be

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,630
three-bath don't forget to take this

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,390
conversation while using my Twitter

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,520
handle so at version I am primarily

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,729
involved with Drupal 7 angle favorite

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,890
projects which also means that I have

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,649
worked with teams over N o we have

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,610
designed systems which have used various

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,549
flavors on truffle and talking about

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,670
estrogen so oestrogen is a 15 year old

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,880
company and a when students started it

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,119
was mainly involved with a lot of non

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,680
rupal stuff like our word

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:16,310
by porn Jango but 45 years later surgeon

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,290
got it hands dirty with Drupal and now 8

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,370
to 9 years later we have a good group

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,310
name with the 200 plus people primarily

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,030
focused towards drooper making us Asia's

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,220
largest roof will go deeper and

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,170
stretchin has its headquarters in India

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:39,440
New Delhi and we have colleagues working

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:41,150
on across the bill ok so before I start

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,140
up again I would like to just set the

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:48,260
context right here so that we are well

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,269
aligned on what we are actually going

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,590
through the presentation while I skim

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:56,510
through so this is sort of an agenda I

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,150
will be starting from an overview where

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,920
they have an introductory example we

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,099
would be seeing the underlying mechanism

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,860
of routing that is HTTP Colonel how

00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:13,069
Drupal 8 routing is different from

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:16,100
Drupal 7 using menu how Drupal 8 makes

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,920
uses of iron male and controllers will

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,810
also see structures of routes simple

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,530
access checks using permissions and

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,370
roles dynamic routes using patterns and

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:31,370
routes and I would conclude this session

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:37,329
with the help of a basic summary of what

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,329
we have talked about so let's begin so

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:48,540
this picture what it signifies anybody

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:55,049
from the audience a car

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:58,680
and okay okay so basically you can see a

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,829
car is traveling right so it is starting

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,450
from some sort of a starting point and a

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:07,530
reaching some sort of a destination

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,450
right so taking some path in between

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,250
right

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,590
similarly we all have a travel to this

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,750
DrupalCon Amsterdam right we might have

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,239
taken same path or we might have taken

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,019
different paths

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:25,110
okay so similarly in Drupal a path is

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,680
defined as a way which will return some

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,350
sort of quantity for example if I say

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,550
slash node which is the front page of a

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,729
basic Drupal installation is a route

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,340
slash node / edit pad which opens up a

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,070
node at forum or I can say know would

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:50,039
edit page which opens up a node edit

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:53,340
form is also a router so most of us

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,550
might have got a chance to work with MVC

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,930
frameworks right many of them and some

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,229
of us might have also worked

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,180
specifically with symphony right for

00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,550
those who have not got a chance to work

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,430
with symphony this slide is a very basic

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,729
slide which our clients how routing

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:15,660
works with symphony so if you see in

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:18,510
symphony there is an app controller then

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,930
there is conflict directory and then we

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,990
have without in that vinyl fire so block

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,500
show is a route and which is mapped to

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,960
path slash block whenever slash load is

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,180
hit then controller name is called and

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,010
method is invoked this is how our

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:41,729
routing takes place in symphony and if

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:45,180
right of Drupal 7 so a when we work with

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:50,310
Drupal 7 then routing is handled by a

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:53,400
function hook menu and in Drupal 7 this

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,389
function not only handles routing but it

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,270
also handles access controls visible

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,539
navigation

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,650
so a lot of responsibilities are handled

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:08,169
by this function okay and so there is a

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,599
table called menu router with tours over

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,639
the paths and as soon as the request

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,889
comes in that path is fetched from that

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,520
table and the corresponding request is

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,160
fetched

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,380
so for those of you who have not got a

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:44,979
chance to a dig deeper into this table

00:06:20,380 --> 00:07:05,740
we can just do that right now so I'm

00:06:44,979 --> 00:07:08,289
going to use a Drupal 7 database so you

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,250
see oh this is what the table is

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:15,639
actually formed off it has fields which

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:19,199
I paths then access arguments access

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:34,030
callbacks so all these are basically

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:35,979
defining the structure of a table so if

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:41,380
I see what this table has in store for

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:44,259
us this is a storage section pull it out

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,680
from this table so you see so in Drupal

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:50,800
7 this concept was handled by menu

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,990
router table and anybody who is coming

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,139
in from an MVC background this sort of a

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,000
concept or alien concept right who be

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:03,669
you are not much aware of what was

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,320
happening behind the scenes so Drupal 8

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,470
brings up some sort of a transparency

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,780
wherein it says good

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,970
to hook menu so if you see on the screen

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,690
this is a very basic implementation of

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:21,110
hook menu which was there in Rupa 7 what

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,230
Drupal 8 is not using this at all and it

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,160
has said goodbye to many so what will it

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,830
uses them so Drupal 8 has borrowed is

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,370
round taking mechanism from symphony and

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,400
it makes uses of HTTP kernel if you want

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,650
to locate this kernel you can just go on

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,300
to your trooper folders inside that is a

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,070
vendor directory then is a symphony

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,640
component and you can just dip deeper

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,980
into the code how it works at a

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,350
conceptual level I can just explain you

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,110
right now so we have a block diagram

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,760
here wherein we have four blocks the

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,220
request block which is generating some

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,440
sort of response so let's just

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,530
understand little bit by focusing on the

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,290
request block first we're in a request

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:10,100
is coming in and this request will be a

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,250
post or a get request which is coming in

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,320
from a desktop or a mobile device and a

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,400
response is being generated in the form

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,590
of HTML or JSON and if a successful

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,990
response is generated then the status

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,530
code is 200 else we have a photon

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,750
through page so HTTP kernel is taking in

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,350
this request and it is generating its

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,260
response but to do that it is making use

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,180
of some other systems right and what are

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,600
these other systems so these are viable

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:44,990
files and controllers which we will see

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,210
further in our session whenever a user

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,480
is accessing the path then Drupal

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,640
basically checks if the requirements are

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,730
being met that is the permission and the

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,530
role are connect and the requirements

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,410
are being met and then a successful

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:04,190
response is generated as we get a phone

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,500
or four page so let's just talk about

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,030
these other systems which facilitate

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,540
this response generation so we have

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:16,970
routing file and we have controllers

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,880
talking about wyman file so wireless

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,560
file is nothing but it basically does

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,630
rupal how to behave and

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,779
ever a particular request is encountered

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,779
so this is a very basic implementation

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:32,690
of a routing file which is taking module

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:36,650
name dot routing dot yml as an extra

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,200
naming convention and this route is

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:42,430
mounted flowerpower slash examples

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,470
so whenever slash example is hit

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:48,020
permission access content is checked and

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,170
if the accessing user has the role of an

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,330
administrator in this case then example

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,330
controller is called and content method

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,480
is invoked and what our controller so

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,670
needless to define them it is basically

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,080
a piece of code which generates some

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:08,240
sort of response object so this is a

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,640
very basic implementation of a Content

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,730
function which is generating a simple

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,360
hello world markup and we can place the

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,750
controllers in s RC controller directory

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:24,529
very basic now just expanding our

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:29,210
structure of routes so we just had a

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:30,950
glance at what the viable file has at a

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,610
very basic level this is a sort of an

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,800
extension of that wherein I have a kind

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,480
of extended the requirements so if you

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
see the requirements section you would

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,380
see there is permission section and

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,230
there is it all section so I have

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,480
separated permission 100 permission to

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,150
with the help of a coma which defines an

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,430
all operation and the old one is being

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,880
separated from rule 2 with the help Plus

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,180
which defines an ADD operation so just

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,060
to explain this whenever our user is

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,540
accessing slash example if he has role

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:08,240
Content writer and content moderator and

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,080
has the permission of access content or

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,630
access user profile then this path would

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,490
return true example controller would be

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:21,529
called and content key method would be

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:24,110
involved but systems don't just function

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,700
on static routes and we do have dynamic

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,130
routes so this is a very basic

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,690
implementation of dynamic route where

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,570
slug is a wild-card place Cola and it

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,139
can take

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:40,829
until and unless defined but here I have

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:43,350
defined slugs as en or fr so if the user

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,720
enters the value of slug as en or Fr

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,290
then this route would return true and

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,440
block so function would be called one

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,120
thing to notice here is that only the

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,630
second argument of the path can be

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,430
dynamic so we cannot do slash slash

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,949
slash long that is actually not

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,670
permitted and we should only keep the

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:08,339
second arguments of the round to be done

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,149
then there is also something named param

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,800
sin routes

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:16,220
Oh wherein if anybody wishes to use the

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,139
complete entity type then he can do that

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:24,509
so user is the name of a complete entity

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:28,350
type and if somebody over here enters a

00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:30,990
user ID and that user ID re is existing

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,430
in the system then in the controller you

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,310
would be presented with the complete

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:40,980
user object which you can leverage and

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:42,839
do any sort of going about that so if if

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,910
that is the case when the user exists in

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:52,170
the system and if the user does not

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:54,029
exist then so this is a basic

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,500
implementation wherein show user

00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:00,899
function is taking the user object and

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,149
returning some sort of a mother and here

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,750
in dollar user you would get the

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:11,399
complete user information which you can

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,079
use for any sort of coding into your

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,839
system

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:21,480
this mechanism is also known as casting

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:24,329
and if you want to go into much more

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,439
details then you can refer to this link

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:31,259
on the slide one thing to notice here is

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:35,220
the while I was just trying out these

00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:37,199
things on my local machine some of the

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,560
changes were not actually reflecting

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,209
into the system right so this is because

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,360
there's some sort of caching is being

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:48,890
held and

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,410
if you want to just make sure that the

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,750
changes are reflected and you don't want

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,610
to even clear the caches but you just

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,430
have to be well there after information

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,370
and you can take the help of these

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,460
useful commands so if you use brush you

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,130
can use rush environment Drupal service

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,900
route to filter rebuilt and if you

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,740
hidden troop to control and you can use

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:21,050
rupal router rebuilds command

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:25,940
am I talking too much right okay so just

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:29,420
to summarize the steps to follow when we

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,540
define a round name attached a path URL

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:36,410
to it the site this URL has to be static

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,090
or dynamic if dynamic then we might use

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,270
to sanitize these values because they

00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:43,100
are not sanitized by default which or we

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,560
can do with the help of some regular

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,740
expressions like we can define those

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,100
values to be integers so that user

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:57,740
cannot enter any malfunction of strings

00:15:52,100 --> 00:16:00,410
and at times we may want to restrict the

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:04,700
access which we can do with the help of

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:08,870
access our checks we have seen that

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,090
symphony is somebody who is using HTTP

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,150
kernel and duple has followed its

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,160
mechanism from symphony but Drupal is

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:21,020
obviously capable of doing much more

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,010
which Symphony is not which is with the

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:28,040
help of entity types we can leverage the

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:31,910
complete user object this is one other

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:37,280
things like access checks defining

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,230
permissions routes and yeah trucha gate

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,260
has decoupled the very tight coupling

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,720
which was present in Drupal menu or

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,120
Drupal 7 when hook menu was responsible

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,230
for a lot of functions behind the scenes

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,690
I have pushed this code to this

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,840
repository in case you want to have a

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:03,630
look you

00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:06,060
check this out and just - I just read

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,310
this code somewhere technology connects

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,760
us and Technology unites us and

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,380
Technology amplifies our power and a

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,740
Drupal community it can be seen well

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,890
we're in we are already supporting a lot

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,709
of people to learn motivating them and

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:31,830
achieve something really really good so

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:35,400
just keep doing more of this

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,770
motivational stuff and the fun just does

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,950
not end here I have another session on

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,940
render API in the same room after this

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,930
session in case you wish to join that

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:52,890
you are most welcome

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:55,160
and join us for the contributions thank

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:59,229
you
