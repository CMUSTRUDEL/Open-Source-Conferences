Last fall at Drupal Europe, a group of privacy advocates both from within and outside of the Drupal community met to discuss what privacy would look like in Drupal core.

From those conversations, the Cross-CMS Privacy Working Group was formed (https://github.com/joomla/cross-cms-compliance) bringing together teams from Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, Umbraco and Typo3. As a cooperative group representing the majority of the CMS and web world, this is a great opportunity for Drupal to have a seat at the table and work with other groups to form a unified foundation for privacy on the web.

To do this effectively, and to put to practice the work from the Cross-CMS Privacy Working Group, Drupal should adopt a core privacy initiative. The beginnings of what the initiative looks like can be found at: https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/3009356 .

This session is to discuss the work of the Cross-CMS Privacy Working Group, and how this impacts the proposed plan for the core privacy initiative. It's also a time to lay out the proposed plan for a privacy initiative and hear back from the community on what they would and wouldn't like to see included in it.
