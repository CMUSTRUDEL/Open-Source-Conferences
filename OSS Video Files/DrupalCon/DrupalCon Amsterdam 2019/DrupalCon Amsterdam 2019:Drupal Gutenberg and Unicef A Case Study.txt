Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019:Drupal Gutenberg and Unicef A Case Study
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2019
Description: 
	Room: Auditorium
Presenter: Thor Andre Gretland, Marco Fernandes
Description: Drupal and the Gutenberg editor is a killer combination, empowering content authors to build rich landing pages inside a rock solid CMS framework. The Drupal Gutenberg module is stable and continuously updated and improved!

Authors and marketeers want to focus on effectively perfecting their content. They want to adjust and improve, and have the flexibility to create exciting content that stands out. All of this needs to happen within the agreed boundaries of their own design manual:

They should be able to decide this color here, and that color there - only within their own color palette. Choose a text size or style variations on some elements, and let the rest be strictly defined.
The backend UI for doing all of this can often become overwhelming and bloated by dropdowns of parameters and so on. Gutenberg handles this in a nice and shiny way.

In this session we’ll show you how we worked with specifying the right level of flexibility, showing the needed options in the right places.

We’ll talk about the best practices when creating your own custom Gutenberg blocks. Give real examples on when to extend the Gutenberg core blocks, and when to start from scratch. We want to create nicely customized UIs with a great return of investment.

Best practices through examples: Demoing how we’re using Gutenberg core blocks, Drupal core blocks, dynamic listing blocks, blocks integrating with other sites, custom blocks and cloud blocks to handle different needs.

We’ll compare the UNICEF setup to other clients, showing how different organizations have different needs for often the same output and kind of content.

Drupal 8 is a rock solid CMS framework packed with powerful admin features. Our users expect a CMS to be both flexible and easy to use. Building a shiny landing page shouldn’t be hard!

Oh, and expect great details that everyone loves: Livesearch for inserting blocks, copy/paste a full landing page - or just half of it, create your own new blocks within the editor, insert media with drag-n-drop, reorganize with drag-n-drop, and much more!

Having inhouse experience with both Drupal, WordPress and React, we ported Gutenberg to Drupal 8. It’s working, and it’s smooth.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,420
ready

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,300
hello everyone

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,100
in most cases the need for flexibility

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,739
does not account for the people working

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,390
with the system handling things like

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:45,970
customer journeys personalization

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,390
creating campaign pages analytics and

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:52,239
you know all kinds of systems like that

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,970
typically when a client says flexible it

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,559
usually means something else then when

00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:04,449
we say it and more flexible means more

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,659
complexity and also harder to use so how

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,820
many of you haven't heard things like

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,580
well we want to change this it's the CMS

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,270
because what we have today is hard to

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,610
work with or Google is complex

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,170
which brings us freedom that's fine but

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,000
it can be overwhelming

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:35,620
sometimes or Drupal has a steep learning

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:37,810
curve but you know when we get there we

00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,670
want to make our clients the superheroes

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,060
and and we were sort of just helping

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,880
them to get there without spending hours

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,360
and hours of learning and reading and

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,990
documentation and hard workflows which

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,010
involve

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,530
basically too many people often are we

00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,870
in front come we believe that we can

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,820
change that we strongly believe that we

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,700
can turn Drupal into the most

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,390
user-friendly tool out there and we've

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,670
just started we want to make all people

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,760
that are working with content and

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:16,060
creating value from day to day to be the

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,220
superheroes we want them to be able to

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,670
focus on what they are supposed to do

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:27,700
and we want it to be fun to work with

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:31,000
Drupal now when we were in in Drupal

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,159
Europe last year and we showed what we

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,650
had done so far with the drupal

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:40,720
Guttenberg module and we got some

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:44,840
awesome feedback which encourages

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,629
our most important client in digital

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,500
projects are those who are going to work

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:55,390
with the system day in and day out and

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,970
this is not really about technology or

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,629
coding or features it's about having the

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:05,799
tool to make the job easy fun and enable

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:11,530
the user to focus on what really matters

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:16,040
and this is what we experienced when

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,530
introducing the Gutenberg editor some

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,470
people that has to work the CMS is for

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,780
years can seem spec skeptic at first you

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,659
know the change is too big I don't know

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:31,280
where to start people won't understand

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:33,709
this but that is just opinions what we

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,120
see with people that are new to CMS's

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:41,269
are reactions like this things evolve

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,790
this is excellent you know we we want

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,790
this where do I sign stuff like that

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:54,829
Drupal should be the most user-friendly

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,359
enterprise CMS and this is also what DS

00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,190
was talking about in the briefs note

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,019
today

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,819
Drupal should be easy to use for

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,819
newcomers and we think it's possible

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,040
this Drupal community are full of

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,669
superheroes that can make this happen

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,579
now let's go a few hundred years back in

00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:19,729
time and have a look at this guy you

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,280
hung Guttenberg we're still using his

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,870
name he played a key role in the

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,669
development of the Renaissance the

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,520
Reformation the age of the Enlightenment

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,410
and the Scientific Revolution that laid

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,310
the basis for spreading learning to the

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,919
mass spectrum and today we are working

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,400
with software to the masses and

00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:43,639
open-source is truly that we're not

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,490
talking about virtual reality though in

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:52,219
this session but Gutenberg is kind of

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,960
you know in a sense a part of a new way

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:58,580
of thinking web

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,340
generation and we can say that Gutenberg

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,880
gives our eyes new input on the aspect

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,280
of creating content for the web it is a

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,990
revolution that changes how authors and

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,620
editors can focus on their daily

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,870
deliveries not just you know brag about

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:20,479
being the ones that understand how to

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:23,930
use a system so what it's actually the

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:34,039
Gutenberg editor oh this is a tiny bit

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:37,940
of it let's dig in so this is the

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:40,810
Norwegian but I go to a new page and I

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:45,830
start to add for example a heading I

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:49,000
type in some text there which would be

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,180
my title I set that to be the h1 and

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,720
then I'll paste some more text and this

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:59,930
should be my teaser bold slightly larger

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,030
and of course we want that to be like

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,849
the separate proper drip afield we'll

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:11,030
get back to that i pasted some more

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:13,460
content and i want to add an image next

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,729
to that content so i just drag and drop

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:21,680
that into the editor and it loads and

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:24,020
i'm able to align it in the way i want i

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,240
can remove my spacing up there but then

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,979
i want to maybe drag it to make it

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,320
smaller so very very flexible but some

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,909
of you are in my thinking you know we

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,849
can do this you know we need to follow

00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:41,509
our grid snyder design and totally we'll

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:45,430
get back to that so now I'm just adding

00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:49,669
some text here a caption for that image

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:53,030
and I can also show you something here

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:56,479
which to add new blocks I could just

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,009
start by typing a forward slash like you

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,280
see here and then I will start a type

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:03,589
gallery you see a live search and now

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,130
since this is the top of my results I

00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:09,710
can hit enter and it adds that block

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,130
I go to the media library and select a

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:18,590
few images that I think is nice hit

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,960
select now thank you and then I'm able

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,630
to move my images back and forth the

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,830
order I can also choose to have like

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,050
four column set up which looks like this

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:34,310
or I could change it back to maybe two

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:42,760
or even one which kind of doesn't work

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:46,850
in this context but my doing others then

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:51,170
we could try to add something like quote

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,940
in the bottom here I start typing my

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,930
opinion I don't do that in our regular

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,510
paragraph it's just like it's just like

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,090
some text then I can convert that to a

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,580
quote and you see that I get a new field

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,860
below there I'm able to set the author

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:13,580
for that quote which is myself in this

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:16,400
situation and finalize it like that I'm

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,460
able to drag and drop it up to where I

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,340
want I can also use the arrows for that

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,340
and you see that the focus of that block

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,020
follows the rest of the page so it's not

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:33,770
that confusing to see where you are

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:36,380
currently okay so we'll try to go

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,960
slightly deeper into it look at another

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,760
kind of layout that we could build just

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:46,490
with the core Guttenberg blocks so in

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,950
the bottom here I'm adding a column and

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,130
I you see that I get a layout to choose

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,770
from there and I want to choose that one

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,910
which has a slightly larger left column

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,190
and a smaller right column this could

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,250
all be predefined of course following in

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,130
my design for the site I'm just going to

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,010
copy paste some text up here and paste

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:14,390
that and then hit the plus button for

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:16,910
the right column to be able to add some

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,570
content there as well I start with a

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,580
quote which we tested earlier

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,340
I think we should use Marco for this

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,780
example what do you say Marco nice

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:31,890
column will you use that Marco yeah yeah

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:37,780
he says that he will for sure

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:39,160
Marco great so right below that I can

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,320
hit the plus button to add something

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,680
above that quote and I want to add an

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,890
image that's final an image of Marco

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,450
which is not Marco you know is still

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,910
there out here in the darkness but he's

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,910
coming out soon yeah it doesn't look

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,920
like that though and then we can add

00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:01,180
some contact information for Marco here

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,510
below a telephone number this is not

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,190
release number though so you can't

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,550
really troll him by trying to call him

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,680
during the session and some email

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,110
address now this is just a text

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,910
paragraph and I can set a background

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:23,470
color to that and notice that it also

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:27,220
inverts the text color but I am able to

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:29,620
override that if I really need to by

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:36,870
going down to the text color option in

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,870
the bottom there I want to keep it white

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,570
and then I'll just copy paste some more

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,350
text just to fill out a bit a couple

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,300
more quotes and there we have some kind

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,030
of layout and you see that I'm actually

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:57,640
able to resize the columns then again

00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,150
too much flexibility for 95% of the

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,780
cases you know but we are able to do

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:09,670
something about that as well so this is

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:12,420
my page built by Gutenberg Corps blocks

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,420
only

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:22,890
so who's using this it's quite new for

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,020
our sake and in general but still out

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,720
there on the internet there are millions

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,950
of sites using Gutenberg already and

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,910
that's some of the benefits and

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,910
strengths for it

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,610
however in in this session we will have

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,160
a look at UNICEF Norway which is our

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,350
client it's been on Drupal for several

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,360
several years and their production site

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,790
is actually on Drupal 7 currently what

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,220
we're working on that will not talk

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,290
about their strategies or their numbers

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,350
in this session but their user

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,530
experience they have a communication

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,410
department of somewhere between 5 and 15

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:04,560
and 20 people that will work on their

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,170
website content on a regular basis and

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,210
they are competent people which needs

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,660
flexibility to build the landing pages

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:17,670
that they need and tell tell their story

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:19,710
through rich content now what they don't

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,100
want to do in that department is

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:28,620
graphical design that they have other

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,350
people to do so that was the teaser will

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,390
soon get into the details my name is

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,070
Thor I work in front come as a

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,710
consultant and team leader

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm also the leader of the drupal norway

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,920
association and with me i have my friend

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,230
and colleague mark oh yeah hello I'm

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,260
Marco I'm a senior developer and

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,630
architect in front comm and the lead

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,160
developer for the maintainer for the

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,380
gutenberg module

00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:01,040
yes so from coming in general we are an

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,680
open source coming up insurance company

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,910
meaning that we also do frameworks like

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,610
larval and symphony also WordPress sites

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:15,600
nodejs and even mobile applications in

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,150
addition to of course Drupal we are on

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,800
innovation oriented company which among

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,990
other things has resulted in the work

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,350
that we did porting the Guttenberg

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:28,270
editor from the WordPress community and

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:31,930
two more CMS ignore

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:34,990
the solution we are about fifty five

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:38,610
people spread across these countries and

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,460
Norway Portugal where Marco is from

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:47,380
Poland and Germany

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:51,400
okay back to UNICEF let's take a look in

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,120
the setter that they currently have what

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,270
we see here

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,330
typically in the top is some kind of

00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:01,330
hero block it has a background image it

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:06,250
has a title and small teaser text and

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:08,290
the link a button so let's show an

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:17,380
example how we could use that for other

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:19,270
kind of contents so here we go so here

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,110
will not have another background image I

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:25,480
can choose to use a new one you see that

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:29,020
there are some people there in front

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,730
cone Frederick's the office and I can go

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,970
straight in and edit the title

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,610
for that I could do the same of course

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:41,880
with the button I just go in and select

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,880
my text and overwrite it as I would like

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:50,560
below that I had that link URL field so

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,160
again if I choose here to go for

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,870
straight for the demo site I can do that

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,420
that's actually the site you could test

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,460
by the way if you want to do a demo and

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,190
then we have some options here in the

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:07,840
sidebar where I can turn fields on and

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:10,570
off to be able to do proper comparisons

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,330
and examples we are kind of focusing on

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:16,630
the hero banner block today this is

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,840
another example of that with some

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:23,380
slightly different options notice for

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,070
example the focal point image down there

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,640
in the corner

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:31,660
where I could easily select some part of

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,580
that image and that would live update

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,980
the background image for the actual book

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:41,200
a couple of other projects here is a

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,290
similar kind of hero image

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,260
for the Norwegian Children's Cancer

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:51,430
Association which was launched launched

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,410
recently and another example here with

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,360
you know more flexibility which

00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,430
basically require more from the content

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,890
editors and but it's both built on a

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,680
good merge in production and actually

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,080
each of these two sites one two

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,740
different splash of word prices in the

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,540
Norwegian splash words earlier this year

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:19,170
so let's get into the best practices of

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:22,900
how we work with good market how this

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,810
this is a couple of lists of the

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:31,330
Gutenberg core blocks and as we speak

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,490
people are working on hooks to enable to

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,770
extend them and the functionality can

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,620
already be kind of replaced with

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,770
JavaScript on the theme or in a custom

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,290
module so what we see here to the left

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,490
are all you know the regular kind of

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,640
blocks that you could add to your

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,320
content out of the box we usually turn a

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,800
few of this off just because we don't

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,800
need them and just reduce complexity and

00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,370
to the right here we have a long long

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,800
list of embed solutions that just works

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,350
out of the box so for example here you

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,290
can see that I've turned on YouTube

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,440
Twitter Facebook and Vimeo which

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,870
basically mean that I in my page built

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,959
on Guttenberg can just paste a URL to

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,360
that and it will load that tweet in a

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,890
nice way or the video so you can play

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:29,290
that straight into the editor for

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:31,780
example okay the point of this slide is

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,890
simply to say that you know if people

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:39,250
can do something you know someone will

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:43,330
so even if someone here thought that it

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,520
was both fresh and awesome I am not sure

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,760
if I disagree and the designer probably

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,090
won't either so let's talk a bit about

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,090
that

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,120
let's say that you want to build some

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:05,080
kind of grid like this what we're seeing

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:07,710
here I will just start that video this

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,870
is how it's supposed to be looking and

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:14,260
what we usually do then is to try to use

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:18,070
some coal box first and experiment a bit

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:21,070
with that so I'll just try to build it

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,770
I start by our columns block I need

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,840
three columns here and then I can go

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,950
into each and every one of them and just

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,110
paste some content and I'll basically

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,550
just do that for the three columns here

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,860
so what we're looking at exactly is a

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,990
group book in the background which I can

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,940
set a background color to and then

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,070
there's an icon on the top which in this

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,090
case it's just an image and there is a

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,280
paragraph and there's a button so yeah

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,290
we've sort of come quite a long way with

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,410
this but you can also see that it's very

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:59,290
very easily breakable it doesn't look

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,300
like the kind of interface we want and

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:08,080
it's really not the kind of flexibility

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:09,790
that we actually need so let's look at

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,000
how we solve that after having some

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,800
dialogue back and forth well you need an

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,080
icon selector in the top there you can

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,870
see there's icons in all of the three

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,320
columns and instead of having like a

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,660
live search or a huge list of icons we

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,840
could simply take their library of icons

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,720
which is probably 200 and create some UI

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,500
like this you click it and it live

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,790
updates immediately they have categories

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,320
for that so you can say that there is a

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,600
lot of icons to choose from

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,670
basically the same thing goes with for

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,410
example here the background colors if I

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,560
scroll a bit down I can see like a a

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,600
very basic preview on how that looks and

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,880
when I click it you see that it

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,700
immediately updates the actual content

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,140
that I'm working on of course I can do

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,640
things here like going in and change

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,440
texts as we can with any other block

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,470
notice here though that most of the

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,510
fields down here

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,940
they don't have any formatting options

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,830
it's supposed to be strict and the

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,530
people in this company they agree with

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,750
that they want them to follow the design

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:24,169
principles and the design guide that is

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:27,260
made for the site now here's a kind of

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:31,390
other example I'm just gonna start that

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,520
and then post it here you see like a

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:38,530
traditional regular slider it slides

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,780
automatically and if we consider that

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:45,320
yeah we want our Vivek thatas you know

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:48,559
very close to the real life situation we

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,679
quickly get into a situation where it's

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:56,600
not ideal to work on a moving slide show

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:59,299
and also if we have like more than five

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,570
six seven slides to this kind of slide

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:08,450
show it's gonna be very difficult to

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:09,530
navigate in that so when we load this we

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,260
typically add something like this

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,120
instead you can see a preview of the

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,730
four different slides that we have in

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,179
this case and then you can sort of open

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,909
one of them hit pop up pops up I can go

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,669
in and do my edits and then sort of just

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:27,919
close it down again when I'm ready so

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:35,350
that's different from the VC vague

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:39,460
approach but it has good intentions so

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,460
should we go into the tech details

00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:54,750
so let's look at how to build a custom

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:58,020
block okay so Drupal Gutenberg comes

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:00,540
with an example module containing an

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:06,780
example walk just to show you how to get

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:09,660
started click here so going through my

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,770
site folders I find the example module

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:17,010
block module here at Gutenberg module

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,650
folder modules and then I just I can

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,930
just copy this example block folder to

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:27,890
another folder into the Drupal site

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:34,290
modules folder and that's just rename it

00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:38,010
okay and since this is a module also we

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:44,850
also need to rename the configuration

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:47,190
files yeah another thing we need to do

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:53,700
is go to the Gutenberg configuration

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:56,160
file and also do some renaming okay that

00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,380
will actually create a new Java module

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,870
right that can be enabled and disabled

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,960
but that doesn't mean that we need a new

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:10,470
triple module for each block we can have

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,900
kind of a library of blocks in one

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:18,420
module sorry okay so let's have a look

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,050
at this block in the editor here's how

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,530
it works

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:28,320
first we just insert at the block and

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:31,050
here have a title subtitle text and yeah

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,640
help text that's only visible when

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:39,620
editing the block just a specific

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,620
functionality commended for this block

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:52,250
but now let's change this lot a bit now

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,830
the module works even with the

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,840
package.json name example this is

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,630
because they called the codes we cloned

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,130
from the example block is ready already

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:09,430
compiled let's rename it and yeah a name

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,430
for the package and run the npm install

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:17,420
what this will do is install all the

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:23,510
JavaScript and the CSS build files or

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:32,030
build tools and what I want to do in

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:36,770
this block is stick a bit and it's done

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:38,870
I want to yeah remove this image on the

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:43,670
right side also the alt text and maybe

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:45,290
just increase the title font a bit to

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:50,270
find the source of this block we go to

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:55,160
the index.js file at ggs folder a block

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:58,400
is made of these attributes also we have

00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:04,070
this edit function it returns basically

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,740
a component that will handle it wooden

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:10,640
components that will be handled on the

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:15,290
editor and at the bottom we also can

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,530
which is a new category blocks also

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:21,860
contains some styling here at the size

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:25,460
folder we typically had layout styling

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:29,200
on the block itself but global styling

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,190
like fonts colors and elements will be

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,190
defined in the theme

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:48,990
okay so let's start editing the GS file

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:58,590
and change our clock so we are editing

00:25:48,990 --> 00:26:05,760
here on the settings giving it some

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:09,140
description we can also set an icon for

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,240
the block just not here Gutenberg

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:16,590
library already comes bundled with a

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:21,440
library set of icons we can use those or

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:25,200
you can use your own custom icon there

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,970
okay so that's done let's go to the

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,500
bottom and edit the the title font size

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:40,290
in this case we'll just change it to h1

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:47,130
heading 5 and let's remove the right

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:49,920
side call you and also we need to do

00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,820
this for the save components so this is

00:26:49,920 --> 00:27:04,410
where the HTML will be rendered so we'll

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:07,560
change the remove all right so I want

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:11,460
also to create a new category that will

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:14,360
be available on the blocks list let's

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,360
call it awesome

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:28,010
and yeah that's pretty much it just need

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:32,280
to save the file compile the GS codes

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:35,730
transpile running the build script just

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:40,320
takes a couple of seconds and let's test

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:42,930
the block as you can see here we have

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:50,690
the new category awesome here's our

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,690
block alright that's just ready to use

00:27:51,470 --> 00:28:05,300
text there okay some more text sorry the

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,300
guy who made this video with a bit slow

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:14,600
having a great time all right

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,600
we'll just save the note

00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:24,009
and though it is simple yeah good stuff

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:37,170
so what about dynamic content if you

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,880
want within your page some view maybe or

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:44,100
other things coming in is it possible

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,100
yes totally it works like a charm

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,040
all Drupal views are available in good

00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,650
Mergui actually all Drupal box you just

00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,060
need to activate those views on the

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,350
content type that you want it to be

00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:02,700
available for Gutenberg and actually a

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,980
way to set parameters to blocks is work

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,280
in progress currently not fully done yet

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,000
but things are coming so you can do that

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,430
sort of straight in the block itself

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,890
okay so now we just want to cover a

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:22,380
couple of frequently asked questions

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:25,320
that we have gotten from you guys so the

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,860
first one is like yeah what kind of

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,890
sites do you recommend this for well we

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,380
recommend it for large sites with lots

00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,300
of content and editors the huge sites

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,870
besides with so many people that you

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:44,760
know it gets really expensive and hard

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:48,420
to sort of train maintain keep

00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:52,290
everything up to date but also for

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,650
smaller sites of course it works mmm

00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:58,260
does it provide too much flexibility

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:01,470
well we've seen example of that it does

00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,950
that but the answer is no because that's

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,630
you know before it's actually set up

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,360
this is actually the place where you're

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,820
able to properly do something about that

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,010
so exactly the parameters you want

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:18,170
design the backend so it works

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:22,260
flawlessly can it work with workflows

00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:26,520
sure can we use it with the other

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,320
modules or if we switch module later do

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,270
we have to rebuild things stuff like

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,180
that

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:35,600
it generally handles that very well even

00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,740
if you turn off the module and

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,799
deactivated

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,070
the content will still be there as

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,919
Merkel mentioned some styling and may

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,840
come from the block itself but that's

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,640
typically layout things so you could

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,570
just move that styling over to your

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,500
theme instead and you're ready to go is

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:02,789
it secure yes it's just a secure as

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,659
Drupal itself and does it really scale

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:08,730
the performance of this it told lithos

00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,529
the data we store here is easily

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,370
cacheable there are a few days version

00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:16,740
database requests and if you use cloud

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,299
blocks you'll actually get CloudFlare

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,539
see the end straight out of the box

00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:26,490
which is basically serving data faster

00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:29,700
than most websites out there so let's

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,010
just have a quick look now at the work

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,309
going into getting work module since we

00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:38,159
started this is basically a list of the

00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:40,890
releases that we've had for the drupal

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,409
Gutenberg module so before the track

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,970
record here we started the actual

00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:50,220
Gutenberg jas work porting the library

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:54,390
and here you can see that we've had

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:59,370
quite a lot of releases and the stable

00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:01,260
release 1.0 was in the end of May so

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:05,130
it's basically just four months ago and

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,090
we had a stable release and we already

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:14,130
have more than 800 production sites out

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:18,000
there using this so the release cycle

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:22,529
here is about roughly every two weeks

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,640
when we have a new update and there is

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:28,230
actually one more release coming since I

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,240
made this slide but you know where

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,240
should I put that so I just left it

00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:40,789
short term roadmap yeah I can see it's

00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:43,080
like a mirror all you guys sitting here

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:45,320
let's talk a bit about the new exciting

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,760
things that we were planning I had

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,980
currently we are working hard to have a

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,179
full integration with media and the

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,320
media library

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:57,539
and that fits well with what is being

00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,830
shipped with the Drupal 8 eight as Chris

00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:04,529
was mentioning this morning we already

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:07,499
have that available in the dev branch if

00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,989
you want to play around with it and

00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:14,479
another exciting thing but we're

00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:18,779
planning is to include page templates

00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:20,489
coupled with field mapping let's quickly

00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,509
go into what that is about

00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:24,089
there is also a couple of other

00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:28,589
interesting things here if you will know

00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:31,169
more reach out after the session yeah

00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:35,549
just a quick word on the page templates

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:38,820
and field mapping let's say we have a

00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:41,609
simple article structure that has title

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,399
you know teaser text a featured image

00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:48,539
and a body field to freely add the

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,359
content with this new feature in the

00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:56,429
Gutenberg it will be possible to have a

00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:58,919
template for a content type like this so

00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:00,899
here when creating a new article the

00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,809
editor just needs to fill out those

00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:07,440
fields those blocks without worrying

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:11,099
about the layout and then we could

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,520
actually map those blocks to Drupal

00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,819
fields using the upcoming field mapping

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,819
feature

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:28,889
so in the end we just want to show you

00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:33,060
one last example of typical hero block

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:35,550
as we talked about earlier this one

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,139
specifically also has like a background

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:41,970
image and some text fields and button

00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:47,060
they needed a couple variations for

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:47,060
setting different background based on

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:55,379
screens and also a way to move the tight

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:59,040
box there either to the left or center

00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:02,339
or right apart from that it's the same

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,140
apart from this little feature when you

00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,750
click use video as background it

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,480
actually instantly fetches the video

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:12,150
straight from Vimeo and I'm still able

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,800
to work on the content you know on top

00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:20,760
of that and I'm if I paste a new ID it

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,210
instantly and fetches a new video

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:28,020
Vimeo in this case and you can just keep

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,210
going after that and this is of course

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,470
very nice for these people that are

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,119
actually working on building this

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,460
content they can focus on their wording

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,930
and you know how to place things without

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:42,210
going so much back and forth between

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:46,619
preview and and the editor and we

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:49,080
basically see that usually you spend

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,060
like ten to ten two percent of the time

00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,130
that you usually do to build like

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,900
landing pages and content if you think

00:35:53,130 --> 00:36:00,300
about just the process of creating

00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:06,990
building the pages yes so that's about

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:09,390
it we have it's open for questions if

00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,790
you guys have any questions and we'll

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:17,540
also have birds of a feather session

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:20,550
right now after this session in G 110

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,980
which is basically our sort of pre

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,650
speaking questions questions and answers

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,380
session so we can go into more details

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,150
if you're interested so are there any

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,839
questions and Marco we you need to stay

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,839
closer because

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:39,970
yeah I was wondering how the data is

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:42,760
actually stored so if editors like build

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,320
these pages in such a way and they want

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,750
to migrate the website in five years

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,630
time is it like one filled with all the

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:53,140
data in it or does it store it in fields

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,360
or whatever yeah it's it's stored in one

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,540
field basically the body field because

00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,340
it's basically just an editor and so

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,710
that makes it very easy to move that

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,260
along later and that's also why you can

00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,790
sort of turn off the module and the

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,370
content will still be there and up

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,420
running and working but I can imagine

00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,390
like the queue if you want to migrate

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,370
for example coach to a new field in in

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:21,460
the new website it might be difficult if

00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:23,260
it's stored in one field Wow that gets

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,390
the benefit for a module such as

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,560
paragraphs I would say where all the

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,710
fields have their own place in the

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,550
database yeah you would of course need

00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,920
to to map it and to make it work but

00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,960
like all the other kinds of stuff that

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,380
you put in term for example views like

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,760
we mentioned that would be like a

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,230
dynamic reference anyway and of course

00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,090
the really interesting part is what

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,850
Marco talked about the fields mapping

00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,560
and this is where you actually are able

00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,050
to put that kind of specific data

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,480
straight into this and it will actually

00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:05,710
save on a separate field so we have that

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:11,790
full structure for those cases hello yes

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:18,580
do you support node translations yeah

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:21,190
okay do you support a visions the

00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:25,320
guttenberg blocks out of the box do you

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:28,990
have any control over the HTML output

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,320
like in paragraphs you can alter the

00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:36,640
twigs or you can alter the HTML but can

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:41,410
you alter the HTML Gutenberg books well

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:45,080
you kind of could replace easily one

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:47,660
core block outputs by replacing all

00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,300
but currently the Guttenberg community

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:54,530
is working on some kind of a hooks

00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:58,340
system for blocks that you you know you

00:38:54,530 --> 00:39:03,320
could easily just change the output of a

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:07,640
block even core blocks okay okay that's

00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,440
it thank you thank you hi would it be

00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,540
possible to use it alongside play

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:19,310
Abdullah and would it make any sense at

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:20,660
all you you can of course do that we

00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:24,200
haven't done that yet we've been

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:35,360
experimenting a bit with it but it's of

00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:38,960
course possible but yeah yes during the

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,800
demo you use on the body field what

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,220
happened if we use other field to set

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,770
some metadata that will be used in the

00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,190
different views and so on yes sorry we

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:55,130
shouldn't have that in our demo

00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:58,100
basically the other fields that you need

00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,290
on your nodes that could be a lot of

00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,630
stuff of course you have the option to

00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:05,150
either put them in the sidebar so like

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,520
on the arrow two tabs there one for

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,950
block specific settings and another tab

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,630
in the sidebar for document settings and

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,420
that's where you keep it like some

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,720
fields for other fields that may require

00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,940
more space typically and those will be

00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,760
added below the standard to get

00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:28,000
merganser so we have like a more option

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,000
further down the list thank you

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,039
any other questions okay

00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:51,459
so thank you guys it's as we mentioned

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,670
there will be above in g110 where we can

00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:56,670
