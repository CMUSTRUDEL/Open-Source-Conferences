I'll monitor with my wife and see iPad

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,880
here and then maybe maybe in questions

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,300
here and then later you can have

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,230
questions also by demonic but let's get

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,270
to the to the discussion so the first

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,750
topic we have three topics here so first

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,580
topic is why do we want to grow that is

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,890
the question so panelist in in a

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,080
preformed order what is the what is the

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,060
business reason why you want to grow or

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,740
what was the defining moment you you

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:17,110
found out that you actually want to grow

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:22,660
and why so not actually sure I do it's a

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:25,780
joke so um so I think for for phase two

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,020
the the initial first five years of our

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,930
company was very small we had no growth

00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,880
plans and no growth path and I think it

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,250
took a while for us to understand we

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,410
were a business and I think that's

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,550
really the key defining point is once

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,430
she realized that the point of a

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,580
business is actually to make money you

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,850
learn that by figuring out that model

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,490
and that engine and then scaling it

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,700
appropriately I think you you earn more

00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,190
profit for your shareholders so there's

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,770
an economic reason the other part about

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,900
it is just opportunity once you get good

00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,880
at doing something I think you want to

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,920
be able to replicate that and you hire

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,910
people that take a lot of pride in

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:15,340
enjoyment in delivering success and then

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,890
want to do more it's addictive I would

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,690
also actually say be sure you want to

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,160
grow because it's it's not something

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,030
that that you'll definitely need to do

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,880
being

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,380
a mall freelancer is a pretty sweet

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,220
place to be yet but you can't do all

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,020
sorts of stuff and and basically one of

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,820
the primary reasons for growing is to be

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,950
able to do different kinds of projects

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,010
for different kind of customers and go

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,110
to places you wouldn't otherwise that

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,940
said it's it's a really like a balanced

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,620
question and like do you wanna grow and

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,300
how big do you want to be because your

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,560
your life and business changes quite a

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,780
bit when you keep on growing I think

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,340
certainly for me is a founder it's been

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,140
interesting to understand I think why

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,810
grow is a really important question when

00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,590
you're moving from being a freelancer or

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,760
kind of as you go through those

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,470
different points because your job will

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,360
change if you're at the top of that kind

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,860
of pyramid and understanding what you

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,820
want to be doing day-to-day and why I

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,110
think it's quite important because

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,850
otherwise you can end up with a business

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,700
plan that doesn't really reflect the

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,990
reality of what you want to achieve

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,850
we've grown quite organically so we

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,010
haven't had any acquisitions and I think

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,450
it's been good because it's allow us to

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,040
align to opportunity as well and

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,630
certainly part of the driver of that has

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,790
been to take on more kind of interesting

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,140
opportunities or clients or skills that

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,000
feels like we can do better and better

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,410
work and kind of a think in line with

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,570
that that's allowed us to keep

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,400
optimizing the business to to work out

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,080
kind of those blue chip clients so it's

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,310
certainly something that we did badly

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,930
and didn't really understand at the

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,460
start and I think of as we've learned

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,130
those from those mistakes to understand

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,330
where you need that clarity it's been

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,550
important to kind of get better and

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:51,970
better at that I think the reason that

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,470
we've grown is partly that we've won

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,390
bigger and bigger projects as time has

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,979
gone on and realized that we're quite

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,060
good at servicing these large clients

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,560
but in order to do that we've had to get

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,750
subject matter experts in certain areas

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,320
like scalability or migration or

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,750
accessibility and in order to do that

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,330
you have to have a certain size and to

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:19,960
be able to attract those and expensive

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,690
specialists thank you let's do a quick

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,419
quick call up from the from the audience

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,950
so how many of you are working alone in

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:32,440
a single man entity single woman entity

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,770
less than five people or 55 or less

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,770
people

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:48,290
less than 10 people less than 20 people

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:54,169
less than 50 people less than 100 more

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:58,669
than hundred more than thousand okay so

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:03,770
there's still plenty room to grow good

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:06,020
so what's the benefit of growth or grow

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,400
into your to the clients what the

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,350
clients get when you grow so I think the

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,560
client gets a lot this is definitely

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,660
something that we utilize to our

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,630
advantage in the sales cycle we talked

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,389
to clients about the like Paul said the

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:26,000
ability to bring specialists to the team

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:30,290
that a smaller organization couldn't

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,050
afford so we can take a full breath set

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:36,950
of experiences from strategy and design

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:41,330
through content strategy UX development

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:43,640
you know get into deployment DevOps and

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,340
infrastructure scalability and all that

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,020
so so we can deliver a very broad set of

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,260
services and I think that's a great

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,060
selling point for some clients however I

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,620
think there's a point at which size

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,340
becomes you hit a point of diminishing

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,050
return and so we try to target ourselves

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,780
and imagine ourselves fitting the sweet

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,870
spot between you know I call it the

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,130
Goldilocks strategy right so you had the

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,840
three little bears you know and this

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,000
one's this bed's too small and this

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,870
bed's too big and three little bears I'm

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,080
mixing my I think I'm mixing my my my

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,340
fairy tales but uh so you know the four

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
I'll go with the porridge right the

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,150
forage was too hot the forage was too

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
cold this one's just right right so we

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,560
see ourselves as being large enough to

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,330
deliver all those services but not so

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,870
large that we've reached you know an

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,640
accenture IBM you know we won department

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,380
doesn't talk to each other and we create

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
bureaucracies sort of thing so we're

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,969
targeting that sweet spot for clients in

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,830
between yeah what do we really the

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,480
reason for four founding wound across

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,440
really was was quite simple it was

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,560
customer demand

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,830
so customers were really looking to to

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,890
get a international vendor who would be

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,660
able to service them globally or

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,460
European white or whatever it may be for

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,930
four different customers but they wanted

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,540
to have a vendor that is small and agile

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,750
and flexible not a very easy thing to do

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,850
and very few companies have managed to

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,550
do it and that's one of the reasons why

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,650
why we ended up being what we are today

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,440
being like small and flexible and not

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,300
even trying to be one of the elephant's

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,180
like i.t elephants we don't want to be

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,700
an IBM really we want to be able to be

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,040
flexible and move quick and change and

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,470
two different stuff and also do stuff

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,450
differently from from time to time so

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,790
that that really was was the primary

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:39,740
reason for for getting started yeah

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,140
we've certainly been finding a sweet

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,850
spot of where agent our clients have

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,680
been either short listing or selecting

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,050
mr. pitch on this basis that were not so

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,520
big we're not kind of a wpp group tens

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,440
of thousands of people agency but we're

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,700
not too small an agency that they feel

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,140
like the size of the project is a

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,450
commercial risk for them based on our

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,790
turnover and I think part of that sweet

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,050
spot has been around having those

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,340
specialist services like user experience

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,620
or content strategy or some of those

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,330
things that smaller agencies can't have

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,290
and it feels risky to the client for

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,980
them to be brought in on a freelance

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,840
basis but not be a huge agency that they

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,220
start to feel like even as a as a kind

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,750
of a very large pharmaceutical client

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,130
for example even at that size that

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,660
they're not really that valuable to them

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,610
based on billions of Billings and I

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,410
think within the kind of ripple

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,850
community and the agencies that are out

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,040
there seems to be a kind of an emerging

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,050
opportunity for kind of big enough to to

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,790
take on big jobs but not so huge that

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,620
they're they're kind of those Network

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,420
agency sized companies where clients are

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,130
just really sick of kind of not having

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,720
that customer service or people paying

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,580
attention or high staff turnover and

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,050
we've certainly been winning business on

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,020
the basis I think of being able to do

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,460
full service on those jobs but not be so

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,180
big that they kind of feel impersonal

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,250
even to a really large client I suppose

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,080
for CTI and one of the big things was

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,270
that we needed to be large enough to be

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,910
able to service organizations like the

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,740
government enterprise and then large

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,100
public sector bodies that they do

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,690
require a certain scale and

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,829
and as partly through things like

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,410
resilient so sickness absence and we're

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:10,000
also more people need to got better

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,430
availability to resource so we can plan

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,540
around their changing requirements we

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,279
can also achieve a higher velocity

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,500
that's not just because you've got more

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,500
hands on deck it can mean that we've got

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,050
specialist roles so through the full

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,329
project lifecycle so we have people who

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,009
are satisfying the kind of climb

00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,720
relationship and sales and then we have

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,670
people who specialize in planning and

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,319
then you've got separate teams for

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,060
development and then the support and in

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,100
life services that's been a really

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,360
important thing for us to kind of

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,279
segment those because it we found the

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,110
development team were being pulled in to

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,000
support aspects from being pulled of

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:50,709
projects and now that we have these two

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:56,620
to sort of finite roles yeah it's a much

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:58,540
more productive environment okay so we

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,550
can we talk a lot about sweets but so

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,680
hands in the air question for the panel

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:09,880
is that who is currently at the sweet

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:12,880
spot below the sweet spot above the

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,500
sweet spot when it certainly in the

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,009
northwest of the UK there are quite a

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,920
few examples of companies that have

00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,810
taken that bridge between 50 and 100 and

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,120
we're kind of at 50 ish at the moment

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,069
it's a very dangerous gap to take you

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,480
have to introduce extra layers of

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:33,670
management and you become the

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,139
profitability sort of wayne's during

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,079
that period and there have been plenty

00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:40,329
of agencies who have folded during

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,819
during that journey so I'd say we're at

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:45,639
that sweet spot about to take a leap of

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,380
faith yeah you always the challenges

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,269
keep on changing when you grow there's

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,100
always the next thing and people say you

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,589
know it's difficult to go from painters

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,569
when do you know 5200 or whatever it's

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,949
difficult to go from one to two it's

00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,380
it's it's always just a different

00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,970
challenge than what you face and in our

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,180
case for example the challenge right now

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,189
is like time zones we get like without

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,170
doing any proper size we get like us

00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,389
customers who want to come in and all of

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,130
our stuff is based in Europe which is a

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,470
massive challenge on how to manage that

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,240
because we know we don't want to keep

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,800
working in the middle of the night so

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,790
there's always the next thing whatever

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:26,730
it may be so it's a fleeting sweet spot

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:28,350
then really really quick answers this is

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,540
important question so a couple of words

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,970
only and starting from theme this time

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,920
that what's the value of the growth for

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,940
the staff I think learning opportunities

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:47,160
probably if you want two words yeah yes

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:48,240
bigger party's ability to specialize in

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,620
something that you're really passionate

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:58,620
about I think those would all be mine

00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:01,380
all those are better for staff excellent

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,080
and then the next topic that we know now

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,240
that why we want to grow for the

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,050
fleeting sweet spot so the the next one

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,660
is how do we grow and let's take a first

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,240
the once again hands in the air for the

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,360
panelists that did you have you grown

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,790
organically all those that have grown

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,680
organically hands there with there will

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,430
be more of the kinetics yeah you can you

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,780
can answer to the several so have you

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:32,700
grown through mergers and acquisitions

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:37,470
have you grown using extensively

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:40,050
freelance networks okay we have one that

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,010
used to all the free something else that

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:47,490
I have missed okay that was like hosting

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,740
then so let's let's go to the planning

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,840
question that how do you plan growth or

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,360
do you do does it just happen that did

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,980
suddenly you found out that you are zero

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,910
of two hundred people company will have

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:03,000
you actually made a plan and forward it

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,530
so so in our case we started to get real

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,530
growth when we made a plan and followed

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,450
it believe it or not so you know we

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,480
started a budgeting cycle and the

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,880
budgeting looks at headcount and it

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,500
looks at profit margins and it works

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,740
backwards to try to make sure that we

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,900
achieve a net profit and then it

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,920
essentially established as a growth path

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,030
based upon what we think we can sell so

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,130
it's a it's a difficult

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,310
problem obviously you have to factor in

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,940
what you can sell the size that you want

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,670
to be and what you how you can recruit

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,100
qualified people and so we we did

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,160
achieve this year our growth plan and

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:49,320
then at the end of the year we seized an

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:52,550
opportunity to do another small not

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,770
acquisition technically an aqua higher

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,260
but we that was outside of our growth

00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,530
plan but we looked at it as an advance

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,600
against a better hiring decisions than

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,280
we would have made next year so we had

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,110
an opportunity to get a really great

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,700
team and we took it at the end of the

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,970
year but it was when we were literally

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,100
at I think almost exactly at the number

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,150
it was the literal number that we were

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,220
supposed to be out for the end of the

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,680
year so we were there early and then we

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,220
said ah screw it let's just get another

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,770
14 and add it on so the plan is very

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,660
helpful but you always have to I guess

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,510
allow yourself the ability to deviate

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:36,000
from the plan to seize opportunity yeah

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,890
it's good to have goals we have rolling

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,080
goals usually so it's not like an annual

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,460
budgeting of planning cycle it's more

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,130
like well this is what we are going to

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,590
do next kind of thing and and it's also

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,830
like ongoing and rolling and kind of a

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,070
moving target you mostly grow sales

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,480
first because of the nature of the

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,640
business you need to have the sales to

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,950
support the growth and then for example

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,690
we are always hiring like at any given

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,330
time if we find the right person we

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,370
always hire them and then the sales

00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:10,290
follows also so i would say sales first

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,570
whenever possible but if you find great

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:16,260
people that work with also you know

00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:18,180
follow those people my acquisitions are

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,040
tricky but i guess that's a separate

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:25,050
topic I think there's certainly kind of

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,910
an ongoing cycle mentality you need to

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,200
be it's just as important to concentrate

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,210
on your sales as your delivery

00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,280
infrastructure and classically agencies

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,140
struggle when they oversell but don't

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,580
have the processes or people to keep

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,680
delivering and you can end up with quite

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,970
kind of a a turnover and headcount graph

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,210
that would just keep tipping up and down

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,919
unless you can understand

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,539
and as your head count grows that your

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,899
problems will keep changing in terms of

00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:48,640
management infrastructure or process you

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,929
know the sales stuff is is a kind of a

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,970
completely different problem I think too

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,529
often agencies smaller agencies haven't

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,270
had to have dedicated sales teams and I

00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,799
found sales teams and business

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,529
development is quite a complex thing to

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,669
manage compared to project delivery with

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,080
and other things which you have to do

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,940
all the time even as a kind of very

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,039
small agency and I think recognizing

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,159
those different challenges in managing

00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,299
them specifically to their nature so not

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,190
trying to treat sales teams as

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,450
development teams and etc is quite

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,649
important to understand and break up

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,049
your business that way because it's easy

00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:21,669
to kind of fall into nasty traps that

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:27,279
catch you out later am I supposed says

00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:29,169
CT ice some advice would be make sure

00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,549
you're selling the right projects know

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:31,779
what you're good at and don't

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,480
necessarily go for every single

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,820
opportunity that comes along we do have

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,380
a long-term plan and I think it's

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,450
important that you have a management

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,909
team team and also your staff bought

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,159
into that plan and so they echoes

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,230
throughout the business and two years

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,350
ago it's fair to say that that wasn't

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,929
the case in our company and we shrank

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,460
and because some of the management team

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,070
work trying to pull the business in a

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,890
different direction and it had quite a

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,990
negative impact and to resonate what

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,750
Jeff has been saying yeah you need to

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:07,240
kind of always be appraising things and

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,450
be opportunistic so that may that be

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,890
through hiring or there may be and the

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,659
next big project that you think you

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,260
should go for because it's good for the

00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:19,059
long-term plan excellent there's a

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,270
question from the audience so the at

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:23,230
least somebody's awake there so they are

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,390
there's question that would it make

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,070
sense for small agents do hire dedicated

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,200
be sacked development specialist to help

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,990
with the growth so what what's your take

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,289
on that and only if you've got stuff you

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,250
can deliver what they can sell it

00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:41,289
depends what you mean by business

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,190
development specialist if it's a sales

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:47,049
person as it is in the UK fine do it if

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,010
it's really like developing your

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:53,500
business I wouldn't be prepared to hand

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,070
over your company and and sell part of

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,780
it and

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,210
whatever you do it has to be all or

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,060
nothing kind of thing because companies

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,880
need strong leadership and if you try to

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:10,060
like outsource that leadership that's

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,710
not going to go well excellent so we

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,260
have been talking about sales so what is

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,910
the what is the I guess that the

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,000
improved sales is the key to growth that

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,530
you get more money in so how do you get

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,420
the new client so how do you evaluate

00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,420
the markets where you want to expand

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,070
sure um yes I think first and foremost

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,140
having market specialization or strategy

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,170
to go after something specific is

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,800
critical because if you can't be able to

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,900
tell your staff whether the dedicated

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,120
sales people are not dedicated sales

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,460
people if you can't point out a specific

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,140
target and focus and say that's how and

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,490
where we're going to grow and that's

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,800
what the kind of work we're interested

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,420
in doing then you're essentially just

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,910
taking what comes to you and if you take

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,100
what comes to you you're you're at the

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,800
mercy of your inbound lead generation

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,900
process and that's demand that you don't

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,520
control and you don't want to be growing

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,230
a business off of demand that you don't

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,680
control because that can turn around on

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:15,280
you if you can say hey I'm only going to

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,350
sell uh you know drupal and I'm only

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,650
going to do it in the UK and I'm only

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,800
going to do it around projects that are

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,720
have a you know philanthropic cause or

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,110
something and I'm making up a very

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,000
specific niche but if you can say that

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,920
and you can hold to that and you can

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,080
demonstrate that to your team and you

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,940
put those growth goals in place as well

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,000
and you say and we're going to go from

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,040
you know 1 million pounds to 4 million

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,020
pounds doing it and here's the research

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,390
and I know we can do it and then you go

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,600
outwards now you have a forward-looking

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,550
a you know a not not a passive sales

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,520
strategy you have you know a more

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:59,980
offensive that's offensive not offensive

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,260
sales strategy

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,169
I'll just add a bit on top of that

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:10,299
basically so whatever he said and also

00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,549
what I see in trouble shops we talk

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,790
about acquisition quite a bit and what I

00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,140
see in most triple shops is like they

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,299
are first of all they're kind of busy

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,220
running with the bicycle because they

00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:23,340
don't have time to learn to how to write

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,620
the bicycle so they run with it instead

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,419
and and the second thing is like they

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,700
don't get to do the stuff that they

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:33,400
would like to do like specialize in a

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,530
niche and do some great stuff because

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,450
they are so busy in in cleaning up their

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,790
messes because they sell whatever just

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,040
to get the next paycheck and that's a

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,620
really really like vicious circle to be

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,620
in so breaking out of that circle

00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,150
somehow and getting to the next level

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,710
and decided hey look you know we don't

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,940
have that many customers for some time

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,710
but at least now we are doing what we

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,929
really want to do and what we are really

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,760
good at and that can be tricky because

00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:59,700
believe it or not people need to have

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,640
their paychecks in order to eat so

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,440
tricky definitely one of the most

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,059
important things we found is that kind

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,490
of deal evaluation work so we've got

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,320
quite kind of a rigorous way of pulling

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,000
apart both the client and the project of

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,350
can it be successful can we be

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,780
successful with it what is the

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,190
commercial context does the client even

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,900
understand what they want to achieve are

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,400
they capable of achieving it what are

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,230
the kind of context of the business risk

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,340
so if you're building something that's

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,690
going to be on kind of national

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,950
television in a week and the client

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,299
doesn't receive what you know that they

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,040
know what they're doing never to be that

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:31,450
flak and backlash is going to come at

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,590
you even if you were really never going

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,419
to kind of succeed and that's going to

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,350
hurt your reputation your profitability

00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,270
you're going to spend a lot of

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,980
management time kind of fighting around

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,320
stuff that was just always a kind of an

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,240
inevitable conclusion so we've kind of

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,429
got better and better at kind of turning

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,110
down as much work as we take on and

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,790
that's really let us focus on where we

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,500
can really go and do an amazing job of

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,000
something that leaves the schedules the

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,320
mindset the people the business

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,580
development all of the process is there

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,530
to kind of do a really good job of the

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,150
things that can we can succeed with and

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,179
sometimes that takes a bit of kind of

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,679
you know kind of steel nerves ready to

00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:03,940
kind of turn down things you think ok

00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,290
well the pipe Martin's not looking great

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,450
we don't have tons of stuff booked in

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,650
but really and this is a blue-chip kind

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,820
of name or something but actually we

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,380
just think this isn't going to work and

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,830
there's

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,270
there's a UK plc who I won't name

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,560
actually be we went through a kind of a

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,490
period of turning down work for them and

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,420
saying actually just don't understand

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,460
these projects we don't think this is

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,840
going to work and actually they've we've

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,610
been working with them having seen those

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,110
projects fails fail with other people

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,940
we've now been working with them for a

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,560
while and we actually got credibility by

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,270
pointing out the kind of flaws in their

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,010
project process to then be invited back

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,780
in outside of a tender just to be

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,860
commissioned to do the work so that was

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,690
kind of gratifying although

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,720
nerve-wracking for that kind of year in

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,060
the middle you know I can resonate that

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,190
there was work that we were we won

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,200
through the British Council and there

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,550
was a get out clause after the discovery

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,530
phase and we accept you used that

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:55,710
opportunity to so we could walk away and

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,210
because the platform that we were going

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,460
to develop upon was there was not

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,740
satisfactory and but the outcome of that

00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,140
was that and we migrated into Drupal 7

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,030
so sometimes you need to be prepared to

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,160
take a brave step and be confident about

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,750
what you're doing but with reference to

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,610
sustainability just like to add that I

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,900
think you should find work which your

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:19,500
team enjoy or they find satisfying valid

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,270
or should also be profitable and buse

00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,040
that the profitability look to your

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,430
previous projects and be honest with

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,410
yourself about how they went and having

00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,420
satisfying work helps with retention of

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,670
your staff that they more like to stay

00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,880
for a long time but always seek out work

00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,680
which sort of compliments to your

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,660
long-term goals that measurement team

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:44,610
out with her already established good

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,410
and then there's other question from the

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,700
related markets from there from the

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:54,860
audience that the world is the large

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,630
enough organization to serve the

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:00,390
government and the enterprise markets

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:05,370
quick answers this would depend a lot on

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:08,490
a country it's it is like say for

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,310
example in any UK the government is

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,460
actively trying to say use SMEs like

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:17,040
small and medium players whereas in in

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,510
markets like say Sweden or Finland or

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,790
whatever it's going to be like if you

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,530
don't have a million employees you can't

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,990
even

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,300
bit for four major project it's really

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,800
varies from country to country in some

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,600
places you need to be one of the big

00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,020
four or five players in order to play

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,720
and in some some markets it's quite the

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,020
opposite so this is highly reliant where

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,740
you operating it how do you get to learn

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,990
that by accidental by bites us trying oh

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:48,350
well you you kind of know it by talking

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:50,180
to local vendors but I guess not many

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,680
companies are trying to actively move to

00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,440
another market so you would know it's

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,620
for your own market probably and I think

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,210
that should be easy for us it's we've

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,970
always just poking through the local

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:05,180
players and know how did it how it is

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,460
and it's easier to determine that for

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,220
the public stuff that's quite simple

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,160
usually for for the private companies

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,050
there may be very different restrictions

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,300
from size there may be like language or

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,400
cultural issues or you're not being

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,110
German now you know whatever the issue

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,820
you actually run into quite a few

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:26,720
different roadblocks when you're trying

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:29,120
to goto into a new market okay and then

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,420
the third section start with the

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,390
sustaining the growth and let's talk

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,690
about stuff we briefly touch this stuff

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,310
but it's a really important important

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,270
topic in the growth that you need to

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:48,350
have people that you can grow so what is

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:52,040
the what is the importance or meaningful

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,660
of the vision and the culture in Europe

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,880
in your organization regarding growth

00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:01,430
let's start from from that side this

00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:03,050
time i would say beyond and yeah what ye

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,230
kind of informs everything that you do

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:09,080
and the way that you conduct

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,330
disciplinary actions yeah if you've got

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,260
issues with the developers or work you

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:17,840
go to win and how people interact with

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,440
one another or on a day-to-day basis the

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,570
culture is it's integral to the whole

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,360
business I can't really emphasize it

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,400
enough and and I think it's something

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,530
that you need to have clearly

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,740
communicated because as you grow you're

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,790
bringing people who perhaps

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,590
yeah you need to make make sure they're

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:39,650
aware of what it is that they're coming

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:43,160
to and so part of your recruitment

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:45,290
process should actually Express the type

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,000
of organization that you are otherwise

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,930
it's going to change and it might not be

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,960
in a manner which is going to contribute

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:58,430
to your sustainability yeah certainly

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,920
think the kind of clarity and

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,450
communication of the 22 to kind of keys

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
that if you don't understand what you're

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,410
going to do is a management team and

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,030
then no one else will for a fact either

00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,980
and if you don't communicate that in a

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,540
way kind of regularly in often then

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,400
other people can't collaborate with you

00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,260
to kind of achieve those goals and I

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,790
think it's something I'm certainly I've

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,200
underestimated in the past the kind of

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,850
thing old isn't obvious what we're doing

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,060
and actually you know to be fair I don't

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,260
think it often is you know the the kind

00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,970
of leadership level of the company I

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,040
think often your kind of moving faster

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,510
and looking at things in a way that not

00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,310
everyone else has the opportunity to and

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,560
I think it's really important to to kind

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,120
of set those goals and then keep

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,250
communicating and collaborating on them

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,110
and working through them and otherwise

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,430
people often you know change is

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,110
something that humans just aren't geared

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,750
up to kind of enjoy and accept without

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,920
kind of having that context for it too

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,570
and I think letting people know where

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,400
you're going and why um is really

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,810
important and can often smooth over

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,430
there kind of humps and bumps that you

00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,050
get with growth where things people's

00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,640
roles change people's processes change

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,950
people's kind of working habits are

00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,060
going to change in that can often be

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,920
more difficult than you anticipate I

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:06,770
think in my experience I largely down to

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,530
the culture culture eats strategy for

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,360
breakfast it doesn't make any difference

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,130
what sort of strategy you have if your

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,770
culture is conflicting with it the

00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:18,140
culture is always going to win so how do

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,790
you how do you create the culture well

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,870
it's a living thing first of all it's

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,550
it's something that went the

00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,860
organization grows and James is the

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,660
culture keeps on changing but you can

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,810
you can do like cultural leadership as

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,370
well mostly by doing the right thing and

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,260
doing the stuff you believing and

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,510
actually a daily actions as a leader

00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,910
have to reflect your your values and

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,000
your vision and your goals and all that

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,220
so you have to be like all the time

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,299
walking to talk basically on daily basis

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,129
and leading from the front line really

00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,259
so that's that's the only way I know how

00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:54,809
to how to create the great culture in a

00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:58,860
company problem with going last is you

00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:01,739
start to forget the question i think it

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,110
was twofold it was the impact of culture

00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:07,320
but also sort of sustained growth right

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,330
and how those are related so i think

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,830
first and foremost you know you can look

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,980
at you can look at growth two ways you

00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:16,409
can look at it as responsive growth

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,109
that's kind of pulled by demand you know

00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:20,909
we got one or two large projects and

00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:24,720
they wanted us to scale up so in

00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:26,070
response to that we added people the the

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,799
problems with that are similar to what i

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,960
said earlier about sales in that that's

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,600
someone else's planned for you not your

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,299
plan for yourself that's being pulled in

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,259
a direction by demand not determining

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,690
you're going to go in that direction

00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:41,669
proactively and those are the situations

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,460
that typically don't last they're not

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:48,480
sustainable growth because the company

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,429
wasn't controlling that destiny and the

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,090
second side of it the other way to do it

00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:56,279
is really in more of a proactive way and

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,279
that's the what tends to be more lasting

00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,529
and more sustainable and the reason is

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,639
because you're focusing hopefully and we

00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,950
haven't mentioned this yet but you're

00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:07,559
hopefully focusing a lot more on scaling

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,570
than growing which is to say you

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,820
actually understand the structure and

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,279
the leverage that the organization needs

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,369
with regards to management and certain

00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,590
skills and talents and resources to go

00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,749
to that next level and stay there and be

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,749
there productively and that's where

00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:26,639
management and leadership become big

00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:29,129
deal because that's when you can

00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:31,259
actually say hey this is there is a

00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:33,749
mission there is a vision for this

00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:36,179
organization there's a strategic plan in

00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:38,940
there's culture and all of those things

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,820
are connected to each other and it's

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,549
done in a planned and organized way if

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,100
you're growing in in response to

00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:49,169
something you don't have time to align

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,210
your mission and your vision in your

00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,490
culture in a way that makes sense to

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,320
those employees so I think they are very

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,710
related it was a good question even

00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,420
though I didn't remember

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,330
okay let's have a short wording from the

00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,310
from the audience so how many of you

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:12,120
think that you know your company's

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:14,820
mission by heart suprising many how many

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:20,330
of you think that you are working in a

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:23,940
growing company even bigger amount and

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:27,210
how many of you think that the deflating

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,560
sweet spot is still ahead of you that

00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,940
you still need to grow the bitter and

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:37,530
sweet spot how many things that you have

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,080
grown already past the sweet spot the

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:44,940
one guy okay we will need to talk with

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,440
you later yeah so we have been talking

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,820
about structures and levels and the

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,950
other so what is the what are the risks

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,720
involved in when you when you sort of

00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,510
step up the operations when you when you

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:03,270
grow to the next level what kind of

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:06,480
things you need to be prepared for start

00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:09,300
down here you you choose I'll go just

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,179
could unwind all right so I think

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,950
there's a there that we could do we

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,330
could do three hours on the topic alone

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:22,139
but I think first and foremost it the

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,649
part of the risk in growing is you start

00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,840
to lose the culture that you had before

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:30,720
and I think you know like vesa said

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,600
focusing on that culture as a primary

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,210
thing has to be your job whoever is the

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,970
CEO your job is to ensure that that

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,790
culture is not affected by your ambition

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:45,330
for growth or you're scaling plans I

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,190
also think that you have to support you

00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,740
have to start to think about the

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,960
infrastructure that in the general sense

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,919
that's required that infrastructure

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,270
includes financial and legal aspects you

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,570
know making sure that you actually have

00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:03,240
the sophistication to do your numbers

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,010
and run it like a business it includes

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,960
sales and marketing making sure that you

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,760
have the ability to sell more work in

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,040
the future it includes management

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,710
of all forms project management product

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,570
management staff management any you know

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,310
that we all tend to think of management

00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,410
is overhead but the reality is is its

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,910
scaffolding for growth it's the

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,980
scaffolding that sits outside the

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,460
organization and ensures that you can

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,930
stack the next layer on top and so

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,060
creating a management structure that

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,650
both enforces the things that you're

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:38,440
doing strategically but isn't a negative

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:41,080
impact on the culture is one of the

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,090
hardest things you can possibly do but

00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,350
it's the most critical it is literally

00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,550
trying to build a building without

00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:51,510
understanding what that structure is so

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:56,080
I think probably the biggest risk is

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:58,570
it's becoming a job or just a job so so

00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,370
basically it no longer it's something

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,500
that your Monday mornings you're really

00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,170
glad that yeah it's great to go to work

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,630
and do all of this great stuff because

00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,580
you have all sorts of hustles and you

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,990
may have even a temptation on copying

00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,820
the big boys on how they run

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,290
corporations because surely they know

00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,420
because they have tens of thousands of

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,040
employees and you could be all of the

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,470
bureaucracy and layers and all these

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,420
like additional crap which part of it

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,040
may be scaffolding like really for

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,960
growth but if it may be just because

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,760
that's the way it's done because that's

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,820
the way they teach you when you do mba

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,490
switch is complete crap if you ask me so

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,160
so all of this may actually turn turn it

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,600
as like work where it's like oh my god

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,960
it's again monday i don't want to go to

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,580
work and that's the biggest risk i think

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,620
it's really important to understand the

00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,000
business in terms of kind of turnover

00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,530
and head count of what is just good

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,570
business and that's nothing to do often

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,970
with kind of being a Drupal agency or an

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,990
agency or anything else I think ensuring

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,450
that you've got the right kind of

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,500
financial or professional advisers kind

00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,390
of proportionate to the work you're

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,730
doing which may have been different when

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,560
you were 10 people on a 50,000 pound

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,270
deal compared to something that's on a

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,800
quarter of a million deal you can find

00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,170
yourself in traps that are far less

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,430
intuitive I think as you start to work

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,110
with larger and larger clients or on

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,430
riskier projects and I think kind of

00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,690
studying your business and studying

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,580
businesses at the same size to

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,050
understand and what are the kind of some

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,850
of the techniques and it could be around

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,200
tax it could be around liability there's

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,800
lots of things that kind of keep

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,790
shifting as you go through and

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,980
ensuring that your kind of paying

00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,330
attention outside of the the kind of

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,460
agency space because lots of these

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,590
things apply to and businesses of those

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,000
size regardless of their type and not

00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,620
kind of getting too stuck into kind of

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,260
the just what kind of goes around

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,490
amongst your immediate peers or kind of

00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,440
people that you'd speak to any way but

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:43,400
kind of studying it in a more wide sense

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,950
I found useful I think I had one of the

00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,290
risks of becoming quite largest that the

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,820
management team can become isolated from

00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:54,290
the production team the people who are

00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:56,720
actually making these things temptation

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:59,810
to hire people just to satisfy demand

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,970
you hiring the wrong people and that can

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,360
be a big risk it can you get one bad

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:07,940
apple can spoil things and he also has

00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,570
an increased need for better process and

00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,590
good documentation so that is scalable

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,140
sort of people know exactly what they're

00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:19,630
doing and also resource planning is

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:22,040
quite a big issue with us so we have a

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,750
manager he spent his whole time horizon

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,000
gazing and speaking with sales and

00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,190
production because the more projects you

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,250
have the more light and the bigger

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:35,240
clients and the more I there are shifts

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,980
in the decline requirement projects may

00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,980
go away for a period of time leaving a

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,500
big gap in your yeah I did guys with

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,360
tough in the bench and you have to run a

00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:49,970
profitable business avoid that at all

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:52,190
costs so Paul already mentioned so we'll

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,260
start with you this time that they are

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,120
about the risks that do you you

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,800
mentioned that you had some some some

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,680
bad bad things happening you a couple of

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:06,440
years ago hmm so have any risk realized

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:09,320
and how did you mitigate them and I mean

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,270
that that situation and it's kind of

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,060
concurrent with when I arrived I was

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:18,830
brought in to try and help too I shared

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:23,800
the division of the company and I

00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,800
suppose the CEO mitigated that boy

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:32,130
finding ways for that into those

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:35,160
individuals to depart but a lot of the

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:39,270
risk that we have is is around around

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,730
resource and we have a lot of staff it's

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,340
a hungry monster to feed so we have to

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:46,500
ensure that the sales pipeline is well

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,950
well filled we're looking into yeah the

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,940
middle of next year to ensure it's all

00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:55,860
about planning so I think having

00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,510
somebody who is not only the managing

00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,560
director of the company thinking about

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,960
finances and an aspect there's also the

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,210
the long-term resource planning that

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,710
really has been fundamental to us

00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:12,420
turning the company around okay and all

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,460
the others can also share war stories

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,770
now about the things that went wrong at

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,790
self what if something went wrong where

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:22,680
do you start certainly we've seen risk

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,150
you know I think risk and kind of come

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,770
in many forms some of the risk christine

00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,240
has been from clump some of our biggest

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,250
successes I guess when we've had really

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,350
rapid growth periods and you are trying

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,880
to kind of manage that growth and it

00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,190
feels good in your succeeding but also

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,480
you're growing kind of possibly quicker

00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,280
than that kind of scaffolding is going

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,750
up and you have to we've had definitely

00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,460
had some kind of retrenching periods

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,600
where we've just tried to to kind of

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,310
take a little bit of a step back and

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,930
make sure that where we've kind of

00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,910
achieved on that growth curve that's

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,950
sustainable and we've been lucky to kind

00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,920
of had have permanent growth I guess so

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,590
we've certainly kind of grown slower and

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,150
smaller than other people but we've been

00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,160
lucky to be able to kind of maintain it

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,010
and sustain it rather than I'm kind of

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,360
dipping up and down so I think that's

00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,700
kind of one of the keys i think is also

00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,390
just when which sounds a bit kind of a

00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,890
or negative but when thing you know when

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,630
it's things are going really really well

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,860
just understand what does that mean for

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,090
the next thing if you just hired ten

00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,130
people don't forget to look at that

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,390
pipeline that's three months out and six

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,890
months out because all of that growth

00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,540
needs to be kind of sustained otherwise

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,980
you just deal with really really

00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,810
irritating problems about kind of

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,310
dipping up and down and having to bring

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,930
people in and take people out and that

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,430
just takes a lot of energy and time

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,030
which would be better spent on kind of

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:36,360
investing in the future I think we have

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,609
a culture of celebrating failure other

00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,289
companies have

00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:42,619
employees of the month we have the fail

00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:45,859
of the month so this may sound strange

00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:48,430
but we really do do focus on like if you

00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:51,140
fail on something and stuff goes wrong

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,849
try to learn from it try to make it

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,940
public because failures are not

00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:58,460
expensive hidden failures are expensive

00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:01,339
and this leads to into sort of

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,499
retrospective also and the fun part

00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:05,329
being like all of the most expensive

00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:09,160
failures tend to be my failures all the

00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:12,619
way so I get really expensive stuff and

00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,779
there's so many risks and and you can't

00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:16,999
avoid all of them you just have to try

00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:19,460
to fail fast and fail cheap basically

00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:21,289
with those risks most of the risks are

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,269
of course around people because then

00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,880
their businesses around people so you

00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:27,440
may have co-founders who want to leave

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,119
the company at some point because they

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,730
don't feel like it's a company that able

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,680
to build anymore you have to try to be

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,239
civilized on how to deal with that then

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,890
of course you know if people want to

00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:41,029
leave they have to be able to leave on

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,589
good terms and and yeah so many stories

00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:46,549
around that when you do integration of

00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:48,589
companies and and we have like 17 native

00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:55,519
languages spoken in a group so cultural

00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:57,470
diversity is there so yeah people so a

00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,109
bunch of wonder crowd people celebrating

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,970
at the bar last night I don't know if

00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:10,700
they I don't know what they failed on

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:13,430
but something something went wrong so um

00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,779
so I think there's two types of risks

00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,569
that as the leader of the organization

00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:19,609
you have to look out for there's you

00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:21,650
know like economics there's micro risks

00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:23,450
there are things you can control inside

00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,940
of your own environment and that's what

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,039
most of us probably have to spend most

00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,009
of our time on and then there's the

00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,960
macro the environmental risks that we

00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,460
sort of can maybe influence or we can

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,819
kind of steer around but it's like the

00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,470
weather you can't you can't control it

00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:42,079
you know if Drupal disappeared off the

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,029
face of the planet tomorrow you know

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,230
what would they do to our business is we

00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:47,239
you know we don't like to define

00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,599
ourselves as triple companies but we're

00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:51,440
dependent on it right and so things like

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:53,720
that are also

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,339
Gary so the things that it's it's

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,150
disproportionate I think the things that

00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:01,250
a CEO probably stays awake at night

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,099
thinking about are the things they can't

00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:05,780
control disproportionately and then the

00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,970
things that you can control you don't

00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,880
always do a good job with so you know

00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,980
when it comes to the specific things um

00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,440
you know I think our biggest failures

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:19,400
were our biggest failure came you know

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,079
two to three years ago when we was not

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,130
really because of growth it was because

00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,130
of not understanding how quickly our

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,890
organization moved then how much we had

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,540
to have a pulse on the numbers and we

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,339
didn't really have a good sense of our

00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:38,329
own numbers were much more data-driven

00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:40,819
now than we were a couple years ago and

00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:43,790
you have to be if the if you know if ten

00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:47,030
percent growth is actually you know 15

00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:48,920
people then you know every hiring

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,920
decision you make there has to be driven

00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,660
by some further future planning you know

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,829
it's really it's really important that

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,720
you understand the pipeline you

00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:58,790
understand the metrics the profitability

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,310
your gross margin you have to know your

00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:03,079
expenses are if you know your cash and

00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:06,230
how much cash you have and how long you

00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,760
can go and so those types of in their

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,280
operational metrics your utilization

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,010
your effective rate your you know cost

00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:17,119
per employee all of those things the

00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:19,069
KPIs that ki ki know the key process

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,099
indicators that you want within your

00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:24,230
organization are probably for us the

00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,270
most important maturity point in the

00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,220
last year or two just really knowing

00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,550
those gives us confidence to grow

00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,230
because we can hopefully see any kind of

00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:36,140
issues coming a little bit further out

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,599
in the future excellent and then there's

00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,119
a one question from the audience that I

00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,400
brutally will will manual a bit so there

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,530
the question is the original question is

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,900
a large customers better for growth

00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,660
that's more customers but my question

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,609
rated at that how has your clients

00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,230
changed when you have grown quick

00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:58,260
answers and then we'll go to the last

00:45:54,230 --> 00:46:01,110
week sorry anyone

00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,000
so yeah as we've gotten bigger our

00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,460
clients have gotten bigger and that's

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,370
that has been a both reality that I

00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,750
think everybody will reflect and also

00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:12,030
one of the reasons we got bigger was to

00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,260
serve those larger clients so it's it's

00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:17,340
by design as well as by effect I don't

00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,130
really have anything that that's the

00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,740
case we've definitely found larger

00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,270
clients to be beneficial because you can

00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,520
sell multiple projects to them in that

00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,570
relationship is more valuable and you

00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,280
think you have to recognize that the

00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,810
cost of sale goes up to larger clients

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,240
that initial kind of foot in the door

00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,560
stuff can take a lot longer and be a lot

00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,220
more time consuming than it came for

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,880
smaller clients and our clients have

00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,440
gone from having small enterprises that

00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,460
have strong owners and you just got to

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,350
convince that one person to CEOs maybe

00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,450
boards that you have to go through a

00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:53,280
very bigger process and convince a lot

00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,840
more people and be more authoritative in

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,940
how you're doing it so it can be a

00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,110
longer process you have to be very

00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,820
self-assured ok and now listen carefully

00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:06,180
because now it's time for the key

00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,100
takeaway from the panel so one sentence

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:18,360
advised to the people that are thinking

00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:22,080
of growing please uh I would say the

00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:26,610
most important thing is is is well it's

00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:29,040
cliche world peace the most important

00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:32,880
thing is is the people you hire just

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,990
make sure you don't lose track of what

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,270
vesser Tim or somebody said just each

00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:42,330
person you add into that organization

00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,190
while they may be small relative to the

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,040
size you're growing too they have the

00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:50,490
ability to either make you successful or

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:55,650
start to hurt you and so each person you

00:47:50,490 --> 00:48:01,860
bring in is critical to the success I'll

00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:06,270
try to stick in one sentence okay don't

00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:08,250
forget why you do it that was half my

00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,350
money I think be really clear what you

00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,970
want to achieve and why because if you

00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,320
don't get those two things together

00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:17,160
I think it can get quite complicated

00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:20,359
quickly and have a long-term objective

00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,359
and take small steps to get there

00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,859
excellent so now all of the audience are

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,470
experts in growth so the now it's time

00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:32,580
to go deeper so any questions so you can

00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:34,800
use the hashtag Drupal fast lane and we

00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,890
won't answer them right now but we won't

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,830
kindly ask you to come to the microphone

00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:43,020
but the these guys have a promise that

00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,340
they will they will get back to you in

00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,580
Twitter for those questions that I

00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,710
didn't ask now but we have now 12

00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:54,320
minutes and Counting for any questions

00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,320
that you might have please go to the mic

00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:02,220
you guys on the line there if you like

00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:03,660
what if should shut the founder of a

00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,240
company presume the founder of your of

00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,510
your company is a developer I'm myself

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,609
here what this developers say is very

00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:14,070
very good should that person become the

00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:17,400
company leader like yourselves or higher

00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:20,460
in a company leader let's say and remain

00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,849
as the top developer in the company what

00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,680
do you want to do it depends on that

00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:27,660
really what do you want to do if you

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,790
want to become a leader the common

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,470
leader go and get trained up in business

00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,660
stuff it's really not all that that

00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:36,750
fancy just go into an MBA or whatever

00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,070
that simple developers will be X and O

00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,410
technical people in general will be

00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,270
excellent leaders if they just get the

00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,710
experience and training but if you would

00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:48,950
what you want to really do is hack

00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,950
triple ya know then you need to do that

00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:59,410
for the podium recording that the

00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,640
question was that the weather day is the

00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:04,240
problem that the founder of the company

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:10,450
is below the management in the bigger

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:12,460
company so so I think as you grow so i

00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:15,160
actually have i have four original

00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,840
founders in addition for riginal

00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,010
founders then through our position

00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,020
another founder then we have an employee

00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,119
stock plan and then we've been giving

00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,070
some stock to various management and so

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,560
we're starting to get to a point where

00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,990
we're more like a corporation and less

00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,850
like a firm that's controlled by a few

00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,700
owners and we're encouraging that by

00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:39,790
drawing distinctions between those that

00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,040
own equity in the company and those that

00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,980
are officers acting on behalf of the

00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,359
company and we think this is helping us

00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,790
professionalize so we've brought in

00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:52,869
people from the outside like a my coo

00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:54,910
for instance who who'd was not an equity

00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:57,850
owner in the company but is a very

00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:00,280
experienced business executive and we've

00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,140
taken a founder in this case one of my

00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,859
partner's originally and we have

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,780
essentially put him underneath him based

00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,270
on skill and we think that we'll every

00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,760
time we do that we're doing that for the

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,740
employees we're telling the company we

00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,109
will run this company as efficiently and

00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,180
effectively as we can regardless of our

00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:20,410
ownership interests and that's also in

00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,090
the interests of those people that own

00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,570
it because they get to watch

00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:27,640
professionals build build value for them

00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,230
that they would otherwise be trying to

00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,850
do themselves so we're actually

00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,130
embracing the distinction between

00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:37,420
ownership and management in a very

00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:40,060
strong way if I forgot one more thing

00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,420
don't ever be worried done hiring most

00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:45,700
senior and smarter people than you are

00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,500
because most founders are actually

00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,910
afraid of that it's like what if I bring

00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,650
this person on board and they are

00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:52,180
smarter than me and more experienced and

00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:55,230
they're gonna take over and your

00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,230
business groups yeah

00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,890
excellent next question high percentage

00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:07,400
wise what was your split between

00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:10,750
developers sales personnel and project

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:16,700
managers when you were small and

00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:18,890
compared to now that you're big I think

00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,060
we found we would develop a heavy at the

00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,650
start because you don't have much

00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,940
process or infrastructure around that

00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,740
and then I think we're at the ratio of

00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,619
about a third developers and then the

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,480
rest our support staff creative project

00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:31,550
managers finance things like that so I

00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,050
think it the ratio does change and it's

00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,060
really important to understand your

00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,950
who's billable and who's not because as

00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,230
you get bigger there's be less than your

00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:41,349
ratios of who's actually charges rates

00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:44,020
will go down which kind of shifts your

00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:47,000
numbers on your head count quite quickly

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:49,220
I think it's natural to have a shift in

00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,990
the proportion often times in a small

00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,920
company people wear several different

00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,880
hats and so I mean currently we've

00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,890
probably got about sixty percent

00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:05,000
developers we've got 50 odd staff we've

00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:07,160
got for project managers and to dedicate

00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,109
salespeople and so we were very very

00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:16,070
heavy on the dev still but we've we've

00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:20,390
got these you repeat those numbers so

00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:23,150
we've got 50 staff we've got about fifty

00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:25,700
percent developers we've got three or

00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,300
four protein managers and then we've got

00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,010
a management team about five people a

00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,220
very small design team and then

00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,750
administrative staff want to put up I

00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:38,599
mean the developers are the fuel for

00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:44,390
business there you guys are their money

00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:46,310
so I think think our stats or something

00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:51,050
and don't quote me on the exacts but so

00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:53,330
130 people about 60 of them or just

00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,240
straight developers than we have are

00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,670
like you x business analyst requirements

00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,880
people project managers and all that

00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:03,950
sorry that's that's like 70 developers

00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,690
and then it's like 30 in those other

00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,700
categories so when you add all that up

00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:11,900
side of the 131

00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:14,750
them or delivery staff so billable you

00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,420
know in some capacity 10 in sales and

00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,730
then 20 and the rest of the business

00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:23,660
function so like 15 between sales and

00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:25,780
marketing something like that so yeah I

00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,369
think the biggest change we've seen is

00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:31,099
we have more diverse now so we are

00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:33,500
hiring more experts on say you axe or

00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:34,760
something like that we we haven't well

00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,339
structure should be different we don't

00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,349
have sales at all so that's that's why

00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:41,570
the shift hasn't been so dramatic for us

00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,829
if I look at the numbers and I don't

00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,980
have the numbers right now I can't

00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:47,480
remember him but it's it's also been you

00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,800
know more like specialists on stuff

00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,040
that's been definitely the biggest

00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,020
change we've seen over two years change

00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,780
us out did you say that you don't have

00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:58,910
any sales personnel like yourself well

00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,760
we call our sales consultants and they

00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:03,170
available so that's the you can call

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,400
them key account managers they do the

00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:10,070
same job but the difference is we

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:12,680
actually build their hours hi what's

00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:15,200
your vision in sustaining growth with

00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:22,880
multiple leadership's and does it have a

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:24,349
positive or negative effect what do you

00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,030
mean by multiple leadership's you mean

00:55:24,349 --> 00:55:28,310
if you have multiple people in the

00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:33,380
company having strong ideas or visions

00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:36,200
about the future well I have some

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,810
experience on bad and good examples of

00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:42,200
this in a good healthy relationship you

00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:45,920
are aligned and and you know you

00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:48,530
complete some of your your you know

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,810
weaknesses and so on in a bad

00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,700
relationship you you end up disagreeing

00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:55,069
on everything and you can't get anywhere

00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,839
because of that and if you end up in the

00:55:55,069 --> 00:55:59,119
later situation you you know somebody

00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:04,700
has to leave if it's the first one great

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:09,650
so depends on the people quite a bit yes

00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:11,839
so you can you about the ownership

00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:15,109
versus kind of officer thing is

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,690
important here because you have to rain

00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:18,819
anybody in who's in

00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,550
owner who feels that they should be in

00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:24,760
any way driving things differently than

00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:26,530
your chief executive right so and even

00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:30,069
if you're a five-person company you

00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:33,550
should have a CEO and that CEO should be

00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:35,589
in charge and the rest of the team is

00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,260
there to do certain parts of the

00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:40,300
business the CEO is not supposed to run

00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,359
all aspects of the business there's a

00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,859
delegation and there's a dividing up of

00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,869
roles and responsibilities that's

00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:49,270
critical to getting growth because if

00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:50,800
you've got even see this a lot in this

00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:54,190
community in the Drupal community you'll

00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,810
see that to the two owner shop right the

00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:58,300
through owner shop goes to about 15

00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,430
people maybe 20 right and what happens

00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,770
is you got you know one tech Taiwan

00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:05,500
business card to tech guys with you know

00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:07,630
split up roles and if they are pulling

00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,540
in different directions equally then

00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:12,430
it's impossible to move forward they

00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,349
have to either be a hundred percent on

00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,060
the same page or they have to divide and

00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:18,520
conquer on what those roles are and one

00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,170
of them is deciding strategy and one of

00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,670
them is focused on the operational

00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,530
aspects or something like that that

00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,200
works as you get a little bit bigger

00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,640
you're going to want more of a CEO and

00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,050
then someone someone who handles

00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,700
marketing so I'm going to handle sales

00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:33,550
someone's going to handle the operations

00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,500
and those people need to have clear what

00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:37,180
we call swim lanes you know it's like

00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,319
you know exactly what who's swimming in

00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,740
what Lane so they're not bumping into

00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:43,839
each other and the best tool I can use I

00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,450
could recommend for that is a racy chart

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,880
if you're familiar with racy it's it's

00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:51,369
an acronym you can google it but um it

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,740
trend it's a great exercise to get

00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:54,700
people to focus on what value want

00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,500
purpose they're doing for the

00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,050
organization and make sure that those

00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,210
all align with the vision and the

00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:02,170
strategy and they're not pulling away in

00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:08,109
different directions so they're

00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:10,599
complementary next question being close

00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:13,150
to the microphone hi there so you talked

00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:16,660
specifically about how important culture

00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:18,609
is and I'm curious as you've grown you

00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,030
know what you've done to be intentional

00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:24,280
about preserving culture if that's been

00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:25,930
sort of top-down leadership you know or

00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,300
if that comes from within your

00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,100
organization or how you've how you've

00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,320
made that work and in

00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:37,030
given how important that it is you know

00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:39,800
what steps is as CEOs you've taken to

00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,980
sustain that as you as you grown and be

00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,080
intentional about it we could do a

00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,730
really long answer to this one but a

00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,530
very short version because we I think

00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,460
we're a bit short on time would be just

00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:53,960
set an example and be consistent on that

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,100
I think it's important to remember to

00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,020
use you're going to have a culture

00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:00,410
regardless of whether you're mindful of

00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:02,360
it and kind of understanding what you're

00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:04,100
trying to kind of cultivate and and how

00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:07,610
and having kind of a finger on the pulse

00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:09,320
as you go is really important and I

00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:13,130
think it's important to know what your

00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:15,050
culture is and to admit that externally

00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:18,490
so that you can attract people who are

00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:23,020
like-minded to so that you can grow that

00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:26,120
excellent and then the last question hi

00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,980
I have a question regarding growth we've

00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,720
been talking about that we need to like

00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,970
have good employees and find good

00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,950
employees if you what would be your

00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:38,720
advice when you have a company of the

00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:40,370
size 15 to 25 before we can hire as

00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,340
somebody to take care of finding

00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:45,440
employees somebody has to find an

00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:47,570
employee and then often the CEO of the

00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,300
company or who is in that tough position

00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,940
in the company how much time would you

00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,250
say that you have to spend on finding

00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:58,010
good employees so your company can have

00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,900
a good growth and I think it's the most

00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:03,800
important thing you can do because a bad

00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:05,840
hire will cost you time goodwill it's

01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,480
really kind of toxic so I've always kept

01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,800
quite close to that process in terms of

01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,050
the kind of the final parts of it to

01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,490
make sure that we don't have people that

01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,480
you know it's not going to work out for

01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,130
either party they're going to be unhappy

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,420
and want to leave and they're not going

01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:19,400
to be kind of good for the business so

01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,380
it's something I think you want to kind

01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,000
of makers efficient as you can but I'll

01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,220
never lose sight of how critical it is

01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,100
in a service business because it's it

01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:32,480
sets the tone for everything and the way

01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:34,250
we do hiring is we worst have the local

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,410
a managing director for gantry being as

01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,480
a filter so they spend a fair amount of

01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:40,880
death their dime line filtering the

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,320
candidates after after an assistant has

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,650
such dropped really bad applicants

01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,630
to be honest and the last step actually

01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,010
is a team interview so the team who

01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:52,200
actually will end up working with the

01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,690
person makes the final decision so to

01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,700
say it's not the manager or the CEO

01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,990
anyone elses the team and that helps

01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,760
quite a bit because it's a nice and

01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:01,890
honest discussion between like what the

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,360
company is like and making sure that

01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,430
because the theme has to survive with

01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,870
that person as well so that's sort of

01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,250
it's going to make your life a bit

01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,310
easier if you're running a company as

01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:13,560
well well as a company we spent quite a

01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,790
bit of time doing it because if we don't

01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,080
do it right then we're going to spend

01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:20,310
even more time because it's going to

01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,810
have to be done again so yes I think the

01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,460
point the size point that you mentioned

01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:26,040
is that particularly difficult and I do

01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:29,070
remember being at that point we we did

01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,590
it somewhere around 40 get our own

01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:35,370
dedicated person focused on recruiting

01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:37,830
in that made a huge difference we did

01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:39,090
dabble with staffing agencies and things

01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:41,820
I mean we worked with them for a while

01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:45,060
but it's a difficult in here and all the

01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,950
reasons why it's hard but um I think

01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,080
that one of the most effective things

01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:52,860
you can do my best advice for you would

01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:56,070
be get your core team together have them

01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:58,620
brainstorm good strong people that

01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:00,150
they've worked with before and have a

01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,890
really strong understanding what you

01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,830
need and see if there are any matches

01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:07,080
and if you get even one really great

01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:10,050
person that someone worked with before

01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:11,640
who just comes in and adds a ton to your

01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,980
your culture and your ideas and your

01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,510
growth that will spiral out and so it's

01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,760
a network effective really it's it's

01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,860
basically a network effect of good

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,410
people and so I think if you can

01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:24,150
brainstorm people that you can bring

01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,890
into the organization that are referrals

01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:28,680
people that some all of you have worked

01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:33,150
with you trust that will get you really

01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:35,420
for excellent Thank You panelist Thank

01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,420
You audience

01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:49,410
don't you leave yet back to topics so

01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,730
first and foremost give feedback this is

01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,590
important this is the only way that we

01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,300
can improve and the other one they even

01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:59,370
more important thing that the discussion

01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:02,490
