Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: dasrecht
Drush is not only awesome for managing your local Drupal site, with site aliases you can manage Drupal sites on remote servers without logging in via SSH!

With Drush Deploy you even can deploy sites on multiple servers completely automated with one tool we all aready know at heart: Drush, no other additional library like Capistrano needed!

In this Session we will present how to setup Drush to work with remote sites, what is possible and what we use in our daily business.

Then we will dig deeper into Drush Deploy: how it works, what it does and show how to set it up to deploy a drupal site on multiple servers with a single command, with automated backups, database updates, cache clears and even rollback functionalities.

We will cover all the different parts which need to be aligned before we can start using drush to deploy your site. We will also cover the problems we had and how we solved it and give you a outlook to Drupal 8 to show you that establishing a good deployment does not mean it will break with the next Drupal release.
