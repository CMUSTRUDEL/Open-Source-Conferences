Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: CKEditor in Drupal 8 - The New Possibilities
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: wwalc
Drupal 8 will finally be shipped with a default WYSIWYG editor: CKEditor. Content creation and editing is one of the most frequent tasks in CMS applications, that’s why it’s important to fully grasp the tools used while editing. A good understanding of the editor will help you control what’s being posted and increase the efficiency of your site’s content creators.

This session will not only guide you through CKEditor-related features in Drupal 8, but will also help you extend CKEditor functionality by providing your own features.

Agenda:

Why existing WYSIWYG solutions for Drupal 6/7 are bad.
New features offered in CKEditor & Text Editor modules.
What is ACF? How content filtering works in CKEditor.
Widgets: why use them and how they handle images.
Writing and adding plugins to CKEditor, extending the list of configuration options.
Security: HTML Filter vs. ACF.
Migration.
About me: Wiktor Walc, CTO @ CKSource. I’m a Drupal enthusiast. I had the pleasure of being an FCKeditor / CKEditor module maintainer for Drupal 5, 6 & 7.

alright so thank you everyone for coming

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,830
here I would talk today about sicky tour

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,540
in Drupal aight my name is victor vaults

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,400
and just a few words about myself I've

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,289
been maintaining the city to module for

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,350
a couple of years already for Drupal 6

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,900
and drupal 7 and I work as a CTO for

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,980
sicky source company that created ski

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,010
editor and I'll talk today about the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,140
status of wizard editing in Drupal 7 I

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,559
will tell you about the new features

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,570
that Drupal 8 offers I will tell you a

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,480
bit about some cool features inside

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,670
sukitte or itself one of them is a CF

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,460
advanced content filter and the other

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,730
one is switches which is recreated

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,239
actually thanks to Drupal 8 requirements

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,340
and we had to introduce images with

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,559
captions for Drupal 8 and we ended up

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,020
with a very powerful feature called

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,020
widgets and I will tell you how to

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,290
extend the functionality of sikhi editor

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,390
in Drupal 8 by adding your own plugins

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,720
or 3rd party plugins that you found

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,909
somewhere I will tell you a little bit

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,090
about other things like security or

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,759
migration all right so let's start with

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,280
Drupal 7 this is the default with week a

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:26,220
determined rupal 7 and yeah it's very

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,720
simple and and good and fast it's

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,549
clearly it has no bags yeah so when I

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,040
saw it for the first time many many

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,040
years back my reaction was like this

00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:43,079
yeah but thankfully after you play with

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,720
Drupal for a while you see that there

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,479
are concrete modules which you can

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,180
instruct you add some functionality on

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,070
top of the core Drupal and you have

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,590
actually two very good options in Drupal

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,780
7 one of them is the wizard modules with

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,049
Rick module and the other one is sukira

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,219
module both of them have their strong

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,349
sides and some websites and together

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,180
they are quite popular there are almost

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,800
600,000 sides running drupal 7 together

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,560
with one of them

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,060
and this is awesome but there is a

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,920
problem with this you have to spend time

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,050
on things like research you have to

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,590
choose which module to use have to

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,750
almost you have two modules with which

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,050
has the same popularity you have to

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,580
choose which editor to use actually and

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,470
then if you decide for example you see

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,290
key editor you have to you pick up which

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,800
distribution of the editor you want to

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,970
use so it's no spend some time on it

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,370
then you have to install the thing that

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,320
we decided to install a test it

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,640
configure it and things like that and

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,990
then you have to maintain this thing

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,420
which again takes time and even if you

00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,670
install a secret or module for example

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,680
you will still face some problems for

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,690
example you contribute ckeditor you

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,340
configure it to use the image button but

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,650
after is save some content with images

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,810
you see that images are lost because you

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,030
configure a security door in one place

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,560
and you configured text formats in

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,650
another place so there is a

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,170
configuration mismatch many times and up

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,489
till recently you had also this

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,920
confusion when you install the ckeditor

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,350
module because you install sticky editor

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:35,100
module but seiki editor wasn't there so

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:37,500
what da ya so drupal 8 secure is in car

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,430
so we don't have to search test install

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,590
and let's say that animal it took two

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,780
hours to do some research installation

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,670
and things like that it means that as a

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,480
community we saved almost 1 million

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:57,090
hours in Drupal 8 yay and we can spend

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,160
it on Arnold writing new modules for

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,140
Drupal or things like that or you can

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,560
simply party alright so what we have in

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,560
Drupal 8 we can select any text editor

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,840
actually and text formats and editors

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,239
administration page you don't have to

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,340
use ckeditor we can use any other

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,190
editors that will be available for

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,280
Drupal 8 you have some really cool

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,600
dragon job toolbar configurator it's

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,370
really awesome it's you know

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,920
the accessibility is perfect of this

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,790
tool and things like that and what's

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,650
really cool that is that the HTML filter

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,020
settings are automatically updated when

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:42,310
you change the key to configuration and

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,830
there is also really nice API that lets

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,590
you register additional city to plugins

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,120
so if you want to extend the features of

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,770
sikhi touring car you can do it very

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,650
easy yeah so I have upwards a couple of

00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:02,170
videos that show how steel works in

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:07,320
Drupal 8 this video shows how we can

00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,320
configure a text formats in Drupal 8

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,880
here we add the table button to the

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:18,160
toolbar and see that the list of allowed

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,380
HTML tags has been extended

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,300
automatically with all the tags that are

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,920
required by the table button so any you

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,020
have you see that there are a couple of

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,030
tags that you have you'll have to place

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,710
manually in the list of valid HTML tags

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:38,560
and it's sometimes hard here we add the

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,540
underline button to the toolbar see that

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,960
the new element has been added

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:49,300
automatically as well and it works also

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,080
in the opposite side so if you remove

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,410
the underline button the element will be

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,510
removed here as well you will see that

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,500
this that this is not happening always I

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,170
will show you another video where this

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,840
administration forum will work in a

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,240
little different way who is have some

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
interesting thing we add the stylist

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,710
combo which actually comes with a

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,620
configuration options that you can set

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,510
so the configuration options are shown

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,270
only when a feature is enabled in

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,940
ckeditor and what is really cool you can

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,950
create your own modules that provide

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:34,060
your own plugins that extend this

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:35,890
configuration form as well and this we

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,350
added just the Styles button to the

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:42,200
toolbar which lets you style content

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,960
it with classes or elements with classes

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,350
and what is really cool here that is

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,780
that we just talk Suki editor to use

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,320
hitters to style the content with some

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,300
classes and those hears from the

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,120
configuration settings were added to the

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,590
list of a lot HTML tags as well and why

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,360
is this happening or how it is happening

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,610
this is possible thanks to a hidden

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,040
cikita instance running there behind a

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,530
drupal contacts city editor asking it

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,640
for the list of HTML elements that it

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,900
needs so you know there is a perfect

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,960
connection between the administration

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:27,050
area and ckeditor sorry yeah actually

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,900
this is the end of this video so let's

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:38,870
move on to another slide all right so

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:43,550
let's see the next video here we'll

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:48,410
configure the basic tool bar and we'll

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:52,840
add the strike element actually as

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,840
element to create strike content

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:09,409
now we create some sample article with

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:19,250
some strike text sorry I don't type fast

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:23,099
even for the video alright so then work

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,439
yeah now let's try to do something nasty

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:29,939
and let's change the text format

00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:34,039
configuration and let's remove this

00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,039
tried button and see what will happen oh

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:43,320
it's true the S element is still there

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,180
what did it happen this is because this

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,100
is by design this is because you already

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,930
saved this text format so there is a

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,089
possibility that you created already

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:57,990
some content with the S element and if

00:08:53,089 --> 00:09:00,570
now the configuration the scripts here

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,640
that you know automate this stuff will

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,410
remove the stack automatically you could

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
possibly end up with some broken

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,790
contents so if you already save the text

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
format and you remove some buttons if

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:16,079
you want to disable some tax you have to

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:19,230
do it manually and now let's see how

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:26,220
this will affect the article that we

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:30,000
will edit again so see that the strike

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:34,529
button isn't there but you see still the

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,140
strike strike text in the editor and of

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:41,029
course the animal is still there

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,029
although the button is is not available

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,380
yeah so the content is still left there

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:55,210
all right so let's move on to another

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:58,090
slide I will tell you now about the

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:02,020
advanced content filter advanced content

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:11,260
filter is a feature that lets you remove

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:14,380
unwanted content in the editor yeah so

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,410
you can disallow certain tags and those

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,450
tags will be not allowed already in the

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,050
editor so if you desire all tables in

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,390
the text format configuration sicky

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,040
editor will actually already remove them

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,100
to provide some better wysiwyg

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,560
experience of course the filters in

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Drupal will still remove any tags that

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:42,160
cikita will live or honor if you remove

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:44,620
seiki a deterrent you know use plain

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,440
text area or if you armel outer the post

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,680
request still the filters are there in

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,400
Drupal but you know sicky editor and by

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,220
doing the same filtering straight into

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,870
editing area I provide some better with

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,100
week experience because there is no

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,780
mismatch between the things that you

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,150
have in the editor and the thing that

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:08,020
you see after saving the note in in

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:10,780
Drupal and the ACF is quite smart if you

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,950
for example these are all the be element

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,050
but a lot of strong elements cikita will

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,680
transform this be into strong because

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:25,950
they have more less the same meaning so

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:29,560
yeah the ACF is quite smart and because

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,510
ACF actually can strip some tags

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,180
whenever you switch text format you may

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,960
see such a popup message of course you

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,560
will not lose any content unless you

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,720
save an article but just bear in mind

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:50,770
that you know ICF may remove some things

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,190
yeah so one more video this time about

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,010
ACF

00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:01,620
so we'll add CT editor to restricted

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:07,930
formats just to have more configurations

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:11,050
to be shown and now let's create some

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:15,760
content and try to see a CF in action

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:19,470
let's use the restricted HTML clicks

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:24,130
format and paste some nasty HTML content

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,720
sorry I was too late yeah so we are

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,329
pasting in the source mode of city

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,959
editor a script tag and some footer

00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:35,829
element both of them are disallowed in a

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:38,709
restricted HTML text format but it means

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:42,190
that also a sickie editor will make an

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:44,380
attempt to remove them so let's see an

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,529
ACF will run whenever you switch from

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,320
source mode to WYSIWYG mode or ACF will

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,930
run whenever you paste content so it

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,089
runs in in different situations so yeah

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,880
we have script and footer we just switch

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,910
to visual element it's full húsavík mode

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,260
and we see that the script element has

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,180
been removed completely because it

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,940
doesn't make sense to keep the content

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,730
of the script element when we remove the

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,949
script element but the content of footer

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,440
element has still some meaning and it's

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:19,360
just a pure text so we will have the

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,990
content of the footer element and

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,970
replaced it with you know some other

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:29,110
element that makes sense and it's all

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:31,410
out in sticky little alright so let's

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,410
move on

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,060
now let's give you some more complex

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,630
data structure this is actually some wch

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,180
checklist and we have here Heather's at

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:50,670
the top and the table with some lists

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:54,750
inside let's see what will happen if you

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:57,529
pass it to this editor which doesn't

00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,269
support tables doesn't support hitters

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,899
we see that actually secretly removed

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:07,769
almost all actually removes these

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:10,920
elements I mean tables and here's but

00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:13,470
the text has been left and same with

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,339
lace so we ended up with some clean

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:21,690
structure here which still has the same

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,060
meaning now let's switch to the basic

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:28,290
format here the situation is a bit

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,839
different we allowed tables and by

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:35,250
configuring the Stiles combo to accept a

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:39,600
hitter to you and either three we allow

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,760
also hitters so let's paste content here

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,279
and see that hitters are left at the top

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,279
and and thus always read the table

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:58,790
and a CF is enabled when HTML filter is

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,319
enabled in text format so when we switch

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:06,019
to a text format where HTML filter is

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:09,230
not enabled ACF is not enabled by

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:13,699
default and we'll see what problems it

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:17,240
rings and this is chrome we just paste

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,459
content from external website where the

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,100
external website was using classes to

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:24,350
style the content to make red heater and

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,110
things like that at from things that it

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,959
will be cool to you know actually copy

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:33,250
all those styles to your website so it

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:39,259
transforms them to in I stars a and

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:41,959
creates a huge mess in in your content

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:43,819
you see it was actually a hitter with

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,250
some class but when you copy it in

00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:48,800
chrome you end up with something like

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,810
this and it's happening in chrome it

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:58,040
doesn't happen in Firefox for example

00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:02,300
and ACF can remove this think all right

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,529
so here we have Firefox will do the same

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:09,290
thing with in Firefox yeah we'll use the

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:14,380
full HTML text format to use editor

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,380
without a CF will copy the same table

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:21,560
and turn i'm actually sick it or do the

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,290
same job here and you see that the

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,750
results in chrome and firefox are really

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,870
different so if you like to have the

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,420
same result in google chrome as well you

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,279
should have a CF enabled i will show the

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,279
other later how you can do it in fact

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:44,120
yeah so the content in firefox is much

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,740
cleaner and this is just pure

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,600
information that you actually want it to

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,600
copy from from the external website

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,639
alright so let's switch to another topic

00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:58,339
let's see what editing possibilities we

00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,199
have in Drupal 8 actually a Drupal 8

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,600
comes with classic editor which you

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,280
might already know because this is the

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,920
default solution that is

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,290
running in Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 if you

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,940
install ckeditor module Andrew polite

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:16,040
comes with a vertical align editor and

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,960
yeah so the classic editor is used in

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,370
the administration back end so it's

00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,980
quite similar to do you think that you

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,650
should be already familiar with is using

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,080
iframes which means that the backend

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,590
team has no effect on the styling of the

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,440
editing area and the cool thing is that

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,290
in Drupal 8 from 10 teams my register

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,990
some style sheets do you make the

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,000
editable inside seiki editor a little

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,600
mod more a little bit more similar to

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,740
what your end users will see when you

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,350
create an article all right so this is a

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,620
classic editor in action you see that no

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:59,240
the phones are not exactly the same like

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:03,200
they will be on the article when you

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:07,130
save it and we have quick editing option

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,260
where no iframes are used so it means

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,950
that CSS styles from the surrounding

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,960
website will actually be inherited by

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,520
the editing area so everything that we

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,160
will edit inside the editor we look

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:24,860
exactly the same when you save it so

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:26,620
this is real wizard finally yeah just to

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,360
show you an example this is an article

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,610
and drupal 8 you have a quick edit

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,850
option in top right corner and you can

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,760
you click on it you have the editor

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:41,030
available and the styling of the article

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,310
is you know the same when you enable the

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,310
editor because this is the editing area

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,730
alright so a few words about how we can

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,610
start content in the editor in Drupal 8

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,740
the recommended way is to use siesta CSS

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,010
style definitions in your games you can

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,470
define some classes to you know allow

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,870
your users to style content in my

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,260
consistent way when you define these

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:12,290
classes you can you know you can define

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,960
which classes are actually enabled for

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,330
the end user by using edit settings form

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,560
that I shown earlier and

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,250
you know using classes is cool because

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,740
you have semantic markup and so you

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,240
separated from the visual you separate

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,520
the mic up from from the visual

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,050
presentation actually and this is handy

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,390
because you have consistent styling on

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,770
your website you work less because you

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,390
don't have to you know search for

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,850
previous article where you use some

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,870
styling and you to use it again it's

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:45,800
much better approach yeah but what if

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:48,800
your customers insist on using a color

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,340
buttons for example there is a solution

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,350
for that but first let me mention that

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,940
the sick eater and report car is not

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,030
actually the full preset which you

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,030
perhaps downloaded in the past this is

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,760
actually more standard like distribution

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:08,240
where some plugins like color buttons

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,940
are not available but by using a very

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:17,740
simple API you can add any plugins you

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:22,490
want to Drupal 8 and you know make it

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:25,220
call for your customers yeah so when you

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:30,650
create some module that provides plugins

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,510
you can enable it as usual and the

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,370
buttons will show up just like you know

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,330
the buttons provided by the core

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,800
distribution of ckeditor in Drupal and

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:48,140
prom your customers can create beautiful

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:51,560
websites again alright so let's switch

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,420
to another topic I widgets as i said

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,250
before our widgets were introduced the

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,740
tanks to drupal eyes and the requirement

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:01,430
of having to produce images with

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:05,870
captions we created a prototype in two

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:10,220
days and then now ended up working on

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:12,830
this feature for one year which is our

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,110
which content is that at act as a single

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,720
entity I will show you later what it

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:21,440
means in fact and it is really simple to

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,940
create provide your own widgets thanks

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,300
to the generic widget plugin which

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,580
provide this feature all right so to

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,059
show you what widgets are i will show

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,210
you first how we use

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:36,460
you do how we used to deal with HTML

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,059
structures in the past when we used

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,940
templates in CGI editor so basically

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,190
templates it was a plugin instigator

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,950
which allowed you to insert some HTML

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,899
snippets into the editor but the problem

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,940
is that when you insert it such HTML

00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:54,370
structure you had no control over it it

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,429
was easy to break it delete parts of it

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,009
you of course we had no possibility to

00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:01,570
drag and drop the structure later and of

00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,960
course the switcher is not available in

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:09,190
Drupal 8 by default I simply mention it

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,110
to show you the power of widgets yeah so

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,820
let's see a templates in action this is

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,999
a dialog window provided by the

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,639
templates plugin we select your image

00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,889
and title template and when you insert

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:22,899
something like this into ckeditor we can

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:25,840
end up with an image on the left side

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:29,740
title at the top and some text about the

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,289
image on the below the problems with

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:35,440
this is that actually there's no control

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:38,110
over what users can enter in the title

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,559
element they can insert a table or the

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,690
whole article there is no control over

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,269
the different pieces of the structure so

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,610
users could delete the image but leaving

00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:51,460
the contextual text information on the

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,649
right side so this is not cool when

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:58,509
working with some structures which

00:22:53,649 --> 00:23:03,549
should be immutable so as a solution of

00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:06,669
course widgets e so with which is you

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,559
can I work with those structures as a

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:11,470
whole which is select the whole widget

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,039
copied deleted you can drag and drop a

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:17,679
widget you can define which parts of

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,159
which it should be editable so we can

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:25,139
make the whole widgets uneditable for

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:29,289
example you can app cast and downcast

00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:31,749
widgets to simpler data format so we can

00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:35,169
represent complex structure in ckeditor

00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:37,659
but save it as something simple you

00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:41,259
possibly modify how it will look like in

00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:43,809
the future and we can provide common

00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,860
dialogues context money for widgets and

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,780
provide some causes

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,010
consistent look and feel for similar

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:54,970
structures yeah so which is our cool in

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:58,210
general yeah so let's see a sample

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:02,200
widget first do you understand how they

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,330
look like this is a very sample a widget

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,790
that I took from our tutorial about

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,950
creating widgets when you read our

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,549
tutorial you will be able to actually

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:15,220
create your own widget whenever you

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,080
create a widget you get one feature for

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,460
three is the drag-and-drop handle in the

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,820
top left corner and you have a couple of

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,890
other cool things in a widget you can as

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,010
I said before you can define which parts

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:32,200
are actually editable in the HTML

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,340
structures here we define to editable

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,980
parts and you can define different ACF

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,140
settings for each editable inside the

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,530
structure so here for example in the

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,570
title with disallowed tables images we

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,210
just allowed some basic style but in the

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,330
second element we allowed using things

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,130
like lists for example so whenever you

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,500
allow your customers to insert some

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,080
structures which which are repeated in

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,190
the contents widgets are perfect for

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,309
that and let's see add some more

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:10,020
examples of widgets yeah the new Mitch

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:14,049
plug-in in Drupal 8 is actually a widget

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,059
we have some video here the image

00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:19,270
plug-in in Drupal 8 is actually using

00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,520
Drupal dialogues you're free to use

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,400
either Drupal dialogues or built-in

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:30,669
sicky editor dialog windows to write

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:33,549
your own plugins yeah we select some

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,880
image here we can redefine some

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:39,580
alternative text and we can set that our

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,980
image comes with a caption I see that we

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,120
have a caption here at the bottom of the

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:50,260
image and see that the caption actually

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,870
has some ACF roles defined as well you

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,130
are not able to insert this into a into

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,130
a caption and things like that

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:09,320
and we can resize images they and you

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,700
can drag and drop them and basically we

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,280
can do the same thing with your own

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,470
widgets and yeah this is something that

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,700
I told you before you can actually

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:22,070
represent more complex structures in a

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,860
simple form when you want to save them

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:27,680
in a database here we represent a figure

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,270
element with a caption and image just as

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,030
an image element with some data

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,920
attributes so if you are not distribute

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,690
your content into multiple channels or

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,870
if you you know want you have the

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,170
possibility of changing how images with

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:48,620
captions are rendered in the future this

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:53,390
equal weight you do this all right so

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:55,550
end of you yeah let me go a little bit

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,970
into it will be mild would be more into

00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:01,310
details here yeah this is the downcast

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,470
at forum which is saved in the database

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,660
this is this form is returned by C key

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,760
editor when you save an article or

00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,590
switch to the source mode it's just an

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,160
image element with some data attributes

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:16,820
which actually halt the caption

00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,910
information and the opposite element

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:23,150
which is shown in the editor has figure

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,860
image the caption elements and some div

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,390
elements which wrap the whole widget

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,520
which are added automatically by the

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,340
widget plugin so for example we have the

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,110
drag handler element you don't do this

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,790
you know by yourself it's added

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:38,480
automatically by by the widget plugin

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:40,670
when you create a widget and you know

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,640
how does it happen that the simple image

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,690
element is actually replaced with

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,050
actually actually shown with the caption

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,900
in Drupal rupal it comes with a filter

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,000
caption filter which scans for all

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,400
elements with data a caption attribute

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,500
and rubs them with with such a type

00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,630
attempt with such template so you're

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,550
free to edit this template and render

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:06,200
images with caption in your own way and

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,750
yeah the same thing shown in a little

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,450
bit different way we have some operation

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,970
that happens

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,279
on the sick either side the image is

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,309
replaced with some figure and fig

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:20,100
caption elements and see key editor when

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:22,559
it returns the data back it does the

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,080
down casting of this complex form to a

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,510
simple image element and on the Drupal

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:33,559
site it takes those images and again

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:36,480
makes a complex structure from it sorry

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:39,720
one more example of widgets is the

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,360
magics plug in the matrix plugin shows

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,370
you a little bit different thing it's

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,919
applied in instigator that lets you

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,960
create mathematical formulas it's not

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,510
enabled in Drupal 8 by default but you

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,019
can provide a module which enables it

00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:00,299
and this plug-in return returns a span

00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:04,740
element with some la tech markup inside

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:08,880
and what's cool here is that the magics

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:12,389
library is making a mess in dom when it

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,779
works so you can write widgets which use

00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:17,820
an iframe to actually encapsulate

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,730
libraries that you know are troublesome

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,850
for you so you can represent a simple

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:28,860
span element by using an iframe with a

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:30,570
magic inside alright so let's see I have

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,510
just two more examples of widgets I will

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,220
not bore you not much with widgets there

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,070
is a code snippet planning for a ciggy

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,130
editor which returns a beautiful pre

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,110
element with code element inside this

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:47,669
plugin is using at a highlight ejs

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:49,799
library and what it does is this

00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,990
highlight this library actually replaces

00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,179
the text information that you have in

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,820
the cult element with you know hundreds

00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:02,669
of span elements you highlight the

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:04,590
decode so again widgets allows you to

00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:08,039
work with the complex data structure in

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:12,360
ckeditor but it returns back a very

00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:15,929
simple data structure and last example

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,840
regarding widgets this is actually a

00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:20,879
sample plugin chart plugin that i wrote

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,470
by myself while creating this

00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,980
presentation i wanted to see how

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,799
actually

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:29,429
hard to create widgets by following our

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,640
tutorials this plugin is using the

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,580
charge us library and it returns maybe

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,350
you know I will be stupid element it

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,679
returns a diff element with some data

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:43,620
attributes that lets you create a chart

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,600
from it on your website again using

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,630
javascript by using the data information

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,669
from this element and one it does

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,830
internally the this plugin in sticky

00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:56,250
editor is that it takes this div element

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,850
with some data attributes and it adds

00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:03,690
some canvas element to this div element

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:06,540
and runs chart to charge a su actually

00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,820
render the chart in this canvas element

00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,590
but what we actually return is just a

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,919
diff element with some data attributes

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:16,770
so you are free to a low uses a

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,830
different library later to render the

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:22,559
same chart or things like that alright

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:26,850
so let me just summarize the features

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,740
the feature of widgets we can thanks to

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:32,220
widgets we can work with complex data

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,169
structures that will not break you know

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,830
as I said before you can define editable

00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:40,049
but you can define 0 editable to make

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,700
the whole widget not editable unless you

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:46,440
make it editable with some dialog window

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,150
this is also a convenient solution for

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,210
using some external javascript

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:53,370
presentation libraries that even might

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:57,540
break the Dom then you can encapsulate

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:59,549
them with we run my frame you can save

00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:03,360
simpler forms if you like and render

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:06,360
which forms in WYSIWYG when you check

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,600
the simple box tutorial you'll see that

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,760
you actually save the same form that you

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,160
see in WYSIWYG you are not obliged to

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,929
you you know render a different form in

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,610
wysiwyg and you can return the same

00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:25,530
thing that you have in which we actually

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:27,900
and of course when you save simple forms

00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,460
you can transform them using filters in

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,549
Drupal which you can change at any

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,509
moment without having to you know do

00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:38,669
some SQL magic to replace the content

00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:44,219
if you will save you know the final mark

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:46,919
up otherwise alright so let's switch

00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:49,199
topics again I will tell you about

00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,089
writing plugins of course I will not

00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:53,729
explain you how to write plugins for

00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:56,729
sick eater because it's impossible in a

00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:58,729
few minutes I will tell you how you can

00:32:56,729 --> 00:33:00,899
actually enable plugins to Drupal and

00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:02,999
how we can provide your own

00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:07,139
configuration options which allows you

00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:09,809
to do so magic as well alright so any

00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:12,629
new plugins first of all you don't have

00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:14,940
to write your own plugins you can use

00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,739
the one that are already available in

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,749
secret or add-ons repository there are

00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:23,129
over 200 plugins already available but

00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,259
if you like you can write your own

00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:28,739
plugins you can use the skeeter plugin

00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:30,809
sdk for and see tutorials that we have

00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:32,639
there and you can see the sick eater

00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:35,369
widget IDK where we have tutorials as

00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:37,949
well you know as a as developers we

00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:40,079
understood that this is way to teach

00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:43,079
others how to create stuff is to create

00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,239
tutorials if you see that some

00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,279
documentation is still confusing or

00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:49,440
things like that just feel free to get

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,239
in touch with us and you know just point

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,429
us to the weakest point points in our

00:33:51,239 --> 00:34:00,479
documentation alright so now let me show

00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:04,139
you how you can create plugins in Drupal

00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:07,169
to register sick eater plugins and how

00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:09,659
you can make them available in the text

00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:13,349
configure text formats administration

00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,089
interface so the only interface that you

00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:16,679
have to implement when you provide your

00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:19,529
own module is the secret or plug-in

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,349
interface and I surprised how simple it

00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:24,450
is actually you have to just define a

00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:27,389
couple of functions I listed the three

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,700
most important one here you have to

00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,799
define the dependencies if you are

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,859
plugging depends on some other plug-in

00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:36,839
we have to just show the path to plug in

00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,720
Joyce file which is simple of course and

00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:41,309
if you want to provide some

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,079
configuration settings for your plug-in

00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:45,629
you just do this by the get config

00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,349
function and that I'm thats it is it's

00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:50,130
very simple if your plug-in provides a

00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,750
button you

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:55,110
to inform the administration interface

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,210
about this and you have one function for

00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:00,600
that it's called good buttons and its

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,670
really simple again if you want to

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,760
provide your own configuration settings

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,740
in the administration area again you

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,070
have to just implement one function and

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,410
return a simple array to along provide a

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,890
text area or check boxes or whatever

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,920
form elements you want to return here

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:22,650
ads lasting if your plugin should be

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,130
enabled under certain conditions for

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,560
example if you want to provide the list

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,950
style plugin which allows you to style

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,740
an HTML lists you can use the S enabled

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,650
function to enable your plug-in on when

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:40,680
for example the number 8 list button is

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,840
enabled in sticky editor and I'm not

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,210
going to teach you how to do this I will

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,700
not dive into the API details I created

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,710
sample modules for each of the

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,310
interfaces but from this nice combo the

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:56,040
slice combo plugin is actually available

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:58,530
in car so if you want to create your own

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,130
plugins just you know follow that these

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:08,040
drinks and we'll have a really simple

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:10,530
plugins to follow yeah so you are

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,480
probably surprised by the small number

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,210
of configuration options for ckeditor

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,030
that are available in Drupal 8 I think

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,310
this is a really cool because in sicky

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,230
adriel module for drupal 6 and drupal 7

00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,580
i ended up with no zillion of

00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,570
configuration options which are

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:29,220
confusing at the end I believe anyway if

00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,440
you want to extend a list of possible

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,970
configuration options in Drupal 8 we

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,580
have a very simple hook provided by the

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,450
editor module and you are free to do

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:42,870
magic with this so for example we can

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:44,820
set any configuration options including

00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,520
signature scheme so you don't have to

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,770
stick with the default skin that is in

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,840
Drupal 8 we can use for example mono

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:55,200
color skin which provides some colorful

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,150
icons again this is a module that I

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,530
created and you can you know use it as

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,910
an example on how to work with city

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,750
Drupal 8 and Crete

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:10,730
how to create your own modules and it's

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,730
one more cooling related to this

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,510
possibility of changing configuration

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,730
options you can actually enable ICF for

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:24,510
when even when HTML filter is disabled

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:28,970
so with this simple hook you can enable

00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:32,160
ncf even for the full HTML text format

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,140
alright so we are reaching the end of

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,400
this presentation almost just a few

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:41,220
years of few words about the security

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:44,640
Drupal in journals source content as

00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,470
this it doesn't remove any cross-site

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,990
scripting attempts when the data is

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:52,950
saved and this is a potential threat for

00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:55,500
WYSIWYG editors and ICF is not a

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,450
security future in fact it removes

00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,730
elements and things like that but is it

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:03,750
was not designed to remove cross-site

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:06,359
scripting attempts but thankfully Drupal

00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,579
8 is doing a similar thing to what sidra

00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,160
module was doing for Jubal 6 in Drupal 7

00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,109
it actually runs some security filters

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,710
before the content is passed to Ziggy

00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:19,529
editor so you are safe and you don't

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:23,190
have to worry about any hacking attempts

00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:27,630
using easily editors alright so let's

00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:31,470
slide migration I have to admit that

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:33,680
there is no easy way to port cikita

00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,440
profiles from Drupal 7 automatically

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,480
mainly because actually you are freaky

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,700
use any secure distribution you wanted

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,789
to and there was silly enough options in

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,859
the secatur modules so you have to

00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:50,970
somehow part your configuration from

00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,069
Drupal 7 manually if you have never used

00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,020
seiki editor before and you relied on

00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:57,329
things like out to paragraph and things

00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,609
like that there's a WYSIWYG library line

00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:02,490
breaks module which should help you do

00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:05,549
with this if you have never used see

00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:08,839
heater before and you are worried about

00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:12,990
so no markup you can use the migrate API

00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:18,520
actually you have no other option magic

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:20,829
yeah yeah and if you use some custom

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,520
markup you can write plugins or widgets

00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:28,180
to allow editing it in sticky editor

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,530
yeah so that's it you can see this

00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,990
presentation we did happy if you would

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,420
like to check out the slides they show

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,859
to you all the sample modules and

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,569
plugins the dimension during this

00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:40,089
presentation are available in github I

00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:41,980

and i encourage you to leave me some

00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:58,240
feedback yeah I don't present often and

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,760
my English is let's say week so yeah I

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,760
encourage you to leave some feedback

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,760
thank

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:23,880
alright so any questions maybe no no

00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,970
this is already available I just know if

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,040
you launch Drupal 8 beta this week you

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:34,970
will see everything that I shall shout

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,970
here yeah

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,599
I have yeah we do want a whim is

00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,539
actually one of the outers of the

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:12,329
executor module in Drupal 8 so I let him

00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:15,329
answer maybe this question the the

00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:18,869
question was essentially I think Victor

00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:20,369
showed the plugin contextual interface

00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:22,589
you get a triple intellectual interface

00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,349
which allows you to have a secret or

00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:28,650
plugin be enabled based on the context

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:32,130
that it is in but Kevin asks about that

00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,839
whether what whether you have a very

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,180
rich complex or a limited context

00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,660
essentially can you react to any sort of

00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,789
magical complex and for example a URL

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,130
the current user that sort of thing in

00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:47,099
theory you could probably react to the

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,599
current user and current URL but it's

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,230
definitely not designed to do that the

00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:55,019
context that you get are the interns for

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,990
D text formats and for the text editor

00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:00,329
so based on however the user has

00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,160
configured everything related to text

00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:05,670
editing you can react to that so the

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,710
idea is really to enable it whether if a

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,799
certain filter is enabled for example so

00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,869
if filter foo foo and bar are both

00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:14,279
enabled then you show a button that

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,839
allows you to control both in a

00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:18,240
meaningful manner so it's it's meant to

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,220
react to filters and perhaps in a

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,369
complex combination of certain buttons

00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,140
being enabled but in general it should

00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,759
be something that's necessary fairly

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,160
rarely because most things are using

00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:34,529
buttons so it's pretty advanced to use

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:36,180
cases essentially actually congrats for

00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:39,349
him for providing this awesome

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,349
integration with your polite

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:49,140
I have to say something as well because

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,970
as Victor has said they developed seek

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,150
editor widgets especially for Drupal 8

00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,240
because we insisted that that would be

00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,920
present because we believed that it

00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,530
would be instrumental for you guys to

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,480
have a solid framework to innovate and

00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,040
to make cool things that were not

00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,680
impossible to do without such a

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,360
foundation and as he said it was

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,340
prototyped roughly in two days but it

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,890
took many months to get it to a stable

00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:23,760
point so thanks to seek editor for the

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:27,180
big investment there yes so any other

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,920
questions yeah I'm sorry if I I'm not

00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,340
sure the status is something so maybe my

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,300
questions are actually kind of dumb but

00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,040
what's the status of like providing

00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:43,380
widgets for certain modules in Drupal 7

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,450
the ckeditor the ckeditor JavaScript you

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,400
know the rich text editor has widgets in

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,730
a version that's Drupal 7 compatible as

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,970
well I assume as i said before actually

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,800
users have had freedom I with using any

00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:00,390
distribute secure distribution that they

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:03,960
wanted to if your own module would like

00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:09,990
to rely on widgets you can do this I've

00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:12,000
seen sometimes of using widgets to allow

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,760
users to you work with complex

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,520
structures like a no references to some

00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,480
nodes inside the editor and which is a

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,760
perfect tool for that and yeah you are

00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,790
actually free to use widgets in Drupal 7

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,380
this is why I mentioned them here

00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:31,410
because I tell that would be useful also

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,510
not only for Drupal 8 users you will not

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,090
switch you know immediately to you to do

00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:40,050
polite but you can also use widgets in

00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,970
Drupal 7 it's not just my ignorance of

00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,600
seek editor but also maybe the status in

00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:49,020
Drupal 8 but my use case is like you

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,930
know media elements obviously packages

00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,760
figures with like you know some sort of

00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,660
rich that some sort of rich media

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,130
element

00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,320
options and various other things and

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,300
what would be the status may be for the

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,120
drupal 7 media module and then for the

00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,500
drupal 8 media said Laura actually does

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,960
that all work together and where we

00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,580
actually the situation platforms yeah

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,820
the situation could be improved in and

00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,040
Drupal 7 I believe we have some issue

00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:18,120
that is planning for many months already

00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:21,000
but I hope to give a review of a pastor

00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:25,290
it's rated to the media module it's

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,450
about making secure module more more

00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:32,490
aware of planes and we can also target

00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:34,770
this this requirement it's will be hmm

00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:37,650
it might be able to heart we should

00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,480
encourage users to analyse the CDN

00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,960
version which has access to all the

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,370
plugins or to a download theatre with

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,210
the widget plugin because the other

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:50,160
option that you will have actually

00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,440
assuming that user has installed

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,530
security door without the midgets plugin

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,890
is to provide the widgets plugin with

00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:01,530
your module but then this situation is a

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,000
little bit wrong because the widgets

00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,920
plugin that you will provide in your

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,840
module may come from different version

00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,780
of ckeditor that the see that the user

00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,240
is using together with the city no

00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,030
module or the wizard module so the most

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,970
correct solution for that will be at you

00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,100
encourage users to you and not use the

00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:23,550
full very full preset of sikhi editor

00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:26,460
but to use either the CDN version with

00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:28,800
with full or standard hall or to

00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:37,170
download a customized build with the

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:38,970
WYSIWYG sorry with widgets playing I can

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:43,670
answer one bit of that you were asking

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,670
about embedding media for example in

00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,450
yeah so the question is can I use

00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:53,220
something like widgets and for media

00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,470
embedding probably also entity embedding

00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:58,080
in general image galleries potentially

00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,640
can I use that vse cairo to widgets you

00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,620
have a nice editing experience that's

00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,380
kind of the question and the answer is

00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,030
in seven I don't know to be honest if

00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,100
there is any work being done actively to

00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,549
make that work there precisely because

00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,349
as

00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:11,880
indicating it is kind of tricky to

00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:13,410
resolve potential conflicts between

00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,679
different versions because there was

00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:19,229
nothing that ships with Drupal Norwood

00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,449
cql to that module because of licensing

00:47:19,229 --> 00:47:23,130
constraints back then theoretically I

00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,749
guess it's possible today but it's not

00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,509
really accepted to include JavaScript

00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:29,640
libraries in modules in general on

00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:31,709
Google dork so in Drupal 7 is a bit

00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,900
tricky but in Drupal 8 people are

00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:35,429
actively working on the media module and

00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,309
things related to the media module there

00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:41,729
are actually implementing a secure

00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:43,199
widget to easily select so you can

00:47:41,729 --> 00:47:45,239
basically say I want to select a node

00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,459
then you can select which node and you

00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,739
can choose in which View mode to display

00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:51,569
it in and you can even choose to display

00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:53,789
just certain fields and the really cool

00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:55,619
thing is that and within the widget you

00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:58,859
will not see some arcane structure that

00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:01,019
you would see today in a new editor like

00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:03,089
square brackets with a bunch of JSON in

00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:05,999
between something like that no what you

00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:08,459
will see in Drupal 8 or in Drupal 7 if

00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:10,679
they ported back to triple 7 is the

00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:11,999
actual rendered preview of what it will

00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,709
look like on the front end so you will

00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:15,900
see that be able to click on it and then

00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:23,089
get a dialog to change it so that's kind

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:26,880
of that's the target all right so I

00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:31,259
thank you for an awesome job I want to

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:35,249
calm down a d7 status a little known

00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:38,099
fact that is that with a d7 ckeditor

00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:43,499
module you can actually add in plugins

00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:47,549
from like ck plugins from the URL usual

00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:49,469
there add them into and you just

00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:52,439
reference them in the config file for

00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:55,189
ckeditor and most of them just works out

00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:59,309
of box no Drupal coding needed mm-hmm

00:48:55,189 --> 00:49:03,209
also we've been actually where we've

00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:06,719
been using the a ck image to plug in for

00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:08,309
a while the dribble 7 and that's like

00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,029
the basis for the Drupal 8

00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:15,150
implementation yeah and that's a it's

00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:19,309
actually possible to hack it in place in

00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,309
just a couple of hours sort of

00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,599
and what we've done on a few sites is

00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:28,339
that we use standard media module to add

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:32,630
inline images into the body field just

00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:37,190
the normal way and then we have

00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:39,170
installed the image to seek a plug-in so

00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:42,470
that when you double click the image in

00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:45,589
line you get the options from image too

00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:48,230
mm-hmm so that you can align left to

00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:50,240
right add captions and so forth and it's

00:49:48,230 --> 00:50:06,170
just like to our working it just works

00:49:50,240 --> 00:50:08,420
yeah it's sweet thanks yeah we still we

00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:13,009
now have a new version inline editing

00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:16,220
and the iframe yeah and about the letter

00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:18,619
that iframe thing will it always be

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:22,519
there or is it possible to always use

00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:24,950
inline or I believed a friend version of

00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,509
sikhi editor is there because many times

00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,089
the back end theme is different from the

00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:30,799
fronton team so it doesn't make sense to

00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:32,779
actually use in line editor in the

00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:35,150
administration interface because also

00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,069
the HTML structure that is on the front

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,180
end part of Drupal is different from the

00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:40,880
thing that you have in the back end

00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,099
that's why I freind version is used

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,890
because it's you know much safer and it

00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:48,589
makes sense in that context what's the

00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:52,519
answer your question was it doesn't

00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:54,829
break any functionality to use it if we

00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:58,069
use in line editor instead of classic

00:50:54,829 --> 00:51:01,849
editor in the administration back end or

00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:05,029
in front end extra functionality with

00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:07,519
the iframe I don't think the main

00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:10,999
difference when the iframe is used is

00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:14,089
with CSS Styles because when you use

00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:16,099
iframe to render the editable I know

00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:17,930
that I for that the CSS styles for your

00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:19,400
content will not affect the thing that

00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,670
you will see in the editor so for

00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,980
example if for any weird reason you like

00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:28,039
some elements invisible like the strong

00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:30,680
element on your website the element will

00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:32,299
be visible in the classic version of the

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,880
editor which is using an iframe because

00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:37,259
those ties

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,269
not be used there yeah as I said before

00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:41,609
that there is no difference between the

00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:45,420
NIV version of ckeditor in general apart

00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:47,700
from styling and well there are slight

00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:52,259
difference might be in the list of bikes

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:57,599
that it has but no don't tell about it

00:51:52,259 --> 00:52:00,779
to anyone ok thank you alright next

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,029
question if not let's just end this

00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:05,690
session and thank you once again for

00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:05,690
