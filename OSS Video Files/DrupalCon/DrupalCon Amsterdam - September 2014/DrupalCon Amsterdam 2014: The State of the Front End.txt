Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: The State of the Front End
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: eatingsBcwald
Innovations in front end practices and technology continue to push our industry forward. While Drupal approaches a significant milestone with the impending release of D8, let's take a moment to survey the current landscape of front end practice and consider what it means to be a front end person in general, a front ender working with Drupal, and what it means to straddle these two worlds which are increasingly moving in different directions, at different speeds.

this is the state of the front end I'm

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,189
David Wong I'm at eating's and this is

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,040
brian wold not at brian walled one of us

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,469
has a much more easy to remember handle

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,960
let you figure out which one that is we

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,699
are we work for Acquia as evidenced by

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
the shirts and we are both front-end

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,769
developers by a training if not by our

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,550
every day to day experiences and we're

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,680
going a little bit about that later just

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,940
as a show of hands who here saw us talk

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,500
at austin who saw my brain is full okay

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,510
great so this recap section is totally

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,230
useful we didn't know if we were going

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,399
to go over old things we have three

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,180
sections to our talk today we have

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,030
yesterday today and tomorrow and we'll

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,860
talk first about yesterday and some of

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,160
this is going to recap what we talked

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,340
about in our previous talk but it'll be

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,680
good to follow along so last time on my

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,930
brain is full which was the the top of

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,579
mind i gave we talked about how

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,439
front-end has changed a lot i don't

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,680
think anybody here can deny that of all

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,540
the facets of practice that we discuss

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
about a drupalcon front-end has the one

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,070
that is the one that's undergone the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,229
most amount of changes in the shortest

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,270
amount of time drupal 8 change is

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,560
notwithstanding and actually even taking

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,759
into account triple a front and has

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,710
probably changed more than any other

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,390
practice within the drupal aegis in that

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,829
time drupal itself hasn't changed very

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,750
much front-end has changed you know

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,659
we'll talk about this in a little bit

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,840
here but the front-end developer

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,340
experience say starting from 2006 or two

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,950
thousand seven or so to the funding

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,920
experience of 2014 is a dramatically

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,360
different enterprise whereas Drupal is

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,009
still pretty much triple you know you're

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,780
entering things into forums you're you

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,399
know hook altering things and and that

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,829
sort of thing and more importantly than

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,869
that as friend has changed and Drupal

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,240
hasn't we haven't been very good at

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,890
predicting things you know we've laid

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,500
our bets pretty heavily in some places

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,450
and those bets have paid off in say like

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,829
jQuery and then we've also had really

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,890
long bike sheds and discussions about

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,890
things like you know BAM or Oh CSS or

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,310
you know other things where we might not

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,440
have

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,120
on the right side of history and it's

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,120
not even so much about predicting is it

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,880
is you know when Drupal 7 was released

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,890
for instance we had a very set way of

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,870
doing things and so things were kind of

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,750
baked into the CMS in that manner so

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,269
what we expected to see in Drupal 7

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,130
changed dramatically as we got

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,290
throughout the lifecycle of where we are

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,739
in Drupal 7 now which is you know at the

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,540
horizon of Drupal 8 being released so

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,610
this is a slide we used in our last last

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,069
session and essentially what we're

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,440
talking about here is you can't see the

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,480
very bottom oh you can as some dates

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,480
there and what this is talking about is

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,239
the life cycle of Drupal versus the life

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,830
cycle of front-end technologies so you

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,980
know when we when we first launched

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,739
Drupal 7 blueprint grid system 960 grid

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,560
system things like cufon which is you

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,660
know managing your fonts and so forth

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,190
we're kind of the normal and then as we

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,780
progress throughout the time you know

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,180
that changed but Drupal is still exactly

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,560
the same so if you look at that first

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
part of that as I was talking about

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,190
those are those are what we expected

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,420
when we started Drupal 7 and then we go

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,680
to the next part and this is not what we

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,829
expected when we started with rupal

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,060
seven so we have a lot of conflicting

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,810
conflicting pieces of information coming

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,220
to this so we have to kind of retrofit

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,660
what we're using on the front end to

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,299
move it into Drupal so that we can do

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,829
the things that people are expecting in

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:43,530
2014 from their websites to perform the

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,000
gist of this being that front end moving

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,980
way faster than trouville right I don't

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,230
think anybody here it would say wow

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,630
Drupal core development happens at such

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,950
a clip I can't keep up oh maybe you can

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,019
reasonably say that in the last month or

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,519
so but you can't historically you know

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,019
Drupal is geologic time compared to the

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,569
speed of which front-end technologies

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,190
have moved and this is not even counting

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,109
things like just responsive but even

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,180
things like you know today's JavaScript

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,650
framework is yesterday's laughable pile

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,630
of spaghetti you know like there there

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,459
are things on the front end space I

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,769
moved so much faster that that iterate

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,130
and operate and come into and fall out

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,539
of fashion faster than Drupal itself can

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,710
ever keep up with and this includes

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,110
things like contributed modules as well

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,180
and lastly the one thing that we covered

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,200
that was really important and I think

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,960
everybody here would agree

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,980
his front end is a thing like a thing

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,500
thing right front end isn't a front end

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,360
is its own practice it front end is a

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,650
discrete skillset front end isn't the

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,600
place where you just shove your junior

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,740
developers and then say get better at

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,140
this and then you'll write modules one

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,350
day no front end is a distinct practice

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,290
with its own skill set tools and best

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,880
practices that are robust and is solid

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,840
as any other facet of Drupal development

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,280
and this is what can't be undersold this

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,950
is one of those things where you know

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,930
front end developers and Drupal you know

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,620
the Alliance has been not very you know

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,680
very easy at times and and equal footing

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,140
is definitely a thing and ultimately it

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,480
the reality is is that when it comes to

00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,400
the requirements of the web and the kind

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,810
of technology that's driving Drupal

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,520
technology forward it's the front end

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,600
that's pushing it it's not the back end

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:29,100
front end is pushing Drupal Ford not the

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,010
other way around so today not literally

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,170
today but you know today you know after

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,500
those B'nai today's that we just spoke

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,730
of Play It Again Frank okay so Frank

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,850
Camaro does anybody here know who Frank

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,380
Camaro is so Frank Romero is a designer

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,210
formerly the New York Times and other

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,210
August institutions who is rather

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,920
opinionated and writes blog posts and we

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,790
cited a blog post from our previous talk

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,190
I actually asked for a response for him

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,870
regarding that and this is what he wrote

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,370
quote we need to do a better job of

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,500
describing the connective tissue of

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,000
making things for the web everyone in

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,830
describing the one little piece they've

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,900
created but don't explain or even

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,360
reference the larger concepts of how all

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,520
of these elements linked together this

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,380
is in my mind just a symptom of the web

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,240
stack being so deep the more in

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,190
connected interconnected and complex a

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,020
system becomes the more difficult it is

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,190
to tease apart you have to see the

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,750
progress while it's happening to

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,670
decipher it so if you're like me and

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,820
missed out on a couple years you only

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:31,260
see the tangle of Christmas lights Frank

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,660
Camaro on designer news in July 2014 I

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,250
have to preface this every time I quote

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,910
friend Camaro Frank Camaros under the

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,980
age of 35 so he's not a old-timer he's

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,639
not somebody who's you know lost his way

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,830
he's

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,300
somebody our age doing the same things

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,090
we're doing you know having the same

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,199
struggles that we're describing so

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,210
welcome to the new normal the post

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,919
responsive world I wanted to put up an

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,479
even more graphic and destroyed

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,879
landscape but I don't want to think

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,279
responsive is a bad thing it just sort

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,749
of cleared the table and set new rules

00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,490
and I think we're still picking up the

00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:09,840
pieces for you know what it means to

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,699
have our are sort of precious ideals you

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,870
know pre responsive you know be so

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,889
utterly destroyed and reset so the table

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,860
stakes to the new front end game

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:24,930
responsive right responsive it's just it

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,259
responsive is a thing now you know it's

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,610
responsive design isn't expected it's

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,289
expected exactly these are all things

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,689
that are expected now they're expected

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,909
to do responsive respected to manage

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,289
devices that have touch it needs to be

00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,990
performant and that doesn't just mean

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:41,759
you know you're compiling your CSS code

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,029
this means that you're running you know

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,550
tests and console you know evaluations

00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,589
of how your scripts are running your you

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,360
know taking into consideration how the

00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,589
JavaScript libraries work together all

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
of these things you know you're doing a

00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:56,610
lot more engineering than that what was

00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,689
a part of you know the yesterday of a

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,120
front-end as I just said javascript is

00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,089
cool again so it's you know this concept

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,659
of everything has a framework everything

00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:11,219
runs based off of you know everything's

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,659
running in the Dom now we're not doing

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,430
everything from the server side we can

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,409
do a lot of things just straight with

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,969
the JavaScript injected into the site

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,439
which is another reason what's not

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,810
playing super well with Drupal because

00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,199
that's not how it was built to be made

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,659
so go ahead multiple framework so

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,159
everything I think it's everybody here

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:31,050
has played with at least one framework

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,789
in the Drupal I don't does anybody here

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,890
make a Drupal site without a single

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,849
framework CSS JavaScript or otherwise on

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,070
it okay there we go that food for the

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,769
video audience next week that was zero

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,930
people everybody uses a CSS framework of

00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,370
some kind multiple CSS frameworks people

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,800
use multiple JavaScript frameworks if

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,079
necessary you have CSS frameworks on top

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,850
of CSS frameworks you have you know

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,510
their own individual theming you know

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,250
for if you use something like bootstrap

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,550
there's multiple pieces that have to be

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,130
assembled this gives us lots of powerful

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,050
new toys we have a lot of power at our

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,480
disposal now more power than we ever had

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,320
before with all the capabilities that we

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:16,090
have but there's two sides to this so

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,950
good news everybody as a front end as a

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,910
designer and a front ender you have

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,490
almost no limits so for example this is

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,660
huge inc com I'm not this is not when I

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,300
getting paid by them they just had a

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,880
very trendy site scroll jacking flat

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,650
colors you know there's this crazy

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,410
tiling thing that's going on they have

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,060
embedded media you know they have a

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,470
hamburger menu I mean who doesn't love

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,600
the hamburger menu you know this is

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,850
everything 2014 design and bodies right

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,830
flat colors boom and so the bad news is

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,750
a designer friend have no almost no

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,280
limits the exact same problem for

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,010
example let's take a look at this

00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,600
microsoft site same idea but this is

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,070
what i would consider design for design

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,300
sake you know if i were to interview

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,910
these developers they'd probably say

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,590
well that's because i could and not

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,780
because you know we're using these tools

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,190
in the right way so there's two sides of

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,650
the coin and that's and that's that's

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,080
part of the piece of you know where we

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,640
come in as conductors and orchestrating

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:19,150
these things so as designers now we

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,770
design and design dynamically along so

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,690
many more fascists than before it's not

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,570
simply opening a photoshop anymore and

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,160
drawing something interaction design you

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,790
have to consider personalization design

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,010
application design multi devices i it's

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:38,320
so many more axes than were previously

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:39,880
considered normal so for developers

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,860
there's been an explosion of tools that

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,710
help us meet this since in so you know

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,450
we they recognize that and it catches up

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,890
to us is this idea that you know we're

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,190
always we're always chasing something

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,590
here so for example some of the sets of

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,930
the automation testing performance

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,630
leveraging new features managing the

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,190
browser in context writing less code d

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,520
ry which is you're probably all familiar

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,680
with do not repeat yourself keeping up

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,360
the pace with the checks and modularity

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,579
so that you can swap things in and out

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,380
you know using front ends that are not

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,329
Drupal facing not using the template

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,450
system you know quote unquote headless

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,920
Drupal for instance and building

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,390
repeatable units for functional

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,829
functionality so spoiler alert looking

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,980
for you there sessions on all of these

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:30,380
topics let's kick it back people or so

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,390
all of these on testing on automation on

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,480
performance on new features for browsers

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,700
and in languages managing your browser's

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,260
context and and things like writing less

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,870
code keeping your pieces to check I

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,920
think there's two sessions on layouts

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,990
non Drupal front ends there's I think

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,089
three sessions on non-joking front ends

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,440
and then John album here in the front

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,120
row is talking about things like web

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,980
components that is packaging up

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,110
functionality you know in a more meta

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,970
way than we've ever done before we there

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,320
are sessions on the front and track and

00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,820
also a little beyond the front end track

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,279
as well that everybody should go see

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,560
because these are the new normal for a

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,760
drupal developer and you should be up to

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:11,899
date on these things because we say so

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,529
no so as expectations and capabilities

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,000
have grown for your website your web app

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,110
so have the tools and practices emerge

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,180
to meet them so these things aren't

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,649
coming out of the ether these aren't

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,170
things that have just magically sprung

00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,760
up for no good reason whatsoever it's

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,560
because people wanted to do something

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
new they wanted to be able to fill in

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,620
functionality didn't have before they

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,570
wanted to to to be to have tools to make

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,550
these things easier the goal of these

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,899
techniques and these practices is to

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,240
make your life easier to make it

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,220
possible not to make your life harder

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,120
even though they might do that as a side

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,310
effect note though many if not all of

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,010
these practices are outside of Drupal

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,779
your CSS frameworks Drupal doesn't care

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,820
your JavaScript remix Drupal doesn't

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,940
care all of these things the modern

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,709
front end or skill sets are mostly non

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,390
Drupal centric the things that you have

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,279
to know is a front-end ur concern

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,110
themselves mostly outside of Drupal and

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,709
Drupal is sort of a secondary if not

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,120
tertiary concern to you which is I think

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,709
kind of ironic given that we're giving

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,209
the first talk in the front end at a

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,730
Drupal caught but it is it is the

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,020
reality that we face so yeah and going

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,910
off of that you know the complexities

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,180
aren't always just about building it's

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,740
not always about

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,660
you know having a hard time managing

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,490
your grunt tasks or whatever it may be

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,490
that you're doing for your website these

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,470
are also you know business concerns as

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,620
well take for example you know when you

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,420
built the site in 2008-2009 you could be

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,640
very predictive you could you can make

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,900
really really educated guess on how long

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,490
it's going to take you to build the

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,440
front end of that and that's not so much

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,020
the case anymore you know a lot of times

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,490
we're seeing budgets go way over way

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,810
over and beyond what you expected

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,070
because there's just a lot of components

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,270
that you just can't take into

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,210
consideration you know when you're

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,980
getting into a lot of different devices

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,600
way that things are interaction patterns

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,330
that haven't been thought about when you

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
get into an iPhone or an Android device

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,940
for instance and become very complex and

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,430
in the other side of that is that when

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,460
you do actually scope something you know

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,380
relatively accurate to what it takes to

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,240
do in the front end now you have another

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,730
problem and that's that clients say well

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,680
I used to be able to build a website you

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,180
know the front the design piece of it

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,790
the front end piece of it only took you

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,800
know 70 hours why is it taking 400 now

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,270
what's what's what's changed I don't get

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,340
that and so they don't understand that

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,320
how fast this has changed means that

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,400
it's a lot it's a lot more complex and

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,770
there's a lot more that we have to

00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,930
manage and you can't just make a site

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:45,240
mobile so tomorrow and not literally

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:47,580
tomorrow but the figurative tomorrow so

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,260
we came out of the 90s where you know

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,670
this was your this is web design this is

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,350
web development right shove it into a

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,690
table make the table as complex as you

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,690
need to boom it's done a lot of people

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,710
still do it this way and this is what

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,500
you were designing for these are your

00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,000
targets you had a clunky PC or a Mac you

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,680
had these two browsers and you had these

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,970
two viewports maybe even just one of

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,980
them to concern yourself with so now

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,300
this is more likely what you're dealing

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,560
with when you're taking a look at a

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
project now these are all the things

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,910
that you have to take into consideration

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,670
you have to consider you know ten

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,520
different devices five browsers at least

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,590
a ton of viewpoints not only you know

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,150
when it's it's it's just looking at a

00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,550
dude but also if they rotate it into

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,050
portrait or landscape mobile view is

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,730
what happens when somebody uses touch

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,120
how are all those things taking into

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,680
consideration those are

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,180
much bigger problems to be solving than

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,940
we used to be solving when in

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,370
development of these websites and

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,500
unfortunately that list is never going

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,610
to grow shorter it's never going to grow

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,380
shorter it's only going to get bigger

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,420
like there is no unwinding the clock and

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,950
going back to the 90s so where does this

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,960
take us so the front end there's always

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,730
be chasing the next big thing I mean

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,830
that's that's that's oh but you know

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,839
this concept of us chasing thing is not

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,770
is not something that is going to go

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,570
away and it's not something that's

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,770
particularly new you know this is

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,970
something that's been going on for a

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:12,160
long time for example here here's here's

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,460
here's a video that we just pulled from

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,990
from the keynote of that i watch release

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,630
and this is just a short snippet of this

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:24,120
but I would like to play for you for ya

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:27,100
if you take a gesture like pinch to zoom

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,470
let's try that again over here it covers

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,839
the content it up stroke oh did you

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,690
disagree well it only plays play on the

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:39,060
pickle yeah for example if you take a

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,060
gesture like pinch to zoom

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:49,110
it covers the content it of structure

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:52,140
view it just doesn't work so we placed

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,170
extra functionality in a mechanism

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,200
that's been on the watch for decades

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:00,120
it's this dial it's called a crown and

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,679
on the Apple watch it's called the

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,230
digital crown the digital crown includes

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:14,699
infrared LEDs some photos not supposed

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:21,240
to stop okay so the idea here hold on

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:26,189
let me get back to having a little bit

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,429
of a difficulty here doesn't let me

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,429
switch

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:43,820
darn you Apple so who's ready to build

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,529
some dial base front end right this this

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,389
idea that oh yeah we figured it out now

00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,889
oh we don't phones we got it we've got

00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:51,529
phones down we've got tablets down oh

00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:53,090
great now we have to create for a watch

00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,889
and it's not just a smaller device it

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,289
has this dial and this is interface and

00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:59,860
we hadn't considered before and why are

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:04,519
you disturbing my my comfortably held

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,850
mastery of responsive front end so and

00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,110
we are kind of you know this is sort of

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,240
a point that we're making it lets a

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,960
little ridiculous but it's not either

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,820
because it's the reality I mean it new

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,440
devices come out new techniques come out

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,909
new design patterns come out and you

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,039
have to respond to that and you have to

00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:24,409
be able to meet the needs of the of what

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,210
works the expectations are so it is very

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,940
possible in one year from now you may be

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:33,559
designing for interface on a watch it's

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,240
very possible so so here it is so so the

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,799
goal this is you know what we wanted to

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,080
talk with you guys about here today this

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,700
goal is to be truly device independent

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,259
design and development you know for

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,149
example headless drupal that is such a

00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,769
popular trend right now api driven

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:47,750
drupal which is the same idea which is a

00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:49,909
essentially being able to normalize your

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,620
content normalize how things are

00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,600
displayed in letting the device make the

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,860
decisions on how that works what's the

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,200
best design pattern for that device

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,480
doesn't always have to be you know

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,399
starting with the mobile or starting

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,840
with web and then and then making it

00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:05,090
work on every other device you know

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,730
that's that kind of technique as you've

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,559
seen as we've as everything's getting

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,240
more complex as there's more devices as

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,639
more browsers as there's more screen

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,080
resolutions is never going to work and

00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:19,309
you're always going to be becoming more

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,740
complex to manage so this isn't

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,000
something that just front Enders are

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,889
working with I mean it's a problem for a

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,629
lot of people and it's unfortunate that

00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:29,240
Jeff eaten isn't here has anybody seen

00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:31,009
Jeff eating talk about about the battle

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,600
the body field or his content strategy

00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:36,740
talks has anybody okay yeah it's anybody

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,389
seeing the Karen McGrane talk from

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,269
drupalcon two years ago about content

00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:42,830
strategy and so similar ideas exist

00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,779
outside the finite world and in the

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,850
content strategy world as well that the

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:49,640
idea that we are writing

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,490
dining publishing and developing for a

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,890
set number of context is a fool's errand

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,200
and that we're going to be we can

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,790
continuously chase that down that rabbit

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,920
hole forever and never come out winners

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,960
there the idea that we can just you know

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,850
pick oh we just add today's device to

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,260
the list of devices that we support and

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,270
drop this other one off the list when it

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,490
becomes deprecated is a fool's errand

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,380
like that's never going to be a winning

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,570
strategy that's always going to be just

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,340
piling on more work for you building

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,990
fragile sites and only kind of work or

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,940
target specific devices I mean who

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,550
remembers the days of activex right you

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,900
know like they're like that kind of idea

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,270
specifically targeting context and

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,340
devices is not going to win and in the

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,880
end what we need is something that's

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:34,310
much more ecumenical something that's

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,930
much more that much less device centric

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,490
that's much less contact centrex that

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,380
the content that you can display

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,870
anywhere the site that you can view on

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,420
any device the design that accommodates

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,800
tons and tons of context irrelevant of

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,200
whether it's a privilege one or not

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,730
that's the goal and grant it it's a bit

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,710
of a you know it's a bit of a unicorn

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,620
but you know it is nothing wrong with

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:59,300
setting their sights high and so this

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,850
idea of chasing this idea of always

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,110
being one step behind it in technology

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,070
is not a new one and it's not as

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,610
something that's going to go anywhere

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,940
either for example I have a video here

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,850
from a lecture in 1969 with the

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,660
philosopher Alan Watts who was talking

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:19,400
to the IBM engineers about the problem

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,770
of this exact problem he's talking about

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,320
the problem that technology is moving so

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,970
fast that you'll never keep up you'll

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,350
never keep up with it and so this play a

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,720
quick piece of that and this is when

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,040
he's talking about managing catalogs

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,540
which is you know a little different

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,040
contacts but it's the same idea but it's

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,620
exactly the same in almost any other

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,840
field there's an information explosion

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,760
like a population explosion how on earth

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,760
are you go to scan all that information

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,340
yes of course you can get computers to

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:57,050
help you in this direction but by

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,470
Parkinson's Law the soon sooner you

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,960
become more efficient into

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,429
yes the more the thing is going to

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,140
develop so that you will have to have

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:08,250
more efficient computers still to

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:14,190
assimilate all the information you'll be

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:18,030
ahead but only for a short time so see

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,799
if I can get back to my what did you do

00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,740
last time to make this girl just click

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:26,669
on the outside there you did it there

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,870
you see is this problem of the children

00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:38,880
Alan 1 i'm watching us from the grave

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:42,470
alright think I yeah alright maybe and

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:49,440
then click on this back here right no

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:52,650
what did you do does nothing this is we

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,730
good for enjoying all technology using a

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:58,890
JavaScript library to manager slideshow

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,970
ambitious front-end developers reveal

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,740
will fail you sorry so the the operative

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,539
quote here you'll be ahead but only for

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,890
a short time and that's really kind of

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,600
what front-end development is these days

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,970
right you catch up your ketchup you

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,400
catch up and you kind of get ahead and

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,900
you discover this library that fixes

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
things for you and like BAM I've got

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,750
this touch thing saw solved right or

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,400
I've got this CSS library boom I finally

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,590
have this breakpoint thing nailed right

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,970
or that but it's only for a short time

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,400
none of that's permanent you know

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,799
they're called hacks for a reason I mean

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,590
these things these tools that we build

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,490
for ourselves to to make Drupal do the

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,200
things that we needed to do art did you

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,000
know shims that they're little wedges

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,370
that we shove into Drupal to make it

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,940
work the way that we want it to work

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:50,220
because it wall is moving so slowly and

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,059
to continue to develop a practice around

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,140
that it is foolish and then Brian and I

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,610
have been talking about this a lot

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,880
lately and you can't build forever on

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:05,789
top of hacks like there has to be a

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,940
better way than this yeah and so you

00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,860
know essentially here what we wanted to

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,580
get to at this point is we wanted to

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,380
talk about we

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,760
we wanted to since this is one of the

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,670
beginning sessions of the front end

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,860
track we wanted to challenge you guys we

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,390
wanted to talk with you guys about you

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,400
know stepping outside of your

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,710
professional work day and thinking in

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,930
terms of what you're doing right now

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,940
with CSS and sass and your front-end

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,670
technologies and taking a step back and

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,560
say is this sustainable and and if not

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,990
if you agree with us that this is not

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,280
sustainable what are s'what are some

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,960
better ways of handling this you know

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,850
what why you know what we brought up

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
last drupalcon about head looks Drupal

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,810
and then that turned into such a big

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,800
thing is is because I think everyone

00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,230
it's kind of on the tip of everyone's

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,970
tongue that we can't keep going on this

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,260
way the way that we're developing right

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,030
now and we need to take a step back and

00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,130
think about how we can manage content

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,770
how we can have a CMS that manages

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,750
content and delivers it on the front end

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:06,630
in a seamless way that is sustainable

00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:08,460
and maintainable as well so it jumped

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,400
ahead of it so this is kind of our

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,980
challenge so we don't have Pat answers

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,810
and as we get to go first you know we're

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,300
not expected to have pan answers but we

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,650
do have a challenge for you and it's as

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,820
much a challenge for ourselves that is

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,520
for everybody else who's attending this

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,020
room design is and how it looks and the

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,460
front end isn't just about style and

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,260
those who have come to this session

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,290
expecting to talk about designing things

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,550
better or how to style things better we

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,440
have a greater challenge for you and

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,760
that's to learn something new this week

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,440
that's beyond that think bigger than

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,970
making things pretty think bigger than a

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,600
new tool that you can add to your front

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,070
end toolbox think bigger learn something

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,900
contribute your voice to the

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,360
conversations here the front end in

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,060
Drupal 8 is extremely fluid right now

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,740
and there's a lot of contribution that

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,230
is yet to be done and there's a lot of

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,820
voices that have not yet been heard and

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,170
there's a lot of sessions that are gonna

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,690
be talking about the things that are

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,070
available to you and what we'd like for

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,020
you for those who are interested and

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,290
still sticking around for Thursday is to

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:13,050
come back and reconvene on thursday at 2

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,030
15 p.m. and talk to us about what you've

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,710
learned and talk to us about what you've

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,360
taken away from your sessions and talked

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,270
about the things that have challenged

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,650
you because we want to close the loop a

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,060
little bit on this conversation we don't

00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,960
just poke you and st. you have to build

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,760
the strategy

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,409
you know that's my goals I want us to

00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,330
sit down and say let's let's think of a

00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:31,740
strategy as we move into Drupal 8 you

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,750
know we have a lot better templating

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,399
system and Drupal a twig of course but

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,929
that's not that's not the end all be all

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:38,250
you know managing our JavaScript

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:42,299
libraries becoming easier all of those

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,649
things but what I want to know is what

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,480
where are we going to go from there you

00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,919
know that's that's how we manage the

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,539
today how are we going to manage the

00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,610
tomorrow when it becomes more complex

00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:57,289
and more things to manage so I think at

00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:00,419
that point we have a thank you slide and

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:03,690
in our handles well so you can he's

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,919
brown bald I'm Brian Walden you can undo

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:10,350
it along talking about that if you'd

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:13,770
like we were told that we must be rated

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:17,640
and so this slide is a courtesy of

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:19,230
drupalcon Stephanie Amsterdam so yeah I

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,460
think at this point it would you know we

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,470
do have a fair amount of time it would

00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,419
be good to talk to you guys and if you

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,419
have questions please let us know

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,169
I don't know if there's a mic for this

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,110
room but if anybody wants to we'll take

00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:45,679
hansa probably am I ya hands and or just

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:53,590
open outcry clearly no questions done

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,590
wow that was easy all right Louis yes hi

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,190
so Luis asked if there's any existing

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,720
outside tools for front-end do we see

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,809
any new envision any of them coming into

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,809
Drupal core or intercont rib I see a lot

00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,679
of things going to contribute core

00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,690
there's already been so those who

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:22,070
haven't looked at Drupal 8 very recently

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:23,990
modernizes in core backbone is in core

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,789
weirdly enough there are not real

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,740
projects that are ready in court but I

00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,620
don't know if adding things more things

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,830
in the core is the way to go well it

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,360
also a one of the battery pieces I think

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,740
about that is that we've removed things

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,929
in the sense that we don't have the

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,909
dependency of jQuery for instance on the

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,590
front end anymore you'll find that out

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,090
if you start to load a theme and try to

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,409
write some jQuery without loading the

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,530
library you won't be able to do that

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,850
anymore so I think that's actually the

00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,130
better direction is being a little bit

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,600
more agnostic but making it simple for

00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:01,720
people to add in what they need at that

00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:01,720
right time to do that John

00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,430
so

00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,519
John asked so we made the point in

00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,960
triple coniston that it's almost

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,909
impossible to know everything there is

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,070
to know about Drupal's front end systems

00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:38,629
like know the entire breadth everything

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,879
available to us front row front in

00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:42,889
finding practice you know abstract front

00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:45,139
end practice in general I kind of feel

00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:46,820
that still true i think part of the

00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:48,499
problem is that you're not only expected

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,210
it all up front and practice you're also

00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:52,070
expected to know all the weirdness of

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,960
drupal as well and that's like already

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,519
two brains worth of things right you got

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,110
you have to to be a really really

00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,210
proficient front-end developer you have

00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,700
to know all this I think we termed

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,230
Drupal like in our last talk

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,090
and it's kind of true like you have to

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,769
know all these other things about Drupal

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,809
that are in no way intuitive to any

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,669
other system and bespoke to triple

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,590
itself and you have to be an expert in

00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:14,539
backbone or you have to be an expert in

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,820
jquery and you don't have to know this

00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:18,350
CSS system you know you no soup to nuts

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,879
and I don't think that's a reasonable

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,470
proposition to make and I think Drupal 8

00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:23,990
does make step strides in the right

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,299
direction towards you know making it

00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:29,629
less dependent on knowing that Drupal

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:33,950
eNOS but I'm not certain it goes far

00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:35,899
enough you know I you know did so in

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,039
conversations with others you know one

00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,539
of the things that's always come up is

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,549
like why do front end developers leave

00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,690
Drupal right and the your friend of

00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,950
developer is leave dribble for variety

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,139
reasons for a lot of them is that

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:48,289
wrestling with the Drupal Beast becomes

00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:50,480
less fruitful than rolling your own note

00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:52,190
app or you know working with react yes

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,100
or you know whatever sexy front-end

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,230
framework you like and there's something

00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,850
to be said that being our competition

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,440
you know like as developers that's

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,360
really the competition that we are

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,220
measuring Drupal against like what how

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,419
easy is it to build you know it's easy

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,220
to build Drupal sites for these

00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,539
following reasons but from the front end

00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,730
how do we measure up against this

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,559
alternative system all other merits

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,690
aside you know taken away you know say

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,980
nothing about content modeling to say

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,499
nothing of you know like complex

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,610
architectures how easy is it to quote

00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:25,070
unquote dima site in angular versus

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:28,309
drupal and i think for once you hit a

00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,720
certain proficiency level the scales tip

00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:32,679
in the opposite direction against Drupal

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,679
then then with

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:50,470
any more questions so everything 20 hey

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:54,250
good oh my favorite Brian favorite tools

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:59,790
and frameworks today in Drupal or just

00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:01,990
in general well I I think that there's I

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,510
personally like to run everything on a

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,620
node and run an angular front end but

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,170
that's because I work on the angular

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,210
project so I having a little bit biased

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,130
but I think that you know some of the

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,290
really cool things that excite me about

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,790
where front end is going is actually

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,920
some of the tools that are just managing

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,900
these all of these libraries and

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,730
managing all these tasks for instance

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,580
grunt right you know running grunt or

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,500
aunt or one of those methods for

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,330
compiling and doing a lot of the you

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,070
know the heavy lifting for you so you're

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,710
not constantly managing those things

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,770
over and over again you're able to you

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,690
know run your land you're able to run

00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:40,510
compressions you're able to you know

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,870
just manage a lot more in making making

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,550
your life a lot easier so when you get

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,590
into situations where you're running an

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,630
angular app and then all of a sudden you

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,160
you know if some other developer comes

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,900
in and wants to strip that out you can

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,690
make those kind of modular changes

00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,690
easily that way please

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,690
the question was do you think that web

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,580
components and polyfills will decrease

00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,080
their complexity of the front end John

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:16,169
who's sitting in the first row is giving

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,880
a talk on web components sorry presence

00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:21,409
presidents there's a precedent is doing

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,679
a session on web components and and

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:26,820
John's doing one design components um

00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,470
Brandon are a big fan of components like

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,570
in the lower case C sense breaking up

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,620
manageable chunks of things whether they

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,019
be in a single language of multiple

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,169
languages that you came packaged and

00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:40,019
then reuse that's the overall trend of

00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:43,559
things in front end the you can argue

00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,480
its maturity in the Drupal space but you

00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:51,899
know the general the wind is blowing in

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:53,460
that direction know if we were yeah as

00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,679
much yes as I can I don't look foolish a

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,159
year from now but you will say yes for

00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,210
now sure and part of the talk is I you

00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,500
know a lot of people look like idiots

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,960
now for saying we should have put

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,360
blueprint into in the you know Drupal

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,190
core and you know how fun would that be

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,629
overriding blueprint every Drupal site

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,830
you make now well you laugh but that's

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:12,990
the same thing that people are doing a

00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,909
Drupal a now too yeah these things in

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,349
here and then in a year that's not going

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,750
to be relevant anymore so that's why I'm

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,429
a big fan of making it available to swap

00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:25,560
those things out as you need them rather

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:28,879
than forcing something down them any

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,879
other questions so you please

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:49,320
what we had to place bets on what might

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:54,330
not be smart to have put into Drupal 8

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:57,720
oh boy well I mean if you if you are

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,790
someone who was of the mindset that you

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,609
know headless Drupal and content API

00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:05,550
driven Drupal I think that that would be

00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:07,290
anything on the front end right because

00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,270
if you if you have a template system

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,270
like twig right which we r is much

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,160
improved over the original with the PHP

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,430
template system that we're using right

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,950
now that system still isn't going to be

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,990
sufficient for headless necessarily I

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,650
mean it serves a better purpose into

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:27,000
that you can take the you know the

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,470
content out of the site and be able to

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,780
display that in the template system but

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,390
using any templates is forcing any

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,980
template system inside the CMS is going

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,570
to you know make that a harder issue

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,890
there's two sides to that though because

00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,420
then what happens with those people that

00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,400
don't want to do that and they just want

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,630
to run a Drupal site then they don't

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,920
have they don't have a theme layer

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,900
that's not going to that doesn't work

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,310
for people either so I think that you

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,750
know when you're when you're working at

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,430
a project such as Drupal where your

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,650
catering touch such a large audience you

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,210
have to you have to knowingly make some

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,220
decisions that you're like right this is

00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,099
this is the best thing that we've got

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,119
right now so let's go with that and you

00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,190
know maybe that's not going to be the

00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,180
best decision later but you know you can

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,000
say that about anything you know

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,300
hindsight's twenty-twenty so I do think

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,859
that the what we have chosen to go in

00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,869
there makes a lot of sense i think that

00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:14,820
like i said earlier the idea that now we

00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,290
have the libraries the ammo file for

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,640
pulling at all of your javascript

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,589
libraries or however you want to manage

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,710
it is a lot more maintainable than it

00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:25,910
was before so those types of things I

00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,910
think are steps in the right direction

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:41,290
what's the state of external libraries

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:46,320
in Drupal 8 in triple-a is thao in the

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:48,310
room hey thao VI auto no he's not I

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,290
couldn't tell you as of the last two

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:55,600
weeks none of that's changed or not but

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,250
Te'o by Avila is is the core maintainer

00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
of JavaScript he's giving a core

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,450
conversation of JavaScript in Drupal 8

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,480
core later this week that would be a

00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:07,900
great question to ask now or not he's

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:15,010
also goes he goes by not as well anybody

00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:17,770
else yes Louis was your hand up over on

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,010
the head somewhere no okay I don't think

00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,010
so

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,830
you

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:34,070
would it be a good idea to put sass in

00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:36,320
the Drupal core yeah who said no who

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,060
said oh ok so Morton says no ok yeah i

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,150
would i would go with no as well and

00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:44,780
that one save the same idea though right

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,310
so you know that that doesn't compile on

00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,410
the server side and things along those

00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,670
lines so in the front at why yeah i

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:54,170
don't think that you can force those

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:56,420
types of ideas onto a platform that runs

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,470
that way i don't know i think that that

00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,300
would be a step in the wrong direction

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,630
the same way i think that you know

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,720
forcing jquery to run it would be the

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,100
wrong assumption as well so hey Mike

00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,570
Greene yeah why don't you can be seen

00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:15,760
with the jQuery update and it's you

00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:15,760
that's true Jacob Uribe right right

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:28,550
that's true now or the hamp near the

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:30,380
hamon mount real right so John said that

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,780
there's multiple ways to compile sass

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,330
you can pilot verbose debugging you can

00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,840
you the way that that notes asked right

00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:40,220
we SAS live yeah or then what library is

00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,480
Ronnie do you have to run compass you

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,950
know are you going to force those types

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,090
of things are you going to run scotch I

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,800
mean there's there's a lot of different

00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,900
routes that you could have for managing

00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,040
your mix and libraries as well so if

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,780
you're going to go down the SAS route

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,120
then what else would you add because

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:57,310
that's not always enough anyway so none

00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,310
is probably better than one in that case

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:03,880
any more questions it oh sorry anybody

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,880
else

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,309
going once going twice great thank you

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,609
very much for coming you guys appreciate

00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,609
