Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: lornajane
A practical, no-rhetoric session on what objects are and why they might be useful to developers. We'll start with a little theory and then move on quickly to some practical examples of what you'll see in an OOP PHP project. From classes, objects and inheritance, we'll move on to file structure and autoloading code in PHP. This session will also cover more advanced concepts such as traits and interfaces, and discuss how they allow us to build more powerful, flexible applications with less code to maintain. Developers who attend this session will be able to tackle their next OOP project with confidence.
