Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Sell Anything to Anyone, Anywhere (Commerce Without Borders)
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: rszramaGuGuss
For the last five years Commerce Guys has pursued its vision to develop the leading open source eCommerce framework on Drupal. As our footprint grew internationally, our understanding of such a framework likewise grew to include the tools and systems required to sell anything to anyone anywhere. Recent developments in the Drupal Commerce 1.x contributed module ecosystem and in Drupal Commerce 2.x itself highlight just how far weâ€™ve come in providing global support for currencies, price formatting, addressing, and more.

As of this Summer, with the launch of Platform.sh to the general public, we now also provide development teams with the tools they need to launch their projects even faster. Additionally, the tools we developed to drive our recurring billing and voucher systems are now available to power your next digital commerce project!

In this session, Ryan and Augustin will showcase these latest developments at Commerce Guys with a special focus on the business value they bring to our partners and customers.

I already hopefully you intend to be in

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,069
the business showcase session for

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,980
commerce guys we have titled it sell

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,519
anything to anyone anywhere because they

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,760
asked for a title before we had content

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,939
so we ran with it and we will be

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,100
providing more or less in an update on

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,720
both Drupal commerce and platforms SH

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,630
the two primary things that commerce

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,250
guys does including you know how it's

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,289
bringing value to our partners and our

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,020
you know direct customers and clients

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,660
I'm just a brief bit of background and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,940
commerce guys we are five year old

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,700
Drupal agency based in Paris London in

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,629
ann arbor michigan we formed the company

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,809
to be experts in drupal e-commerce at

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,329
the time i had just released ubercart to

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,760
on Drupal 6 and we merged forces with

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,280
the team from Paris to then relaunch our

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,660
efforts around drupal commerce and

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,699
that's now you know continuing to grow

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,079
and do its thing we're here at the booth

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,629
to talk about where it's going in the

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,240
future and in the meantime we've also

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,920
decided to build a hosting platform that

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,340
manages the full development and

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,689
production lifecycle of any in a Drupal

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,890
project not just a drupal commerce

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,200
project but obviously we built it

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,420
specifically for our own projects first

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,950
and have now made it more generally

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,770
available so August and we'll talk more

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,720
about that we we didn't feel good

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,250
talking about ourselves a whole lot and

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,509
introducing the session so I'm going to

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,369
let him introduce me and then I'll

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,030
introduce him we're going to see who can

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:37,290
sort of strike the lowest blow so I

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,390
introduce you right nah man so yeah I'm

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,579

Ryan already right he's been the founder

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,530
of one of the founder of Commerce guys

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,670
and he's built on his own almost on his

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,070
own you broke out for Drupal 6 it's your

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,200
daughter right on the on the picture yes

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,840
yeah right so it's his daughter he has a

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,299
incredible family and now he's he's been

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,100
the technical lead on drupal commerce 10

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,280
decks the one that you currently play

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,409
with and he is also an architect an

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
architect of double commerce two decks

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,200
that we're going to introduce you that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,810
he's going to introduce you today

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,940
and by saying selling anything to anyone

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,010
anywhere he's selling Hamish cheese in

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,200
the u.s. so with Drupal commerce so

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,560
that's very true and otherwise known as

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,890
Amish if you don't have a French accent

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,069
Hamish Ferguson is also a merchant and a

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,800
user of Drupal Commerce sorry okay um he

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,349
sells his and her t-shirts using drupal

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,890
commerce hosted on platform that Sh this

00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:40,510
is his kind of standing it's a model

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,489
right and you tell us all that you're

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,430
married to her I can't remember it's

00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,380
also my wife okay yeah oh yeah okay erga

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,500
stan is the the product delivery manager

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,230
for us at Commerce guys so he's the one

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,510
directly responsible now as of like six

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,190
days ago for making sure that we have

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,310
platform releases on time and other

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,099
product releases on time and so that's

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,410
who we are and as an overview of the

00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,380
four topics will be covering it will be

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,730
a drupal commerce TX update which is the

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,610
next version of Drupal commerce

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,349
targeting Drupal 8 and then also still a

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,000
look at where the contributed module

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,100
ecosystem is today for drupal commerce

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,829
one because we aren't all rushing out to

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,970
build Drupal 8 websites I imagine and

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,030
then august and will give us an update

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,730
on the platform SH launch that happened

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,650
this summer and the voucher system that

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,600
now sort of drives our free access

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,709
system that is also available to anybody

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,019
else building a software-as-a-service

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,940
tool that needs that sort of billing and

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:41,079
voucher capability so without further

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,569
ado diving into Drupal commerce I don't

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,750
believe he's in here Boyan I don't see

00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,519
him okay boyens ivanovic is the Drupal

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,299
commerce to that X lead developer and my

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,459
co maintainer now of the project and we

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,680
sort of gave him a trial by fire in

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,799
paris in june and july where we brought

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,540
all of our like seat partner CTOs and

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,090
other e-commerce application developers

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,160
and architects to our offices in paris

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,530
to host an architecture sprint where we

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,760
more or less made Boyan defend his ideas

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,669
for the future so we had fabiane potency

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,349
a from symphony or cynthia labs and a

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,269
variety of other folks including others

00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,760
symphony based ecommerce applications

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,620
join us to validate the proposed

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,040
architecture for drupal commerce to

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,680
which involve

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,810
first of all moving code out of drupal

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,700
into generally available PHP libraries

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,830
that I'll introduce in a minute the idea

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,840
being now that we have a Drupal 8 core

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,910
that depends on Symphony and has

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,140
composer as a sort of core package

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,120
management or dependency management

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,460
solution we could take advantage of that

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,070
as well and move code out of our Drupal

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,720
modules into widely generally available

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,270
modules to attract perhaps greater

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,040
consensus from the PHP community to

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,750
contribute to and use these components

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,550
so things like address management

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,960
pricing and whatnot that are similar

00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,120
challenges for all the e-commerce

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,980
applications not just for Drupal users

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,600
we're trying to build consensus and

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,000
bring bring more people to the table too

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,000
I guess maybe expand the influence of

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,100
our solutions and so that's what

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,430
happened in Paris while we were there we

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,820
did first validate a new proposed I

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,950
guess entity relationship model so in

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,680
commerce 1x if you're familiar at all we

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,500
have 5 entity types that we have defined

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,600
to extend Drupal including products line

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,730
items orders customer profiles and

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,950
payment transactions they're all strung

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,900
together using custom reference fields

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,150
that sort of provide a reference

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,400
implementation of e-commerce out of the

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,740
box in Drupal 7 and then of course it's

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,100
up to each site developer or maintainer

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,400
to I guess add additional functionality

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,080
to this base framework so what's an

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,760
example shipping for example is not

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,100
covered here so if you need to track

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,510
shipments and deliveries and have those

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,340
matched up against specific line items

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,590
or specific payments for the purposes of

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,910
refunds or taxing like that's something

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,430
that you sort of have to add to your

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,980
Drupal site using some contributed

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,260
module in our ecosystem and so we sort

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,530
of looked at it decide do we need to do

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,500
more as a core concern can we do less in

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,950
some cases and we arrived at our

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,750
commerce to X entity relationship model

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,790
which will only briefly mention is using

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,830
entity reference field in core for

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,960
Drupal 8 now to tie all of our entities

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,880
together so we no longer have these sort

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,220
of one-off use case specific reference

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,650
fields like we do in commerce 1x that

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,870
I'm not sure who's used uber cart is

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,510
that may be familiar to a lot of us and

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,950
then who's used commerce in the room

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,039
okay so a few more views commerce the

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,889
noob regret which is cool yeah

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,050
something got better hopefully but the

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,270
challenge is when you develop a big

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,099
project on Drupal like that as you're

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,379
developing each new field in each new

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,969
entity type there there are new modules

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,610
released in the Drupal community that

00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:57,680
like improve upon what you've been doing

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,509
and so each successive field that you

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,039
ride in each successive entity type that

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,020
you define gets a little bit more

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,699
complete but you still have all this old

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,650
code that you have to carry around with

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,500
you like a weight tied to your foot and

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,940
so each of our reference fields for

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,520
example in commerce one that X are

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,960
implemented differently until we finally

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
arrived at the entity reference field

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,159
but by that time we already had commerce

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,050
1 dot x released so we didn't have that

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,669
to take advantage of but on commerce 2x

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,460
will be able to get rid of about three

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,319
thousand lines of inconsistent code and

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,180
just use the core entity reference field

00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,949
module instead which is a huge win for

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,080
us additionally we are maybe mapping out

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,129
more entity types and we've had before

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,289
but but part of that is because we it's

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,699
just easier like the entity API in

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,139
Drupal 8 is more robust and more

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,210
complete than what we have in Drupal 7

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,800
but we also realize that there are more

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,430
things that are inherent to e-commerce

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,680
than we provided for or a lab form

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,089
commerce 1 dot x so so one example is in

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,740
the bottom right-hand here you can see

00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:00,050
that we've separated out a payment

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,819
transaction from a payment allocation

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,029
and a lot of people think well that's

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,039
stupid that's just needless you know

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,599
abstraction but the real challenge comes

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,400
in whenever you have a payment and you

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,770
need to refund part of that payment

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,289
because you know some of it went toward

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,029
this this line item some of it went

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,529
towards shipping and this much was taxed

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,479
well I need to know whenever I come to

00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,279
process a refund is the part that I'm

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,169
refunding was that text or was that just

00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,060
some digital product that wasn't tax

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,009
there's a lot of things that that's

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,479
separating out like the actual payment

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,099
transaction with the gateway from how it

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,529
was allocated on an order will make a

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,779
significant difference to other things

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,510
include no longer separating out

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,029
products from product displays which is

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,289
one of the sort of key steps or

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,480
differences that we made been coming to

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,800
commerce from uber card was the idea

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,020
that all of your products queues are

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,949
defined independently and sort of exists

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,050
in their own table and then they're

00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:53,089
referenced by other pieces of content

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,100
website to create what we call a product

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,779
display which looks like an Add to Cart

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,370
form that may or may not have options

00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,870
that you're selecting and we had a lot

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,279
of good reasons for separating things

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,990
out but we realized that a lot of those

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,570
good reasons have sort of evaporated now

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,680
with innovations in Drupal 8 itself so

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,660
we'll go back to products themselves

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,670
being displayable entities that may or

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,560
may not have children that determine

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,290
things like the size of a t-shirt that

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,089
you're selecting from a group but that's

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,589
two of the two of the biggest changes

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,060
that will have in the entity

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,040
relationship model around products and

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,180
also around some other things will be

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,680
coming down the pipe like having an

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,110
actual store entity where you define

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,750
your store global level configuration or

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,459
to facilitate marketplaces and that kind

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,019
of thing so those are things that are

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,399
going to change the interview

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,740
relationship model will tease those out

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,500
of her time but honestly we really don't

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,050
owe commerce to that x development by

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,480
focusing on the library's first and on

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,709
some of that consensus building first so

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,649
the first one that we put up was the

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,390
Commerce guys / int L library which is

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,450
just an internationalization library

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,890
that's focusing on currency formatting

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,709
and management and also locale

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,120
management so the idea here is that and

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,290
you may have seen boy yawns blog post on

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,270
the topic it's linked here it'll be

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,300
linked in the slides but the idea is

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:09,459
that the euro doesn't have a like a

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,360
format you know who here has like

00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,279
background in trying to just do like

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,500
multi you know international like

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,510
e-commerce in Europe few of us it did

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,250
you actually use one format for the euro

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,680
did you make it dependent on the country

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,240
so in the UK the sign might come before

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,399
and in France they'll come after and in

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,350
some places going to have a comma versus

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,180
a period and so on even though it's one

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,890
currency it actually has a wide variety

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,350
of ways for it to be displayed to the

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:36,890
end user and so this library actually

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,220
accommodates all of that for basically

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,360
every currency known to mankind except

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,890
for the ones that are no longer used we

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
have tried to call out some of the craft

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,810
from the the database but what's great

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,399
about this library is that because boyum

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,160
started here and did such a stellar job

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,500
producing it it is now influencing the

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,740
direction of symphony itself so symphony

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,810
2 dot 6 is going to have our JSON source

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,220
files or data files here and use some of

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,100
the concepts that we have implemented

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,649
for locale and currency selection and

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,170
then simply

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,300
two dot seven should actually have this

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,040
code in it so we don't even have to have

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,079
this as a dependency so that's obviously

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,660
not set in stone and if Fabien here he

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,279
might take issue but the idea is that

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,930
that symphony is generally moving in the

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,730
direction of the implementation we have

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,230
here for currency and number formatting

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,790
which would be a huge win for us

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,790
obviously one less thing for us to

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,649
depend on and manage and maintain once

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,300
you have currency formatting and

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,889
currency handling the next thing you

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,740
have to care about is how to actually

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,660
build and manipulate a price because of

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,309
course if you're talking about European

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,100
usage versus the u.s. you have different

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:43,529
types of taxes in sales tax versus v80

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,290
but even with vit rules you have

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,970
different you know orders in which they

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,829
might apply relative to certain types of

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,420
discounts obviously if you're doing

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,369
business to business and a mix of B to C

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,110
then you have different ways you have to

00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:58,740
apply your you vit and manage those

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,809
prices so this library is all about

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,910
instantiating a price object actually

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,949
having an API to manipulate the price

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,389
and then tracking the changes that you

00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:09,240
know as necessary relative to one

00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,009
another so that's probably the least

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,410
developed of the three the next one

00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,600
being the the second most developed is

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,949
the addressing library in boylan

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,829
recently blogged about this as well if

00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:21,749
you're interested as with currencies you

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,850
have locale specific address formatting

00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:24,959
and address requirements obviously for

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,240
different countries you have the

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,610
selection of provinces and states and

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,980
regions and the like and what we did in

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,809
this library is we're still using the

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,459
the xal the extensible address language

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,050
xml schema that we adopted for the

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,679
address field module and commerce one

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:46,740
but here we've actually taken Google's

00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,230
data set from the Android SDK to get all

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,059
of the address formats for every country

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,519
in the world including their locale

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,870
specific address formats and so one

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,839
example is just that if you have a

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,600
Chinese e-commerce site if you're

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,699
viewing this site in Chinese the order

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,589
of the address elements is reversed from

00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,679
if you are viewing this site in English

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,439
even if the the destination address were

00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,879
a Chinese address so they're real funny

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,399
requirements like that the google took

00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,009
who knows how much time to convince into

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,120
one giant data set that they've let us

00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,250
relicense

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,529
MIT license and packaged up in the JSON

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,660
files that we can then use both to build

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,700
a dress forms and to format addresses

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,230
for display and we also differentiate

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,029
between formatting and address for

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,490
display on the screen versus on a

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,080
printed label for example in the United

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,390
States so that the Postal Service's

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,740
machines can read the addresses for

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,150
automatic sorting you have to have

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,650
everything in all capital is you know

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,360
all capital letters whereas on this on

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,339
the the website you wouldn't do that so

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,750
a lot of things accommodated by the

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,480
addressing library it feels like we

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,730
finally have like an actual answer to

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,680
the mess of our own creation in the

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,510
address field module that you might

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,160
currently be using and all this sort of

00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,380
leads up to the point that we're doing

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,180
something right because it's attracted

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,310
attention not just within the Drupal

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,960
community but even beyond our borders so

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,910
we've often talked about getting off the

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,620
island in the Drupal community by taking

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,540
advantage of third-party libraries and

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,160
not maintaining everything in house but

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,810
we're not actually exporting as well so

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,310
we're not just importing new tools were

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,290
able to push our you know push our

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,020
solutions upstream and get folks you

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,120
know following along you know to put us

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,570
in a nice hot trending spot for one day

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,560
anyways because they like the solution

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,150
and they're they're looking to use them

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,640
in their own e-commerce applications

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,200
even outside of Drupal so if you want to

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,630
learn more about where to dot X is

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,740
headed or what's already been developed

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,500
voyance Ivanovic will be leading a buff

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,230
he's our TX lead developer that will be

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,130
tomorrow in the emerald lounge at 1045

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:46,020
am so that's Drupal commerce to you in a

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,600
nutshell and that's very cool Ryan

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,310
thanks very much but that's also for the

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,440
future right that's a commercial addicts

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,260
coming but there are already lots of

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,060
very interesting stuff on commerce 10

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,070
text triple commerce and can you tell

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,990
more about this yes i will look at Stan

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:08,970
thanks for that prompt we rehearse that

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,350
I should know weekend yeah okay um so

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,089
commerce one night x is also still

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,400
getting attention obviously we're

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,440
nearing fifty thousand sites which means

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,120
in probably just a few weeks we will

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,930
have more drupal commerce sites than

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,839
there are uber cart sites you know so

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,520
that's that's kind of I don't know who

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,800
you're played Mario Cart a lot on the

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,300
Super Nintendo

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,430
said you know you can always you could

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,320
race against your ghost I kind of feel

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,790
like I've been chasing that eager card

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,269
number ever since we released Commerce

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:41,269
we're almost there but that represents

00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,580
like huge attraction more than I ever

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,490
expected and you know what we're finding

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,230
is that you know every week somebody is

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,149
releasing a new module to integrate a

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,709
new payment system we're doing several

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,320
you might find them in our marketplace a

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,600
new fulfillment system a new niche

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,310
concern for Chinese e-commerce versus

00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,959
Russian e-commerce versus what I you

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,640
know whatever I think whatever Bitcoin

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,140
became big there was suddenly like six

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,810
different Bitcoin payment modules

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,310
available so we sort of reached the

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,860
tipping point where people use Commerce

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,100
says they're sort of de facto solution

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,450
for e-commerce on Drupal 7 and we

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,540
continue to integrate new service

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:21,290
providers and try to you know flesh out

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,470
the weak systems where need be but

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,870
there's still more to do I think the

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,850
most the most pressing changes revolve

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,890
around digital e-commerce in the EU

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,709
you're going to have changes to how you

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,750
have to charge tax I believe it's its

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,149
country of destination taxing for

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,440
digital products versus source country

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,680
and I'm not sure how it all works out

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,170
but the idea is that these modules will

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,290
continue to provide full euv IT support

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,760
even with the upcoming changes and these

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,980
are these are maintained by David

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,209
kitchen out of our office in the UK and

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,550
then we also have a couple of tax

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:58,579
services integrated exact or in Avalara

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,010
and i'm not sure if Avalara manages v80

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:03,050
in the EU but I know exact where does so

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,579
we continue to focus on you know making

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,410
sure that you can sell anything to

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,689
anyone anywhere including every country

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,000
in the EU through both via T support and

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,250
multi-currency support but what has me

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,679
most excited and I call it my vertical

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,530
to watch is digital commerce and I was

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,209
anybody here at drupalcon Austin a few

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,650
did you catch the digital commerce

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,630
ecosystem presentation made a chance now

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,429
Boyan and david kitchen were there and

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,320
they you know it's recorded here for you

00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,360
to go in view but it basically walks

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,000
through the entire suite of modules that

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,280
we've developed to power the the billing

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,710
and subscription management behind

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,049
platform and behind our marketplace so

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,350
what you have in the whole did

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,299
commerce ecosystem now for Drupal is the

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,129
full capability to license digital

00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:52,869
assets whether that's membership on a

00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:56,080
website or access to a file or ownership

00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:58,059
of a platform you can then tie that to

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,799
some sort of card on file payment method

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,720
obviously managed through a payment

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,820
gateway and then you have license

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,269
billing which supports both metered

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,059
usage and just monthly monthly billing

00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,100
or recurring billing and you then have

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,690
Dunning management modules to close the

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,820
loop on making sure that expired credit

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,830
cards get notified and people continue

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,299
to pay their bills on time so that whole

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,429
suite of modules existed I feel like

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:25,090
there was something I'm missing in there

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:28,029
as well it slips my mind what's that

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,399
invoice yeah I invoicing it is yeah I

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:33,039
can't remember not important but but the

00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,480
big idea is that I see right now drupal

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,440
commerce actually provides one of the

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,840
most robust digital commerce offerings

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,580
on the market I know that some of the

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,039
big names or digital river and other

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,590
other big digital commerce specific

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,330
applications but but in what we have

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,970
here both with Drupal has the sort of

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,840
base both to build communities and to

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,309
manage you know manage private files and

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,659
divvy on access based on any number of

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,100
parameters we have sort of the

00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:02,499
foundation that we need to then just add

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,200
commerce to it to really create any kind

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:07,419
of digital commerce site imaginable and

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,789
so we're some of our biggest client

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,350
successes lately have been from whether

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,460
it you know ticketing or subscription

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,679
management or you know digital streaming

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,480
video services or whatever it anyways I

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,799
see this as a vertical to watch and a

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,710
something that I'm most interested in

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,330
selling today is finding more digital

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,090
commerce opportunities for us to take on

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,059
and continue to test and build out the

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,190
ecosystem of models around it so what's

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:35,940
next for us is a virtual sprint after

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,559
drupalcon Amsterdam where we'll focus on

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Drupal Commerce one dot 11 release some

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,149
of us may have seen the security release

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,710
recently for commerce 110 there's more

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:46,029
that we hoped to do before we had to put

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,669
that release out but we also wanted to

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,200
get the user name bug fixed so we'll do

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,450
that sprint after Amsterdam if anybody

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,710
would like to join us virtually there is

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,600
a thread on Drupal

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,250
org that I can't remember the title of

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,620
that sort of organizing this whole thing

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,899
we're also looking to make significant

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,490
merchant usability improvements soham

00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:05,919
partnership with I costs we've developed

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,890
a new back end that's much more rational

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,630
for a non technical merchant to manage

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,950
returns and do customer service on

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,419
orders and I kind of think last report i

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,490
got indicated that might have been a bit

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,630
tightly coupled to their requirements so

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,690
we may have to do some abstraction

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,980
before that's totally publishable up on

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,990
drupal.org but i expect that to happen

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,870
soon and then finally i'm also

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,299
personally committed to refocusing our

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,460
efforts on marketing and reporting tools

00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,190
once upon a time we integrated with

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,870
giraffe that provided a full ecommerce

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,299
analytics dashboard out of the box in

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,770
the back end of your commerce site then

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,559
once upon a time they stopped supporting

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,179
Drupal commerce I can't really what it

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,460
was it was a refocusing on their part on

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,140
other e-commerce platforms at the same

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,120
time that they rebuild their API so

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,130
suddenly we were left without anything

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,799
except a views powered reporting

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,409
dashboard so I'm you know in talks with

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,899
keen eye Oh which is kind of my favorite

00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:03,970
service at the moment for taking

00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:05,740
reporting out of the drupal database and

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,990
then still having nice fancy

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,539
visualizations in widgets for the the

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,370
store merchant and marketer to use to

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,890
track the pot you know that the success

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,049
of their stores so looking for those

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,820
things to happen probably over the next

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,710
six months although the usability

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,450
improvements to the backend should land

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,250
sooner if you have any questions about

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,350
this feel free to find me afterwards and

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,299
I'd love to get you plugged in to help

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,070
making these things more robust so

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,779
without further ado I'll hand the mic

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,820
over to August an to talk about the

00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:36,669
exciting developments in platform that

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,980
Sh Thank You Ryan don't take your mic so

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:42,549
I can heckle I can't do the reverse ring

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,440
yeah hi guys sorry for my accent I'm

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,970
French so I need to still work on that

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,580
could you repeat that I couldn't

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,929
understand okay so I'll try to do today

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,760
better thanks Ryan and we did Roberta um

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:59,529
so any of you guys have heard about

00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:01,240
platform sh okay that's small amount we

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:03,610
have work today okay

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,420
I mean a lot of work so i will wear

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,280
switched the station and okay so to just

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,260
summarize what's platform platform is

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,730
the new development and hosting solution

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,250
that we've been at commerce guys we've

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,530
been doing that for our first unused

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,120
case and then we have decided to market

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,420
that as a product and deliver that for

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,670
anyone to a build drupal project and now

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,260
all sort of PHP project it's not only

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,610
specific to drop all you can be linney

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,090
symphonia application and your work

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:32,620
precipitation any PHP kristin PHP

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,740
basically the whole idea is that each

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,660
each git branch gets its own URL so each

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,340
time you create a branch platform will

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,110
deploy a complete new environment for

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,520
you where you can test test your feature

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,190
that you're implementing on that branch

00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,470
and have a complete like live

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,570
environment which will implement that

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,720
feature so that's the main idea I really

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:56,380
encourage you to go to both our booth to

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,450
get a demo and just just like see how

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,670
how it works because I'm not going to

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,090
just go very deep into the details of

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,890
platform I'm going to talk about one

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,850
website that we launched on platform

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,410
enterprise which is flexible de which

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,180
has been implemented by von der crowd

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,470
which is our platform partner so they

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,750
have decided to move all of their

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,160
development into platform message for

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,160
all of their projects were very proud of

00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,310
that and we they have recently launched

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,050
a flexible study which is a very big

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,500
website for ticketing systems one of the

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:33,670
ten most tailing system in Europe they

00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,830
sell like loans distance buses and why

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,720
does it matter why are we talking now

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,930
about that project because this this is

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,310
really a big project this is their their

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,530
website is where they make business

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,140
that's where they sell their products

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,990
the website just can never go down right

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,240
they have to have a very very high

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,390
availability and how do we fix that why

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,580
do how how why did this choose platform

00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,410
for that why why is it so important for

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,600
them to have platform that's because our

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,240
architecture in platform implements a

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,090
stripper we don't see we don't don't see

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,240
architecture sorry so we have three each

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,340
each environment has is deploying into

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,410
three different data centers okay we're

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,780
using amaz

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,390
edible us to deploy your website and

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,390
each of the project is hosting in three

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,210
different instances so we we can just

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,130
kill one oast and like take down 10

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,750
store to host and your website we still

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,880
be running okay that's very important

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,530
for them and what's even more important

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,420
is that their website has lots of

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,580
fluctuations over there you're right if

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,550
it's the during vacation times they are

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,530
going to have lots and lots of of cells

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,750
and then they want to be able to scale

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,400
very easily without any downtime they

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,510
don't they cannot have any downtime and

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,550
what we do is with platform we can have

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:53,130
zero downtime scalability also recently

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:55,500
but also more importantly vertically so

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,870
we can just make a host grow over time

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,570
without any downtime by just taking down

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,860
one host rebooting it later and the

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,340
other hosts are going to take care of

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,310
the the traffic of the website and we

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,600
also provide like since security is

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,100
really important for e-commerce any

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,540
commercial website will provide 100

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:18,330
person ssl security and we use cloud

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,040
font for the CDN so we use platform to

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,510
to really do the caching of all the

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,330
assets that are served on the website

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,250
and the main thing of a platform is that

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,620
it really helps to keep things organized

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,300
because platforms allows you to have a

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,490
lot of different development environment

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,500
each branch is an environment so that

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,420
you can work with as many environment as

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,430
you want in the workflow that you want

00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,680
so if you look at the platform you I it

00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,330
allows you to have lots of environment

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,950
and you can give each of the

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,530
environments to one specific developer

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,930
or you can give it to a client to test

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,330
on that you can give it to a specific

00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,670
font and integrator and just start

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,350
another element directly for him where

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,240
you can just test it stuff and then you

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,740
merge back to the live environment and

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,600
you do you manage all your deployment

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,090
directly into the platform SH

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,910
interfacing so that's really that's

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,950
really something powerful that all the

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,060
other providers don't don't provide like

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,890
all those environments where you can

00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,290
just test your stuff in the live

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,760
conditions the idea there is that an

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,800
environment then you sort becomes a

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,020
cheap resource it's it's meant to be

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,420
spun up used and then once it's serve

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,130
its purpose you know thrown away so on a

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,380
project that I have

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,630
in in Greenville it's just me and

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,550
another developer obviously we want to

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,100
continue to develop you know in parallel

00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,200
to one another so we have our master

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,970
environment that then had a sprint

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,070
specific environment beneath it and

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,810
because it maintains the hierarchy for

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,150
the purposes of synchronizing commits up

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,820
and data down we then beneath the Sprint

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,960
environment have one each development

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,820
environment for myself in the other

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,290
individual I'm working with and then

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,760
we're able to synchronize things in our

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,500
you know sprint branch and then merge

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,580
everything back up to master and then at

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,530
the end of the sprint just delete those

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,880
environments and start afresh and then

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,650
what's what's great about having access

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,940
controlled environments is that if we

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,190
needed to use somebody else so that's

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,560
that we had to outsource part of the

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,570
development to some consultant or

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,860
freelancer and we could create an

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,780
environment that was the only

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,450
environment that user can access in our

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,670
platform so they couldn't then control

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,750
the deployment of new features or you

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,030
know mess up anything else we have going

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,830
on at all so I we found that to be

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,290
particularly useful as an end user of

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,910
the project so exactly especially if you

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,200
specifically for a big project where you

00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,060
have lots of people working on the

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,530
project and not all of them are working

00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,480
at the same time so you just want to be

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,860
able to create prod create environment

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,990
really easily and destroy the

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:38,700
environment once the user has been done

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,900
working on that feature and if you have

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,610
really if you have any question about

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,050
platform please come at our booth will

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,930
have lots of sessions lots of

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,120
demonstration about the platform and I

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,920
think it's really interesting but why

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,710
are we again talking about platform and

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,930
why I did Ryan mention the the digital

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,190
commerce stuff that's because acquiring

00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,020
customers when you're doing the

00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,520
recurring business like sending platform

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,610
subscription or saying trainings or

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,950
sending events that's really hard like

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,780
recurring subscriptions occurring

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,220
customers for recurring subscription is

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,500
really hard and you have couple of

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,020
models to fix that one of them is the

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,910
freemium ok you can give part of your

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,930
project like part of your product for

00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,220
free to your customers but since each of

00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,690
the new environments on the platform

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,000
case for example each of the

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,530
environments costs money we we cannot

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,690
really afford that we're going to lose a

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,360
lot of money just by doing freemium

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,610
because we cannot just reduce the the

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,130
product to something that we can gift

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,020
for free right so we've decided to

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,870
implement the vouchers what

00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,030
we called vouchers which is a time-based

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,590
subscription for free that people can

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,300
use your product and that people can

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,130
just say whether they want they like it

00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,690
or not and then after a while they are

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,800
going to start paying for that and

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:54,660
that's actually that's been like

00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,640
proposed to drupal commerce drugs so you

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,080
can find the voucher module into Drupal

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,090
commerce drug and implement that on your

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,190
on your own website if you are doing any

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,020
recurring recurring business and that's

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,610
very effective I mean google ad works

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,490
for example has been using that and they

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,410
were giving like 100 run red dollar for

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,360
free to any new subscription for their

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,310
product and that we are now or using

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,890
their product so that's very effective

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,050
and that's also load the load your sales

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,480
team to do their own job right they can

00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,640
create vouchers on your on your on your

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,370
website they can give it up give that to

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,730
your customers and they can track the

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,110
revenue of your like any campaign that

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,060
they want to create they can just track

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,000
what's been happening when it's been a

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,770
happening they can improve the voucher

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,300
they can really play with your product

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,710
so I'm not there yeah that's that's very

00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,170
important and that's really being built

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,390
by commerce guys and deployed on Drupal

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:52,980
commerce so feel free to use it and feel

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:54,510
free to report it and yeah we have lots

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,300
of vouchers for platform and we're going

00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,920
to give that to you so just come at the

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,570
end of the session and asked me for a

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,740
voucher and I'll give you a voucher for

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:11,640
trying platform I think I'm good and

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,900
then I give the mic to Ryan okay alright

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,030
so that's most of what's going on in

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,530
commerce guys these days if there any

00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,700
questions we can entertain him for a few

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,960
minutes otherwise if you'd like to know

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,030
more you can come join us at the booth

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,740
or the Commerce village where you can

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,260
find a variety of our technical partners

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,620
there to talk about their payment and

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,190
email and fulfillment solutions so I had

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,190
one in the corner

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,559
yeah the question is is is comma or is

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,450
platform desay specifically told up for

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:54,179
commerce or is it you know generally

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:57,059
yeah yeah it's no it's not I mean yeah

00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:59,340
it's not specific to commerce maybe the

00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,840
only the only differentiating thing

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,250
would be that you get an ssl certificate

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,370
for free on any level of platform

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,950
subscription I think last I checked it

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,809
was like SSL started at a hundred

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,490
dollars a month on Pantheon i'm not sure

00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,899
what it is on ah quee a-- but then

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,360
that's that's kind of a minor thing the

00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,620
underlying architecture is much like

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,600
what you would use for any drupal

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,340
website so the full stack of you know

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,529
engine X php5 dot three maybe four php5

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,559
got something my sequel read is solar

00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:30,570
etc it's all pretty pretty similar you

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,220
know grid of services so yeah basically

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,960
platform is not specific to Drupal

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,250
commerce but it's more in a sense

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,870
specific to Drupal because we are

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,309
leveraging all the best practices that

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,019
we have in report for example you can

00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,669
just push on Exile and platform will

00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,010
build your project for you without

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,380
needed to just pull all the Drupal push

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,730
all the Drupal fights so basically it

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,289
that's really easy to maintain your

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,850
modules because you can just edit your

00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,529
mag file and we push something and your

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,330
deployments your environments are going

00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:56,549
to get deployed with those new versions

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,380
so you get your repository very clean

00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:59,850
and since we support also Symphony

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,169
applications we do that exactly the same

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:06,620
way with a composer touches on files

00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,620
yeah another one

00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,320
yeah so the question is how long does it

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,510
take to build an environment once you've

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,440
created the branch so the current

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,510
response is a bit less than 30 second

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,920
and we are still not happy about that

00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,180
because surge a second makes the

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,430
difference between something that is

00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,410
instant or something that is like very

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,660
short and we want the instant version

00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,000
it's really improving me to start a gif

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,100
image I mean yeah its 32nd like you can

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,230
if you're waiting searches ones for your

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,360
new environment to Bill you can just

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,710
switch page and go to facebook.com or

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,870
something like that so we really want to

00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:00,300
improve that and make sure it's going to

00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:02,130
be instance no they are not there we are

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,380
we're doing like a snapshot of all the

00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,660
containers running at the other like the

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,160
the instance leather so we're not doing

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,020
an export of the database we don't have

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,460
any downtime and on the website we're

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,700
really doing a snapshot than using that

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,700
snapshot

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,070
yeah that that doesn't really depend on

00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,370
the size of the website because it's

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:36,020
like it's really a snapshot so so yeah a

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:37,220
bit less than 30 seconds for now yeah so

00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,460
that's a good question we're going like

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,920
deep into the plateau the question is

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,990
about synchronizing databases and yet

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,480
directly directly from the platform Shu

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,830
I you can get you have a yorkie between

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,840
the environments so when you create an

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,880
environment the environment knows about

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,430
its parent so if you create if you clone

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,610
the live environments you create a child

00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,170
of the the live environment and you can

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,610
synchronize the database from the live

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,410
environment into the parent the child

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,610
environment and then again that child on

00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,830
very much you can branch it again and

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,810
synchronize data base and once you do

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,060
the synchronization of the database you

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,480
can also run sanitization scripts using

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,710
rush and those configurations are

00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,450
including to your git repository which

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,730
means that directly from the UI when you

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,530
branch an environment or your since you

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,210
synchronize a database you can run

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,760
sanitization so all your development

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,460
environments will note we will not get

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,389
any live data like user passwords or

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,389
user image sore

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,520
okay the CLI the command line interface

00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:45,570
that we've provided which is available

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,179
on github litter get com is an extension

00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:50,730
of the platform platform provides an API

00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,700
and the UI that you saw on the screen

00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:55,169
shot uses that API but the CLI also uses

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,940
that API so everything that is available

00:34:55,169 --> 00:35:00,240
on the UI will be available in city and

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,150
CLI and the CLI offers like like it

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,920
helps you to kick start your project

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,720
like and branch you can synchronize you

00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,430
can destroy environments but that's not

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,990
an extension to dress you still need you

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:21,330
still use George the same way that you

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:23,360
were using drugs before so that's a good

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,040
question for now platform is a few don't

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,630
provide a way of just doing your local

00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,940
environment because we think that the

00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,580
best practice is really to have as many

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,470
development environment live on platform

00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,000
which can still use the CLI to build

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,130
your website locally that means that if

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,870
you run the platform built comment from

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,590
the cell I it's going to build your

00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:45,090
files on your local server and it

00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,500
they're going to get deployed the same

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,050
way as they would if they were on

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,660
platform except that you can like you

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:54,360
can use Josh to like synchronize your

00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,890
database and get the units solar for

00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:02,310
example you need to set the set that up

00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:03,600
yourself sure yeah and platform provides

00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,670
you the alias is automatically so you

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,430
just when you get to branch also get the

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,410
aliases directly so that's handy really

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,440
I encourage you to go to our boots and

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:18,060
learn more about platform August and as

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,970
good demos any other questions about

00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,990
what's going on with Commerce guys or

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,990
trooper commerce yeah

00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:33,870
is it possible to host it on what yeah

00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,640
yeah the question is is it possible to

00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,410
host it only in European data centers

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,840
and the answer is yes we actually

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:43,980
started we're not using Ireland for both

00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,530
us and europe yeah server which is yes

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,620
right yeah okay I'm not done here right

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,380
okay so yes yeah but you are using two

00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,050
different amazon datacenters one in the

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,890
US and one of the EU and the roadmap for

00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,810
platform is to not only be able to be to

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,300
get deployed non-edible us so we also

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,740
want to be able to give you platform and

00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,680
that you can deploy on your own data

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,660
center a raspberry pi or raspberry pi if

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,080
you have a powerful rather if Iran and

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,520
then you do right alright well we'll tie

00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,260
it off there if you have any further

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,790
questions about platform feel free to

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,930
come harass August an and if you have

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,060
any about Drupal commerce feel free to

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:28,140
harass me and I will see you the rest of

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:30,060
the car thank you very much guys and yet

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,340
come to me to get a voucher if you want

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,340
