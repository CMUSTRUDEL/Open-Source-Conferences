Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Sell Anything to Anyone, Anywhere (Commerce Without Borders)
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: rszramaGuGuss
For the last five years Commerce Guys has pursued its vision to develop the leading open source eCommerce framework on Drupal. As our footprint grew internationally, our understanding of such a framework likewise grew to include the tools and systems required to sell anything to anyone anywhere. Recent developments in the Drupal Commerce 1.x contributed module ecosystem and in Drupal Commerce 2.x itself highlight just how far weâ€™ve come in providing global support for currencies, price formatting, addressing, and more.

As of this Summer, with the launch of Platform.sh to the general public, we now also provide development teams with the tools they need to launch their projects even faster. Additionally, the tools we developed to drive our recurring billing and voucher systems are now available to power your next digital commerce project!

In this session, Ryan and Augustin will showcase these latest developments at Commerce Guys with a special focus on the business value they bring to our partners and customers.
