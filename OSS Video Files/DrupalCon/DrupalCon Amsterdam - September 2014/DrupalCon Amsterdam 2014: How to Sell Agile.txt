Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: How to Sell Agile
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: wesku
Agile is not a new thing, everybody and their mom has heard about agile projects. Most people also know about the business benefits of agile. Agile practises are spreading like wildfire in the corporate world, companies are discovering considerable business benefits from agile adoption. At the same time too many Drupal companies are making excuses for why waterfall or fake agile *LINK* is the way to go simply because they have failed to sell or adopt agile.

Wunderkraut was born agile. We've never done anything else and we do exclusively agile projects. At the same time most of our new customers are not all that familiar with agile. Selling agile for non-agile customers is an art form that very few people master. After doing it for living for longer than Wunderkraut has existed I'm ready to make the bold claim of being an expert on the topic.

My goal for this session
To help Drupal vendors move to agile, for real this time. As the CEO of Wunderkraut and a director for the Drupal Association I do my best to help Drupal grow. Personally I see improving the business of all Drupal vendors as a very good way to do this.

What will you get from attending
You'll hear some of the not-so-well guarded business secrets of the largest Drupal services provider in Europe. Just don't expect to get a silver bullet from this session, this stuff is really hard. The session will however provide you with a starting point and a direction for becoming really efficient on selling agile.

Caution: This is the very first time I'm presenting this session. As for anything software related, the initial launch is likely to have some bugs in it. Consider yourself warned, if you attend you'll be a beta tester for this session.

twitter to take your questions because

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,660
it otherwise it may be impossible so

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,420
i'll get you on hashtag selling agile

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,370
and we'll start getting some questions

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,519
in very soon but let's get started with

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,959
the show by how do vendor sell our job

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:57,049
this is Beth to Taliban he's a CMS and

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,849
CMS expert liar if you will so what he

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,620
does for living is right are of peace

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,989
for different companies choose these

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,049
vendors runs the RFP process and so on

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,450
so his views on unlike how do you choose

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,769
vendors I think are quite valuable so

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,049
let's see if I get the video thing

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:17,510
working I think selling natural is a

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:21,590
really actually dangerous style of

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,739
selling the projects we see a lot like

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,200
too much and I think many agencies

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,959
should more focus to the benefits what

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,660
the agile method offers for the clients

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,390
in many situations when I'm on client

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,060
side I see that the when the client says

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,430
they won't actually I'll project what

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,069
they actually want they want just

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,069
visibility for the project and they want

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,620
a really structured and easy change

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,090
control mechanism and that's the two

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,489
things what the clients are actually

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,950
expecting and that's what the agencies

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,230
should convince the client that they

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,750
have this kind of visibility visible

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,690
process and lot of change control

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:07,250
possibilities our channel should be a

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,440
secondary thing in their speech to

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,880
repeat the key message because I don't

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,829
think we can cramp up crank up the

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,600
volume more and unless we get somebody

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,600
from the technical stuff here so

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,940
basically he said don't sell agile at

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,530
all sell the benefits of a job which i

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,030
think is right on the money that's what

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,150
you really should do and that's one of

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,250
the key focus poison here so treat

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,470
really for today first of all at

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,250
charlies as such it's not difficult to

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,380
sell everybody wants to buy agile but it

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,210
is still difficult to sell real agile so

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,630
that's going to be the first topic then

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,949
I have a couple of case studies

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,600
situations that you will run into when

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,340
you're trying to sell agile projects to

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,370
your customers stuff that happens in

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,770
real life and I'll exim in a bit like

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,530
each one of them like how to deal with

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,449
these situations and in the end it's not

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,910
always appropriate to sell at all and

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,070
there's not only like one way of selling

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,870
at sell one flavor of a jolly few well

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:08,360
so I'll cover that as just a bit as well

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,400
so first of all I would like to hear

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,979
from the audience so now it's now it's

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,539
okay to twiddle all of these things I

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,270
would like to hear like how large

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:19,460
percentage of of your projects are agile

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,849
or what you would consider agile so if

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,710
you could tweet this and use the hashtag

00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,630
selling agile we will get some

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,470
statistics by the end of the session and

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:33,169
this so please to tweet it also the same

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,389
hashtag selling agile we will use for

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,690
all the questions so if you have any

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,820
question feel free to tweet it and heck

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,070
you will will choose some of the the

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,449
most interesting ones and bring them up

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:50,419
to my attention so first of all why is

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:53,240
agile like real at all difficult to sell

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,820
well really it really comes down to

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,680
trust it's really lack of trust that is

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,840
like built into the relationship between

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,940
customer and vendor like way too often

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,130
the customer thinks you are there to

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,960
steal their money the vendor thinks that

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,330
the customer is just trying to get free

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,840
work in the end so that's that that's

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,419
the core core thing but still you know I

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,970
haven't really had any real problem

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:20,060
selling Angela such and I had a

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,310
discussion around this topic in a global

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,440
scrum gathering a week ago with with a

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,630
room full of people like is selling out

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,370
y'all difficult how you do it everybody

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,320
was saying like well it used to be

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,599
difficult like five years ago or even

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,240
ten years ago these days it's it's

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,700
really not all that difficult it's just

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,960
the problem of like yeah they would love

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,710
to do agile but they really don't

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,270
understand

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,470
they don't understand the benefits and

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,230
they don't understand what it actually

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,820
requires that's what I'm going to start

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,640
by talking just a bit about this topic

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,200
because i personally run into this all

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,480
the time we do quite a bit of agile

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,010
training and aunt are coaching and we do

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,800
see the issue of like people really

00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:01,190
really don't understand what it means so

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,230
to set the set the basic seen on this

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,920
first of all agile is not about software

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:09,590
at all you happen to do software with

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,750
agile but the real change in agile is

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,330
not about software such it's not

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,700
implementation or Sprint's or all time

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,460
and materials it's it's really none of

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,280
these it's it's really a different way

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,040
of approaching how do we do cooperation

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,770
between organizations and how do how do

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,380
we do product development as such so

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,560
that's the first misconception if you

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,180
consider your projects like web projects

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,080
if you consider they're only like IT

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,240
projects and nothing else fine you

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,760
really can't can't go all that agile

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,430
because agile means quite heavy business

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,380
involvement in any sort of project so

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,590
the business owner who owns the project

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,190
they have to be involved if they're not

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:57,020
you can forget about it so what we say

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,530
all the ways is agile is simple but it's

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,740
not easy so any organization starting to

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,950
adapt agile you can do it you can learn

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,240
it in a couple of days quite easily

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,570
adopting it really and using it that

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,490
takes years years of practice so you're

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,340
sort of like getting the hang of it

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,080
after a year or two and then you really

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,240
start seeing more and more benefits when

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,090
you when you start adopting it and to

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,530
make the situation a bit more difficult

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,020
we as vendors we are working with

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:30,170
customers who don't understand agile so

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,000
another half of your agile like entity

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,850
changes all the time and when your

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,270
customers are different so let's look at

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:41,820
the basics I think who of you has not

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,320
seen this ever

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,480
I should have asked the other way around

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,720
who has seen it than you know but oh

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,370
well so this is the manifest afford just

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,930
off to a development bits all of we know

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,090
and love and all that then you know it

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,930
sounds great doesn't it and then there's

00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,750
the button and the real core of the

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:05,160
problem is actually here this is what

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,620
happens it's it's not proper agile it's

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,950
it's the half-assed version of agile so

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,540
basically to give you an example from

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,460
here oui oui of course it's better to

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,310
have customer collaboration than

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,250
conjured negotiation as long as you have

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,780
tricked contractors place so so you sort

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,000
of get all of these comments from the

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,370
customers often say like yeah sure we

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,350
can do sprints but it has to be fixed

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,690
everything we have to have a fixed scope

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,680
and we have to be very strict on what to

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,690
do so they kind of adopted gel but they

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,850
really don't because they break it in

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,100
process by doing a half-assed job on

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,220
doing it and this is this is what I see

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,820
very very often with the customers they

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,030
kind of love it but not really so this

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,920
is what what I call fake ad job and to

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,450
get a bit more examples on this again

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,020
I'm asking a bit of your your

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,260
participation first of all so to get the

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,210
rest of the session more fitting to to

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,760
your questions what's stopping you from

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,560
selling agile today why don't you know

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,910
first of all why are you here because if

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,470
you are setting all that challenge I

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,540
don't have any problems I don't think

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,010
you would be here so if you can help me

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,870
out a bit and let me know like what's

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,490
stopping you from selling agile today

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,950
feel free to tweet it and we will get

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,590
back to these questions fairly soon and

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,450
we'll also do a very nice pie chart on

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,200
like what are the biggest problems so

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:34,320
please help me out of it so I want to

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,900
bring in another angle to this topic so

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,670
I'm going to ask dick to to help us a

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,890
bit unlike from your point of view

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:47,420
what's stopping us from doing a job it's

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:49,830
it is a difficult question I think

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,550
you're touching on many good points here

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:57,170
and it's

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,170
people they think that they know agile

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,760
but they have difficulty seeing the

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,279
benefits of it and that's really because

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,500
many people they sell agile the wrong

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,940
way to companies like Pfizer I am in

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,190
touch with a lot of vendors that

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,589
approach us and they sell agile the

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,070
wrong way they they don't lift up the

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:22,800
benefits of agile they say we do sprints

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:26,040
reduce we standing up when we have our

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,089
meetings and it instead of sitting down

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:34,260
and these kind of things they don't sell

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:36,120
the benefits they don't sell the

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,070
benefits of doing product development

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,720
with agile and you know how you can how

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,839
you can test and measure your progress

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,329
and continuously improve and these kind

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,890
of things it's not about sprints as you

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:54,810
touched on and it's not about standing

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:57,420
up instead of sitting down so it really

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,600
selling it the wrong way that's you edgy

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,029
educating organizations like Pfizer the

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,430
wrong way it's I think that's the simple

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,120
answer to quite a complex question

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,490
really yeah and i think that's that's

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,380
exactly what it is about and let's have

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,450
another view that I I think problems can

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,760
reinforce this you need to be really

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,100
quiet for four in order to hear this but

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,220
I hope you can be anyone here the

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,430
previous video still okay fine so let's

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,070
let's try if this one watching listen I

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,040
think the single biggest problem is

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,699
related to decision-making structure of

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,610
large organizations so they have pretty

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:41,970
slow decision-making processes and they

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,940
are not used to having these projects

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,890
which do constant demands to other

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,170
organs to other parts of the

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,230
organization and that's the biggest

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,110
single problem the current leadership

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:59,750
style a decision making

00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:02,149
process in Loris organizations so

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,240
basically basically the way they run

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,760
their business which is not very agile

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,410
and again this we see as a vendor over

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,329
and over again everything has to be

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,420
pre-approved which makes it pretty

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:16,190
difficult to be really a child so let's

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,390
move on to some real life examples in

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:22,160
case studies on this so the first one

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,769
sure we can do that job as long as you

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,660
deliver the entire scope and everything

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:29,300
within the budget and timeline and

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,709
nothing changes how many times have you

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,970
seen it who's seen this in an RFP there

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,899
are some people who haven't I'm

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:41,690
surprised so so this is this is the

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:45,320
typical argument you get and this

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:48,980
happens really quite often so how to

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,990
deal with it first of all in order to

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,660
sell any of these you should have a bit

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,670
of like storytelling skills so ideally

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,800
you should try to know something about

00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,959
the customer business and you should

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,089
tell them a story they can relate to

00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,160
like why did you fail on a previous

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,930
project you don't have to know the facts

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,630
it's quite easy to guess based on they

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,610
are of peace often it's like well let's

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,459
imagine you have this kind of project in

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,380
your business and then you do this and

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,449
you know what happens and then the end

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,250
result is kind of poor isn't it and then

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,079
you have them like a yeah yeah that's

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,000
just what happened that's what happened

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,640
the previous time so that's sort of the

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,920
foundation for it make stories out of

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,810
this stuff try to try to those stories

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,329
that are like specific for the customer

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,399
and their business and don't make them

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,199
about your business if you can I know

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,540
it's sometimes difficult if it's like if

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,000
the customers are company let's say

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,070
they're doing like cat food maybe it's

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,990
likely difficult to think about like you

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,510
know what's what's important for them

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,350
and what's their process like so that's

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,540
the first point second thing is like

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,079
approach it with some facts have a look

00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:00,290
at like why is so what's beneficial and

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,790
so on so for example in fixed bit or

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,100
agile you can have a look at like

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,680
different different things that are very

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,490
different in these and and I did this

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,310
for

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,680
real customer some time ago because they

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,420
were just like why should we do this a

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,690
child thing isn't it only time and

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,760
materials and so like no not really let

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,470
me you know get through all the points

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,899
it's like what's really different in

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,810
this so this couple of things here a

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,180
project focus of course the biggest

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,370
problem with fixed bit that the short

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,990
term I used to have fixed everything so

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,560
it's not only fixed price it's fixed

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,450
everything is it's like it's all about

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,580
checking boxes really so you have a

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,390
number of requirements for your project

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,070
and those boxes need to be checked and

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,709
who cares about the quality or anything

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,170
the vendor is motivated in trying to

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:53,720
check all the boxes with minimum amount

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,580
of effort because you make more profit

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,010
the faster you are more profit you make

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,589
basically so the incentives for the

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,020
vendor are not very healthy and and it's

00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:05,570
quite different from from when you're

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,550
doing agile because in a good way at

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,560
charlies time and materials so as a

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,529
customer you are paying for results and

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,779
and create quality can be one of them

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,420
and the vendor is not incentivized in

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,899
actually cutting quality or trying to

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,810
cut corners in just going somewhere so

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:27,500
it's very different change is pretty

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:30,320
evident what happens there and scope in

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,089
agile is actually improved it's not that

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,190
it's only a different scope it's

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:36,560
actually an improved scope because you

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,020
learn during a project so the final

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,290
scope ends up being better than the

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,870
original one you started with some more

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,240
stuff transparency is one of the key

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,250
reasons why are jolly so popular you

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,560
actually it's protest to become really

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,459
transparent when when you are doing that

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,890
job and in fixed bit if you're doing a

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,570
waterfall process what happens is this

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,579
thing is like ninety-five percent

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,890
complete but nobody knows what the

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,140
remaining five percent takes and and

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,660
that's that's the traditional problem

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,990
you have whereas in agile you you have a

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,970
real like tangible progress where stuff

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,569
that is actually ready to be be deployed

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,480
is delivered all the time so it's much

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,780
easier to track time to market this kind

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,850
of

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,020
evident because if you do all of the

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,720
design first before you start

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,460
implementing anything it is going to be

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,350
slower that way then delivering the

00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,010
highest value items first and starting

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,360
from their quality I think I touched on

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,200
that already so I'm just going to move

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,900
forward customer involvement also is

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,390
very different profile wise because you

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,280
couldn't really do an agile project

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,820
where the customer is on vacation all

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,570
the time so in more traditional way it's

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,600
like big push to do like a big piece of

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,780
documentation and then you know it's

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,580
easier in agile it's more like

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,610
distributed all over the project which

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,590
one do you prefer I don't know you get

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,740
better results anyway with with agile

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,370
approach in this case risks are a bit

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,020
different and pricing pricing is an

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,960
interesting thing because fixed bit is

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,510
anything but fixed because you have this

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,590
and this is a real picture so if you can

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:27,110
can treat them the small boat is

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:30,650
original original contract and the

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,570
bigger y of this change order and this I

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,880
think this is from some person from

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,520
construction industry that actually

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,070
holds the boats but this is true for the

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,460
IT industry as well that the IT vendors

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,010
are highly motivated on getting change

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,420
orders and their business depends on

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,370
getting as many chains orders as

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,910
possible because the profit margin is

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,830
way higher on James orders than in the

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,740
original contract and this is in your

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,290
traditional contract so so really the

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,120
fixed bit it's it's anything but in real

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,340
life it's it's just a good way for

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,320
vendors to lie to the customer and say

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,470
like yeah we'll do it for this money and

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,690
in the end everything ends up being a

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,940
change request so you know on the other

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,500
hand as a vendor if if you want to get a

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,650
bigger boat you may want to consider

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,940
doing fixed bit and just being evil that

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,680
may work as well so basically the

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,190
difference being here what are the

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,320
benefits you create a fast value faster

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,820
so you can see see the highest value

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,039
items coming out of its own

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,490
and you have higher quality by default

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,769
because cutting quality is no longer

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,259
beneficial for the vendor in an agile

00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:45,450
process so you will by default you will

00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,220
get higher quality and in the end the

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,100
customer usually saves money as well

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:54,450
I'll get back to dr. topic a little

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:57,779
later like why tourism another case we

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,880
have no product owner I'm kind of

00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,200
assuming all of you know no basics on

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,960
agile process so I'm not going to

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:08,100
explain any of these terms you may have

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,019
to google them if you don't so this this

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,299
is typical for some companies well we

00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,779
delivered all of the like layouts for

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,720
you already and we delivered like this

00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,669
like brick of paper isn't that enough to

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,980
to just implement its you know go and

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:28,440
implement that may or may not work but

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,139
one of the core things how we work with

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,840
customers is it looks like this so so

00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,210
basically the customer has their

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,710
business competence and they can of

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,039
course you know the experts in their own

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,200
business we have competence on how to do

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,210
great projects that are on track and

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,549
reach their goals and so and we can help

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,129
them in that we also have a lot of like

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:52,679
digital companies we have this funny

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:55,259
tool that is like true something that we

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,059
use quite a bit and we do not know a lot

00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,059
about how to do like digital services

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,799
when you combine all of these skills we

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,960
really like to believe that the end

00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,750
result is much better than just the sum

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,580
of its spots so basically when when we

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,860
can give feedback for the product owner

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,750
during the project on how could you do

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,899
this and other different ways of doing

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:19,200
it and so on the end result is is it's

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:22,080
usually better we don't if we just do it

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,450
based on a paper we don't really know

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,070
what's what's the thinking behind of all

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,230
of all of these specifications the

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,090
customer did we can ask the product

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:34,259
owner we can propose better solutions

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:36,149
and so on so that's a that's the first

00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,659
part of this sort of having like one

00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:41,940
team with shared goals it's probably

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,340
probably a good idea for most projects

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,169
so sort of like leaving your bad geez

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,700
when you go in just leave your back

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,859
seasonal table and forget about who

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,899
works for which company just create a

00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:56,549
team that works together for 4shared

00:21:51,899 --> 00:22:01,830
code the second thing this would be your

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:03,450
your traditional project where you do of

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,779
course planning first and so on and so

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,850
on this would be agile project so in

00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,129
theory exactly the same amount of

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,379
planning is still there we don't really

00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:15,809
save on on doing less planning or

00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:18,899
anything like that it's just done in

00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:20,429
different places of a project and its

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,169
most of the planning is actually done

00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,889
with quite a bit more information about

00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:28,350
the project topic it's a topic itself

00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:31,379
this becomes really useful is this if

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,299
this happens and this maybe you're

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:36,389
running out of time you're running out

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,950
of budget whatever have you I don't know

00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:40,350
if this ever has happened to somebody

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,899
that you run out of time or budget in a

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,119
project but if it would if it happens at

00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:47,909
this point in an agile project we've

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,220
delivered the most valuable bits already

00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,889
so more than half of the project is

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,799
ready to be actually launched or maybe

00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:57,749
already launched at this point well the

00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,749
lower value stuff is not done it started

00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:03,210
but it's not done not a very nice place

00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:04,799
to be but it may not be a disaster in a

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,429
traditional project we haven't delivered

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,080
anything we have some code we don't know

00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,600
if it works it hasn't been tested and

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,269
it's not ready to be deployed and it

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,309
hasn't been at this point so so this

00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,820
makes a very very big difference between

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:23,129
like traditional and agile again these

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,230
are some of the tools you hopefully can

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:27,330
use to to convince the customer that

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,249
this is a good idea so basically we

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,129
lower the risk quite a bit what if we

00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:35,190
are late much less from the impact with

00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:36,690
that charm it generates new ideas you

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,700
only have one team of people working

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,950
closely together during the entire

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,369
project so they will come up with new

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,869
ideas because for example all people of

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,700
course they move from project to project

00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:50,369
and customer to customer so they see

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,429
multiple industries so they will have

00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:55,769
new fresh ideas quite often and in the

00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,899
end it's it's saving money if let's say

00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,710
if if you haven't designed something and

00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:01,690
you decided well

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,539
can i implement it you're not going to

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,279
have any cost of from it but but if if

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,679
you already designed it you have a

00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,860
sunken cost for for the design bit

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,929
you're just not going to implement so

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,289
before we move to a case tree like you

00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:23,770
do we have any any questions well one

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:28,630
about do you think a mix of agile and

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:32,169
waterfall is a good route to take I I

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:35,529
wouldn't go there the reason being agile

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:38,200
is a big shift in a mindset and and if

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:40,120
your teams are working like in a

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,250
traditional mindset where all the work

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,409
is pushed to the team so you have a

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,450
product minor manager assigning tasks

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,820
all the time and you are pushing the

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,429
work to the people and on the other day

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,419
they are supposed to pull the work so

00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,730
they are supposed to take responsibility

00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:57,880
they are supposed to take ownership of

00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,730
the work it's a very difficult thing to

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,250
mix between these two mindsets they're

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,230
quite different so in all levels the

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,289
actual the mindset difference is the key

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:13,090
so I wouldn't wouldn't actually a mix

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:15,730
both of these any experience on mixing

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:19,110
mixing these from your organization

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,110
because I know you've been moving

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,680
the water quality

00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:39,299
they connect yeah i would i would agree

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,970
and a mix is rarely a very good idea and

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:45,359
you can't really take the big benefits

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:50,649
from agile if you try to mix it with

00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:53,979
with something like waterfall adviser

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:56,320
one of the sort of eyeopener's when i've

00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:59,769
been trying to push agile within the

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,739
organization is this ah it's actually

00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:05,679
working like we develop drugs we we come

00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:08,200
up with an idea you know we we build it

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,749
we test it we measure it and then we

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,570
learn from it you know it makes sense to

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,159
build websites or web projects the same

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,889
way that was a little bit of an

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,739
eye-opener this learning and the

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:24,639
iteration of it you can't really develop

00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:27,700
drugs in in a waterfall way and and

00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:32,679
mixing the truth to trying then you will

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,690
just miss the point really it's yeah any

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,580
other questions at this point well we

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,099
have a new one how do you manage

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:44,409
projects with a large set of critical

00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:48,070
must have functionality this is a deep

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:50,049
rabbit hole the must-haves the question

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,359
is are they really must haves if you're

00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:54,009
using like Moscow prioritization like

00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,070
must have should have could have both

00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:59,919
whatever however you want to use it the

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,049
must-haves should be something that you

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,169
absolutely cannot launch the product

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:07,539
without so so if that thing doesn't

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,940
exist you you don't get any value out of

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,580
the project could haves should be

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,919
something that it's really going to hurt

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,159
but you can still launch it which could

00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,549
haves and so on so it depends on your

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,129
definition of must-haves but it's it's a

00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,109
fairly large topic area but basically I

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:31,019
would just be really strict on what is a

00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:31,019
must-have it could be when you

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,610
yeah so the comment was it could be when

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,980
am i creating from one platform to

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,600
another yes if you want to do a lift and

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,720
shift project but if you want to improve

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,730
it a bit and perhaps on the old site not

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,640
everything is actually absolutely needed

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,950
to launch the new site likes a full

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,660
content migration if you have 10 million

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,230
pieces of content and some of them don't

00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,840
get any traffic every month but yeah all

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,400
right okay so moving on let's have a

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,680
look at the feedback of it this is this

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,660
is also quite often the case that the

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,950
actual testing and acceptance and

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,470
everything is at the end of the project

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,410
only and there's limited testing and

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,540
discussion and and you know test users

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,240
and everything during the project so

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,190
this is what it looks like basically

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,740
basically you have a goal in the middle

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:26,040
and then you have a timeline and at the

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,440
top line being a waterfall project where

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,720
all the testing and all of the real

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,030
feedback comes from the end so basically

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,090
we do some sort of internal launch or

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:38,310
whatever launch at the end we may

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,770
actually end up getting a bit different

00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,170
product that we were aiming for but we

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,240
don't really know it before it meets the

00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,730
real life or meets the internal

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,910
stakeholders or whatever whereas in

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:52,650
agile we do multiple deliveries so we

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,100
actually get the internal stakeholders

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,110
we can get like beta testers or whatever

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,060
you may have really early working on

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,100
parts of the product and you get the

00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,590
feedback earlier you are still going to

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,810
be off you'll not going to do a perfect

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,600
product on a first try but you know it

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:12,090
much earlier so you get really really

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,640
quick feedback so you know testing

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,310
everything and getting pilot users and

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,840
so on that's very important and you can

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:24,660
only do it if you have something for

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:26,250
them to use make sense another this is

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,310
one of my favorite examples actually

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,290
let's imagine for a while that the

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,440
product we are trying to do is like

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,630
lottery with three numbers and we can

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,780
play the lottery in a way that we pay a

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,240
tree euro lottery ticket you know then

00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,370
we see if we be not that's the first way

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,110
of doing it so average investment

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,660
for the lottery ticket is always 3 euros

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,930
right and that's that's always the same

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,180
and the possibility of winning is

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,970
naturally always the same the second way

00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,570
of pay playing the same game is you

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,490
invest one euro for one number and and

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,440
you only need to commit to buying the

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,920
second number after you know if the

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,300
first number is a winning number or not

00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,670
then you do the same thing for the

00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,370
second number and then for the third

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,260
number well I don't think anyone would

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,170
use the tree URL ticket at this point

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,230
but yet the projects are done done this

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:25,230
way in companies because on average your

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,990
investment for the second case for

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:31,830
successful case is going to be like 1

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,600
point 11 euros and for the first case

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,090
for successful lottery ticket is going

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,280
to be 3 euros and this is based on like

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,929
real options theory so if you want to

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,510
learn about the science behind all of

00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,190
this year you can actually refer to the

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,800
science and not just your gut feeling

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,900
just Google real options and and that's

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,270
that's what's behind it it is kind of

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,070
common sense but companies they don't

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,480
usually think like this it's like no no

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,520
I need to have this fixed bit where

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,370
everything is in instead of let's do a

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,530
small a bit first and see if it works if

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,750
it doesn't makes a song can cost and we

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,760
will just forget it if it doesn't let's

00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,700
build on top of it and let's do do more

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,000
stuff so making them understand that

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,640
doing one big investment on one goal may

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,540
not be the best idea maybe maybe I

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,070
opening fall for some customers so we

00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,380
get higher quality this way we get

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,450
faster learning we save money again so

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,190
the benefits are definitely there so

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,590
just remember to get always back to the

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:32,900
why is it good for you without the

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:36,690
benefits one of my favorites photoshop i

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,280
just read a tweet about like the

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,230
photoshop is the best way to show your

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,140
customer what your site is never going

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,280
to look like something along these lines

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,350
I think that's that was a perfect quote

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,360
so basically if you do design first we

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,520
are dealing with Drupal here drupal has

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,730
existing functionality it has existing

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,230
user interfaces yet many people just you

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,929
know you have your photos of cowboy

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,700
they just go and do something and then

00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:06,450
it gets approved and you're supposed to

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:10,590
implement it asses well the fact is this

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:14,220
is any project you have knowledge going

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:17,040
up and and you have time going going

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,620
horizontally so instead of any project

00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,780
the team doing the project has minimum

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,570
amount of knowledge they will ever have

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,970
on the topic at the end of the project

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,760
they have maximum knowledge on this this

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:32,160
specific project right this is why her

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,870
hindsight is such a beautiful thing it's

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,910
so easy to be smart at the end of any

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,120
project when you know you've already

00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,320
wrapped up everything and then you know

00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,740
so when to win to do all of the

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,320
important decisions in a project minimum

00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,510
available information right so we fixed

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,270
everything before we know what the

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,780
project is going to be all about and in

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,790
a real project if we deliver frequently

00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,320
during the project we would learn all

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,320
the time and the team would learn more

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,210
and more of the project so actually we

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,299
would do better decisions because we

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,650
know more so of course we can't make all

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,750
the decisions at the end of the project

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,450
because you know it's kind of done at

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,190
that point but what we can do is we can

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,070
do all of the decisions at the latest

00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,630
responsible moment so you know sometimes

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,820
not doing this decision is much worse

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,679
than than doing a bad one so at some

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,770
point you have to decide but we can

00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,799
postpone them learn more first so that

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:32,850
we can't do if it's a fixed everything

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,240
bit so how do we approach this this is

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,960
loosely the process model we use at

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,520
window crowd so basically what we do is

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,150
Drupal is a very good prototyping tool

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,770
it's like I like to say that with Drupal

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,620
features are cheap and details are

00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:52,580
expensive you can build a fairly

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,660
complicated site like within days

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,760
functionality wise and then it's going

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,250
to look horrible but it still works and

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,990
and you know with triple you you start

00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,520
the project with the fully functional

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,650
product and you spend most of your time

00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,129
breaking the product that's that that's

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:11,220
the way triple projects code so what we

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,200
do is we have options on in

00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,750
menting something for the product owner

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,510
like there's the quick and dirty way I

00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,340
can do this in 15 minutes and you know

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,010
it's sort of going to be what you want

00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,619
it but not exactly then you have the

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,210
perfect way this is exactly like you

00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,070
envisioned but it's going to take a

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,139
straight through and you may have

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,879
something in between as well and all of

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,090
these being different technical

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,310
implementation options so then what

00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,109
happens is that product owner is the one

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:43,710
who will make the decision which one of

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:46,349
these we should do because if if one of

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,000
them would be like visually brilliant or

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,639
one of them would be technically just

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,340
like fantastic to implement it so much

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,560
fun for the developers the downside of

00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,760
this is like the money is not it you

00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,650
know it's not the developers or

00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,320
designers money it's the customers money

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,720
so we actually make it visible for the

00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,760
customer like look do you want to make

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,349
it perfect and spend a lot of money or

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,140
do you want to do a quick and dirty hack

00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:13,230
and do it very cheaply and depending on

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,640
a case they will pick either one quite

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,109
often they go with the quick and dirty

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
because they're well this is not so

00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,650
important thing let's just do it a cheap

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,869
way first and then see what happens but

00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,790
if it's like that the core feature of

00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,500
the entire site or whatever they are

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,130
more likely to go with the expensive way

00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,440
the case beer being here having options

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,109
and getting the customer to decide

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,560
because they they own the budget in

00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:39,240
fixed everything they wouldn't you will

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,760
just go with the like minimum whatever

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,290
works solution or you may have to go

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,010
with the expensive way because that's

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:49,109
the way somebody drew it in photoshop

00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:51,240
and you know you can't do anything about

00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:53,400
it and it's stupid for the customer to

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,650
spend so much money on something just to

00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,750
make it pixel perfect instead of going

00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:01,430
bubble this is so actually almost good

00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:03,780
enough and it's great cheaper to do so

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,210
there's a principle behind this again

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,589
there's some kind of science I think

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,220
this is economics I don't know if it's a

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:13,619
science or not but at the principle

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,390
which is nothing to do with software so

00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:17,220
it says eighty percent of the results

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,770
are often you know you get it for twenty

00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,750
percent effort so the initial bits you

00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,180
do are very valuable if you start from

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,089
the highest value items and then

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,740
value goes through slowly slowly up so

00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:31,349
it's just a question of at which point

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,450
do we want to stop working at twenty

00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:35,760
percent maybe not good enough thirty

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,579
forty percent maybe it's good enough and

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,790
quite often this I think it in triple

00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,980
this maybe even like 95 five percent

00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,890
principle sometimes because the last

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,990
last stuff you do with the details it's

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:52,260
something like well a marketing manager

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,869
did spot a one small mistake there can

00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,460
we please fix it nobody else ever in the

00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,280
world would have noticed and you spent

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,170
like two days fixing it may not be the

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,359
best best solution cost cost wise so we

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,640
end up with improved product much lower

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:12,930
risk if you approach it like this and

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,589
again new ideas last case unfair

00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:18,930
relationships so basically let's do

00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:20,609
another show of hands how many are of

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:25,020
peace have you seen where the contract

00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:29,670
terms are completely unreasonable or if

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:32,849
you have here okay so this this is what

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,339
what it looks like it's this is

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,230
especially with large organizations this

00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,589
has to do with procurement departments

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,599
and procurement departments often they

00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:45,450
like playing a game called being loose

00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,760
so they think in a good relations if one

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:51,540
party wins and one loses so they try to

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,790
squeeze like as much of choose out of

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,470
the vendors they can basically they try

00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,079
to negotiate the price is they try to

00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,750
negotiate warranties they try to push

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,730
you as hard as they can and and that's

00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,150
not really a healthy thing because

00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,940
that's not a stable like sustainable

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,440
relationship because in any good healthy

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,530
relationship both parties have to be

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,990
happy and if it's a win-lose game that's

00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,940
that's never going to happen so what you

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,799
should do instead is like you can do

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,140
different pricing and contract models

00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:25,290
for example in agile you could do say

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,450
this one which is target price and if

00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,700
you know if you manage to be under the

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,609
target price you get twenty percent of

00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,130
the remaining amount for free as a bonus

00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,630
so you get money for free customer saved

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,190
money and you get money for not working

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,790
pretty sweet

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:44,460
if you go over some defined target or

00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,560
some defined maximum price then you

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,300
actually work for like say minus forty

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,100
percent discount which is really going

00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,110
to hurt you but the customer is still

00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,580
paying for you to work because it

00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,560
shouldn't be for free for them either

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,530
because it's like both parties have

00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,180
failed in this way so figuring out ways

00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,330
where you can see risk and share

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,970
penalties and have like most stable

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:07,650
relationship between the bodies some of

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,060
these are easy to sell to the customer

00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,340
because it's like hey look you know

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,770
you'll save money if if we are faster

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,170
and you know if we if we are way over

00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,230
the maximum price we will share your

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:22,050
pain it's it's going to help your sales

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,640
as well there's a bit of stuff but we

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,470
don't really have time to go into detail

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,020
but it's worth googling the terminal

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,850
five contract model may sound funny but

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,800
the software industry may have something

00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:35,850
to learn from construction industry at

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,310
times this is Heathrow Terminal five and

00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,900
they build it and it was a massive

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,910
success because they had a completely

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,220
different contract models in place and

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,260
yeah just go online there's plenty of

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,550
material read it it's it's well worth

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:53,460
spending a bit of time on that so again

00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:57,060
quite a new quad a nice benefits

00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,640
potentially out of this so I have

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,490
another guest speaker here I would have

00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,010
used more of more of James's as stuff so

00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,990
his James cuts he's a director for

00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,790
product implementation product

00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,670
implementation being American for

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:14,220
building websites in this case and he

00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,530
works for NBCUniversal he is basically

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,840
he brought them from waterfall to agile

00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,970
like the entire organization and he does

00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,100
it for living unfortunately I had to do

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,810
this only over skype so the quality was

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:28,080
so bad I couldn't use more of his stuff

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,930
but let's see what he says about what do

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,150
you ask when when looking for an agile

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,310
vendor so if you want as a larger what

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:39,770
should you do I think the volume is

00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:46,160
hopefully a bit higher on this one sure

00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:48,350
I this study noted the leper trouble is

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,300
will get the vendor to share what their

00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,970
experiences and I found any member who

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,710
is using some form of agile has that

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,990
experience that they're very passionate

00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,880
about it and willing to share and they

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,710
usually have some some type of

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,070
presentation that they're sort of really

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,600
excited to share so you know that's one

00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,000
of the first things I do is just get

00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,260
them to share ask them you know what is

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,750
your experience with agile tell me about

00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:14,420
your processes give me examples have you

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:17,240
done this and usually organization or

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,040
vendors that are that are have

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,170
experience with agile letter are good

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,430
our passionate and they're really

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:28,610
willing to share that information it's

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:30,440
you know when that conversation is quiet

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,090
the response is quiet and it becomes

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,190
uncomfortable then then you know that

00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:37,010
that vendor probably doesn't have you

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,650
know the best experience there but I

00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:42,080
find you know when you're when you're

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,210
interviewing vendors and talking to them

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,670
those that have the experience are

00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,970
usually pretty excited to share it when

00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:54,320
you ask so um you know I always say just

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:57,380
ask yep so be excited about your own

00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,150
stuff I did ask the same question from

00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:03,040
for better to as well and he has a

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,040
different point of view and this a bit I

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,490
think for me the biggest problem what we

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,380
see more most often when we evaluate

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,710
agencies is that there are a lot of

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,590
agencies who just say that we are happy

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:21,590
to adapt to any style what the customer

00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:24,680
wants to do and then there we have a lot

00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:27,200
of we already start already have started

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,540
to have these agencies which have a lot

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,180
of experience from a child already and

00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,200
many of them have already developed

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:38,750
their own way of doing a child and

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,790
that's what we like to hear and we like

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,520
to listen to them and hear their

00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:46,040
experience is why they have chosen this

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,410
certain style of doing a child whether

00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,900
it's internally or whether it's with the

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,809
clients or always

00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,940
I think finding finding your own way

00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,400
with a child that's one thing what we

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,950
look for when we evaluate agencies and

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,279
we highly value those agencies that have

00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:08,510
found their own way of doing a child and

00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:10,309
are really promoting that way and saying

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:15,920
to the client that this is how we work

00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:18,230
and that's really important so find your

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,180
own way stick to it don't do whatever

00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,270
customer asks and I think that's a very

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,789
valid advice because if you do whatever

00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:27,349
process the customer asks first of all

00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:29,930
the customers sort of silly to do it

00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:32,660
because they are trying to tell somebody

00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,299
what tools to use why don't they hire

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,720
somebody who actually meets their

00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:43,400
process instead so it makes no sense for

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,819
for anybody really to do it and I can

00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,170
add some perspective to this as well

00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:52,039
sitting in the engineering department at

00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:53,750
pfizer I often evaluate vendors to build

00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:58,010
websites for us from from a technical

00:43:53,750 --> 00:44:03,109
point of view and what I like to do is

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:05,690
is looking at their processes and their

00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:08,119
tools that they have in place and to

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,130
make sure that the vendor have a process

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,380
in place and have tools and continuing

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:16,970
continuous integration tools in place to

00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:20,029
actually release code or code frequently

00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:23,569
that's paramount I found a paramount to

00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:25,400
learn and measure the success many

00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:28,010
vendors they come to us and say yeah we

00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,869
do sprints but then we don't learn

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,109
anything we don't try we don't measure

00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:35,589
our results along the way having tools

00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:38,900
in place to release your code

00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:41,539
continuously after every sprint or what

00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,180
it be is apparent from from a technical

00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:45,529
point of view so looking at vendors

00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,539
making sure that they have those tools

00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:49,849
in place and have the practices in place

00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:51,410
to support that is of paramount because

00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:55,480
otherwise we will lose the whole

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:58,579
learning process which is so important

00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,809
great let's have a look at the results a

00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:03,920
bit from from the questions so basically

00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:04,670
I'm going to start with the other

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,520
diagram

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,410
so this is how the room looks like so

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,510
how large percentage of your projects

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:17,270
are agile like it surprising actually I

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:20,450
was I was expecting more like companies

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,309
who do exclusively agile and not so much

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:27,619
but most most people seem to be in the

00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:29,089
middle right ok this is this is going to

00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:31,880
be an interesting thing to analyze

00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:35,450
afterwards so what about the issues what

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,369
we have in your room today so demanding

00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,829
fixed everything yes not big enough

00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:43,700
projects fair enough I'll cover that as

00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:47,290
well not understanding agile that's

00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:51,619
actually surprisingly large percentage a

00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:54,770
customer is not willing to engage all

00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,450
other agencies offer fixed prices we

00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,670
have quite a few opal agencies in room

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,980
can we please stop doing that like

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,630
tomorrow I'm not trying to throw

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:07,210
price-fixing or anything I'm trying to

00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:09,589
get rid of this like waterfall mountains

00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,390
yeah yeah I know it's been recorded

00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:18,200
that's why I said I'm not doing any

00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:21,770
price fixing yeah exactly the opposite

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:24,470
of it yeah no fixed price indeed alright

00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:27,170
a couple more things before before we

00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,720
move into the questions so what about

00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:32,690
when should you sell agile I think the

00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,450
most important question was already up

00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,490
there so really what's the size of a

00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,160
project and this this may be bad news

00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:43,030
for for any small shops in here where

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:47,000
where your average project size is tiny

00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:49,520
agile doesn't work well on very small

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,710
projects you can use some aspects of

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,020
that job you can perfectly well you

00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:57,440
something like Kanban in small stuff as

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,119
well but if you look at like anything

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,299
that has to do with iterations and

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,640
Sprint's you may notice one thing if you

00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:08,240
look at scrum for example one iteration

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,790
is chrome is a waterfall I'm sorry to

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,980
break it to you but that's the case so

00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,380
if it's small enough it doesn't have any

00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,859
room to actually start working as its

00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:21,950
intended so don't try to force scrum for

00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:24,380
example on projects of all sizes you

00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,230
need to have big enough project it's

00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,140
scrum is designed for like seven ish

00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:32,569
people team all of them being developers

00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:35,660
and a project that runs for a year or

00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:37,970
more we have plenty of these projects

00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,589
for triple but I know the biggest part

00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,440
of triple projects are not like this

00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:45,079
they are way smaller so so that's where

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,390
where we get to this so tiny i'm using

00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,670
man base here instead of money because i

00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:51,619
know money variety bet from market to

00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:54,140
market so if for example we are doing a

00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:57,589
project in Latvia or in the UK the day

00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,990
rate is slightly different so that's why

00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:01,519
I'm using mandates so tiny projects in

00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,519
my books are like 30 days or less

00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:07,069
Monday's or woman days whatever you want

00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:08,869
to have and and that that would be like

00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:11,000
waterfall thing anyway it's fixed

00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:12,619
everything because you have to design it

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,769
first and then do it it's a tiny tiny

00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:18,559
thing and just get it over with small

00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:22,549
sites oh let's say less than a hundred

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:25,400
days Kanban works nicely scrum ban adopt

00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:28,609
some of the traits of strum into Kanban

00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,160
that may work as well then medium to

00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:33,680
large sites scrum banner or even

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,630
simplified scrum trying to keep the

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,059
overhead minimum like if it's if it's

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,609
less than 300 Mondays and then the sweet

00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:44,660
spot of crumb being with Drupal being

00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:47,539
like 302 to 1500 and mondays this is

00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,490
triple specific in my opinion and if

00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:51,410
it's bigger than that I was split into

00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,960
multiple teams you get better results

00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:55,640
with multiple teams in in that point

00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,380
otherwise it's going to take forever for

00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,910
one triple team to get through it

00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,279
because they are stepping on each

00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:06,109
other's toes all the time and getting in

00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:09,559
a way so split it just get on with it so

00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:11,660
a couple of requirements for for selling

00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,670
agile you need to you need to see and

00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,279
know the benefits you need to know the

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,410
process and you need to have experience

00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:20,329
in it it's a chicken and egg problem of

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,950
course if you want to move to a job but

00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:24,200
you don't have to experience how do you

00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,089
sell it and that's where i recommend try

00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,760
getting a customer that already trusts

00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:30,350
you and knows you and start with them

00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,420
and agree you with some sort of terms

00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,860
like look you know we are practicing and

00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,050
we are sharing the risk and you'll get

00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,550
big discounts and whatever we just want

00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,080
to get started with this because we know

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,510
it's good for us and would be good for

00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,900
you as well so doing something like that

00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:48,320
even internal projects but that's a bit

00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,600
different dynamic and the key thing here

00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,030
is like your sales for has two sales

00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,070
force has to be quite integrated in all

00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,710
of your operations because if they have

00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:00,610
no idea what that gel and all of this is

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:03,020
about there's no way they can sell it

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:05,600
absolutely no way as as you as you heard

00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:07,250
from all of the people i had in this

00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,230
this thing everybody was saying like

00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,600
look if you're not convincing if you

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:16,250
don't know your stuff you will not be

00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:20,000
able to say it right so last but not

00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:22,190
least before we move to questions so how

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,240
do you deal with it when when you get a

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:29,000
fixed everything rfp first of all a

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,770
fixed budget is not the problem that's

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,460
fine i actually like having a fixed

00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,660
budget because fixed budget forces

00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,240
priorities you need to set your

00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,310
priorities you have to move stuff out of

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,870
the project you have to get like the

00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:44,000
least important stuff and forget about

00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,250
it and that's healthy for any project

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,220
there's always some extra stuff that

00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:52,010
shouldn't ever be done in any project so

00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,750
it's a good thing fixed Setchell you can

00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,630
also have that if you have a deadline or

00:50:53,750 --> 00:51:01,490
when to publish fine completely fine a

00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:04,490
fixed scope never in even if like even

00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:07,400
if your budget and and your your

00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:10,820
timeline is flexible fixed scope is not

00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,500
a good idea why because you lose most of

00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,050
the benefit benefits i was talking about

00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,150
you can definitely do it and you can use

00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,340
from to deliver a product with fixed

00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,920
like everything else and and you know

00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,080
the scope scope everything else being

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,580
flexible in the scope being fixed but

00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,250
you don't get most of the benefits of

00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,170
agile at that point so yeah go ahead you

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,170
can do it and you probably succeed

00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,940
because you have like infinite resources

00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:39,170
so you know you became a government

00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:40,880
right now but other than that it's it's

00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,289
not the good idea so how to deal with

00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,130
this is like

00:51:42,289 --> 00:51:49,579
we do three different things in when we

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:52,849
see it sometimes we just decline say

00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:55,549
like I know sorry not interested this is

00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:57,650
mostly mostly if the customer wouldn't

00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:59,269
fit the profile anyway and we just send

00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,589
our apologies and say like you look

00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:04,669
sorry we are not going to take part in

00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:06,829
this mostly we take the middle one we

00:52:04,669 --> 00:52:09,650
decline we explain why we tell the

00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:12,559
customer look we are not gonna propose

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,779
for for your project because it's going

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,519
to fail and we explain why it's going to

00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:19,519
fail and it's specific for the project

00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:22,069
so it is a bit of effort it takes like

00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,140
some hours to to actually explain it

00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:26,359
like because you are doing this and this

00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,709
and it's for these reasons it's not

00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:30,529
going to work and this is what we would

00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:34,459
recommend you do instead and you know no

00:52:30,529 --> 00:52:37,599
hard feelings and that's it it costs a

00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:41,359
bit of time customer may learn something

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,429
for example I've mostly work with our UK

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,650
office because I'm based in London

00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:48,469
helping Steve and my other colleagues

00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:51,229
there and most of our UK projects last

00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:54,319
year or within the last 12 months we've

00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:57,319
actually won by declining funnily enough

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,900
so we say no and and for example one of

00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:02,059
these like large media companies we told

00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,949
them like no we're not going to do this

00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,599
because you know it that's not going to

00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,739
work the response was like

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,669
congratulations you have been

00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:12,229
shortlisted it happens but you really

00:53:10,669 --> 00:53:15,319
need to justify them why it's not a good

00:53:12,229 --> 00:53:18,619
idea and if all of the vendors would do

00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:20,869
this that would be beneficial and that's

00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:22,339
one of my all motivations on actually

00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:24,109
talking about the topic I hope more

00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:26,630
vendors would do this because then we

00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:31,069
would fix this like really broken way of

00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:32,659
procuring IT IT projects well then the

00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:34,849
last illusion being and this is what

00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:38,089
many companies do they still do a

00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:40,369
proposal and and they just say like yeah

00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:42,799
it's you know we can make it at cha

00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:44,509
later and we have time and they will see

00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:47,959
the light and then you know just fingers

00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:50,869
crossed and you can sometimes do this

00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:52,369
but it's a very high-risk thing because

00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:54,510
the customer doesn't really understand

00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:58,560
that child and yeah

00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:00,930
I I would really advise caution if you

00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,540
choose this one you can do it sometimes

00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,430
but be aware it is going to fail from

00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,040
time to time and it can be really

00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,810
expensive when it fails so as long as

00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,720
they are very aware of that that's

00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,880
that's fine so basically now we should

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,290
have some more questions on some time

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,790
for that do we have any Twitter

00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:22,530
questions yes first one what if a

00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,630
customer doesn't have the resources or

00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:27,630
skills required for good product

00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,340
ownership well then you train the

00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,290
customer first of all you provide

00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:36,600
training a big big part of our business

00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:39,780
not volume wise but meaning meaning full

00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,790
length wise is is providing a dull

00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,620
training and coaching just because we

00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,360
couldn't do approach it without it so

00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,430
you support your customer on it first of

00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,900
all if they don't have enough time to do

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,820
it then you provide them with the

00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,380
product owner body somebody who's like

00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,270
an experienced consultant who

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,460
understands the customers business and

00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:59,280
can actually help them in setting the

00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,470
priorities and creating a great product

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,870
so this person is not going to be a

00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:07,260
product owner it's going to be a body or

00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:09,210
whatever you want to call it it's just

00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,830
going to help help the product owner and

00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,110
make the job of the product owner so

00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:17,190
much easier so that's the approach of

00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:21,240
thing then we have a couple of questions

00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:23,720
maybe generally from sales or agile

00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:27,510
methodology but do you want to take them

00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,430
yeah they can fit in fit in here how do

00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:32,720
you sell work that is not immediately

00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:37,320
visible or beneficial to the client EG

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,990
refactoring or API modules oh he didn't

00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,390
work it's always interesting you have to

00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:45,720
make a business case fight so if you

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,940
need to do a refactoring why you need to

00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,500
explain me why if I'm the customer you

00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,360
have to tell me like okay this is going

00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,760
to reduce your maintenance cost later by

00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,070
this and this much but you need to have

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,050
a business reason for all of this if you

00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,940
need to do an API thing let's say you

00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,610
are building an e-commerce site and you

00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:05,520
need to do spend two sprints doing

00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,990
integration to to logistics well if I

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,810
don't do this your pockets will

00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,360
repeatedly

00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:13,010
so just always start with the why start

00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,470
with the benefit what do they get from

00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:17,330
it and also when your devs come back to

00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:21,380
you and say look we have to refactor the

00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:23,360
entire thing why and if if there's no

00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,460
reason if they can't explain it perhaps

00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,010
it's you know not work refactoring it

00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:32,870
sometimes so you know you have to

00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:35,150
justify the money spent how do you

00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:39,440
estimate the budget of the projects when

00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:44,030
selling agile officially or I like for

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:47,210
real officially what you do is you you

00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:49,340
take a book like agile estimation and go

00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,020
through like all the functional at the

00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:55,340
end and it's a very long long process

00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:59,360
unofficially for most projects that are

00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:02,030
like six figures you you know you use

00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,770
the station thing and you just based on

00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:06,680
your experience you come up with like

00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:09,170
well that's what it's likely to be and

00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,140
since the scope is flexible and you know

00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:14,300
what their business goals are it's quite

00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,360
accurate to say like look this is going

00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,950
to be four hundred thousand pounds and

00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,980
you know that you can deliver these

00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:24,260
benefits for that money you are

00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,110
uncertain what the exact scope will be

00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:30,530
but that's fine because the scope is not

00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,690
fixed so so frankly when you have

00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,060
experienced enough people on board and

00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,100
couple of them like do the same sort of

00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,590
estimates and they end up on roughly on

00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,920
same number it's going to be the same

00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:44,600
one so I had my my team in one large

00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,460
project doing like they were like

00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,680
they'll they want to do proper estimates

00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,150
for this and I'm like well I'm just

00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,620
going to put a number here and you do

00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:54,980
your job and have a look at the number

00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:58,220
after you are done I end up in 960,000

00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:02,030
they ended up on 940,000 and they spent

00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:04,070
two days I spent two minutes so so yeah

00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,780
it you know if you don't have the

00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:07,130
experience behind you it may be

00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,810
difficult but then you have to do the

00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,790
difficult way and do proper estimates

00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:13,910
for everything but after you've seen it

00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:17,390
like 25 times similar kind of case same

00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:20,860
kind of our customer frankly I quite

00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,860
often just to educated guesses

00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:27,200
anything else the last one that moment

00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,390
is how do you determine the amount of

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:33,800
hours per sprint and the number of

00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:37,580
sprints it depends on your team size so

00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,470
if if the team is bigger basically the

00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,240
basic formula there is like the bigger

00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:43,250
the theme the less productive it will be

00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,160
per hour spent because you are doing

00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:48,320
spending more time on communications so

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,210
ideally you would use a small team as

00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,369
possible because then your productivity

00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:54,890
is higher and this is especially true

00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:57,890
with Drupal where you know stepping on

00:58:54,890 --> 00:59:00,380
other's toes and all that stuff so just

00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:02,780
first of all look at how small team you

00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,750
can get away with and then do your math

00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:07,970
like okay we need if our sprint is two

00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:10,760
weeks and we have this many days on the

00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:13,070
sprint and this is a budget and then you

00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,720
just estimate it but you can it

00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:16,580
converter I quite a bit because for

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,880
example videos like one week sprints and

00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:22,010
two weeks prints and both of them work

00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,589
just fine it's just a different kind of

00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,270
project where we use the mat and and

00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:28,880
usually the theme is fixed for the

00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,740
entire project so agile actually from

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,900
the vendor point of view it's can also

00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,640
make your resourcing quite a bit easier

00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,890
even though I don't like the word

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,000
resource but still your resourcing is

00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,619
going to be easy because people are

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,300
going to be in a project for like months

00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:43,700
and they are full-time there and nothing

00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:47,300
else so our resourcing spreadsheet is

00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:50,450
really like one like Google spreadsheet

00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:53,359
where we have only weeks and people and

00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:55,790
nothing else and we don't need a

00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,640
resourcing manager or for the map to

00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,390
actually run that that's very simple so

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,210
I don't know if that answered the

00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:04,190
question at all but I hope are there any

01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,720
other we have like 20 seconds left one

01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:08,030
last question we have time for it and

01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,740
then we're done shoot can you please

01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:12,970
walk to the microphone so the recording

01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,970
actually captures it as well

01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:19,620
how should the contractual speed unlike

01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,940
either like post print and then client

01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,680
is not happy and then he can cut the

01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,670
contract but it's like you know 10

01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:29,160
sprains take it or leave it ideally what

01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,170
i would do is like let let the customer

01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,420
terminate the contract at any point for

01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,400
like any reason so they come it only for

01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,410
one sprint but you can also do what i

01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,110
showed earlier where if you are ready

01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:42,210
early for one reason or another the

01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:44,970
customer pays your bones and then you

01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,530
know you walk away we typically have

01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,510
very very flexible contract terms

01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:50,460
because it's based on trust and we tell

01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,900
the customer up front we expect a bit of

01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,180
notification if you want to terminate

01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,540
the project cuz you know we need to sell

01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:00,090
the team to somewhere else so i would be

01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:02,940
really flexible on contract terms so we

01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:05,960
out of time I thank you all for for your

01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,960
time and I hope it's useful

01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,490
