Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Getting a CLUE at the Command Line
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: emmajane
Many of the new fangled front end development efficiency tools require you to drop into the Command Line. For those who are accustomed to using a Graphical User Interface, this can be a frustrating and demoralizing experience. The Command Line User Experience (CLUE) may be archaic, but it is also a very efficient way to work.

This session will uncover some of the mysteries of the command line, and unpack the psychology behind your frustrations with it. We'll dive into details necessary to enhance your appreciation of this simple tool by touching on the following topics:

why you're right to hate the command line (and how you can get over your hatred and get on with your job)
the features of a well-written command line utility (so you can distinguish between the good ones and the ones that ought to make you curl your toes in frustration)
the benefits of working at the command line when things are going wrong (and why things are more likely to go *right* when working from the command line for certain kinds of tasks)
and finally, some simple tips to make your time at the command line more bearable
By the end of this session you should be equipped to tackle command line tasks. Specifically, you will be able to:

create a mental model of the tasks you need to complete while at the command line
locate the command line on your computer
complete tasks using relevant commands
identify and apply troubleshooting techniques if things go wrong
safely exit the command line when your tasks are complete
Yes, this is an introductory session. This is for people who feel shame that they don't know how to "just see Dee into yer root durrr" and get mad when people say "just diff me a patch" as if it's as easy as playing with a kitten. No, you don't have to have Git, or Grunt, or Sass installed to attend (you don't even need to know what they all are--bonus marks if you do though). You don't even need to know where the command line is on your computer.

good afternoon everyone thanks so much

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,839
for coming and I'm going to start by

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,510
doing just a quick audience pull um I

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,679
can really only see the front row super

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,900
well because these lights are actually

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,429
brighter than they appear so can I just

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,529
get a quick show of hands how many

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,990
people are mostly here to heckle me

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,470
which is I know it's the front row so

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,359
fess up okay and how many people here

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,090
have been working from the command line

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,939
for a while and are looking for like

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,859
more sort of expert tips or more

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,750
information you are going to be

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,059
disappointed my friends this is a very

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,500
beginner session so if you sneak out I

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,290
see you're sitting at the edges I will

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,210
not be offended at all how many people

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,079
are here because they are still checking

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,670
email after the last session okay no I

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,410
see no hands because you're currently

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,660
paying attention to email no problem and

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,879
how many people are actually at a

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,469
beginner level and every time they've

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,629
tried to use the command line they

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,239
either turn to the whiskey bottle or

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:05,820
wanted to breathe into a paper bag or

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,110
you are my people okay welcome so um and

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,430
how many people just don't put up their

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,430
hand when asked because they think it's

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,280
a stupid thing great the same hecklers

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,200
and how many people can't understand my

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,250
accent fantastic excellent well done

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,030
everyone ok so today's um hi my name is

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,540
Emma I'll be your host for today and

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:33,750
I've been playing with Drupal for about

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,790
a decade I think and I've been working

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,070
with Linux as my primary operating

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,860
system with the exception of this

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,990
computer for about a decade I'm I don't

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,420
love living at the command line but I

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,659
have definitely made at my home and I

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,780
have learned to feel very comfortable

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,090
there by implementing a few sort of tips

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,439
or ticks tricks or techniques or those

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,110
kinds of things and that's what I want

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,149
to share with you today is basically how

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,130
I made myself comfortable at the command

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,350
line even though I don't really feel

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,240
like I belong there sometimes the

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,700
presentation is divided into

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,660
approximately four parts they are not

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,920
equal length but we'll start by taking a

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,890
look at why I think it's

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,630
so difficult to have fun at the command

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,230
line and really feel like you belong

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,940
then we will talk more specifically

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,520
about some of the benefits of being at

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,400
the command line I will give you the

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,340
advice to group functionality and map it

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,060
to things you know we will use some

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,040
front-end automation tools as our

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,930
examples and we'll sort of map them on

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,880
to with one exception map them onto real

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,910
world examples so i can show you how you

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,480
can do that kind of work and then we'll

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,340
talk about playing the pregame and

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,709
learning the moves before you actually

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,600
get into the real game where you can die

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,739
there I don't play video games at all

00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,940
but I'm going to pretend to do video

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,650
game analogies it's going to be

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,950
hilarious for those of you who do you

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,080
play video games and then finally I'll

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,120
talk about how to not want to throw

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,580
things at your computer even though on a

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,049
fairly regular basis one of my

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,880
recommendations is going to be to not

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,010
get a macbook air because they're really

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,459
portable and they're kind of like

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,380
frisbee shaped sometimes so we'll go

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,870
over some of the techniques on how to

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,910
troubleshoot and just generally how to

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,150
not panic when you're at the command

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,500
line so if you didn't actually listen

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,340
because that was too long of an

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,130
explanation the really big takeaway for

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,959
today is that the command line is

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,850
difficult because there aren't any

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,640
pictures and you will need to make your

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,440
own now for those of you who are saying

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,450
yes captain obvious there are no

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,489
pictures at the command line and it's it

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,310
is an obvious statement to make but I

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,170
think it's one that is the true hurdle

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,269
to feeling comfortable at the command

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,519
line as soon as you come to grips with

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,410
the fact that the command line is never

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,170
going to provide you with a picture and

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,630
that is your responsibility to sketch

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,970
out in other words like get out a piece

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,400
of paper and a pencil I'd start drawing

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,850
out and start doodling and start

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,220
creating a visual map of how the command

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,590
line works until you step beyond that

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,590
hurdle it will remain a completely

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,750
impenetrable place the big reason for

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,210
that is because of the way

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,370
most people think so if you take a look

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,400
at either sort of the top two or the

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,060
bottom two generally people work with

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,950
pictures now I'm sort of one of those

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,110
bizarre folks that like when I close my

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,660
eyes and picture something I don't see

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,000
pictures and I don't see words I here

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,070
since you know I hear things I have an

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,960
audio input i have might have music that

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,420
i hear those kinds of things but but

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,360
when i when i close my eyes i don't i

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,870
don't see things it's just kind of dark

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,040
in there so if you have when you close

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,169
your eyes and you actually have an

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,230
imagination and you can see sort of

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:10,050
worlds inside your mind you may think

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,090
that working at the command line is kind

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,580
of like and again for those of you who

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,410
do video games my like most sincere

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,990
apology for all of these really bad

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:24,270
analogies that don't quite fit but it is

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,700
a fog of war experience I learned that

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,280
term last night I was pretty excited so

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,580
fog of war is when you're playing a game

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,500
and the edges of the map aren't defined

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,419
until you go exploring them and that's

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,180
very much what the command line can feel

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,100
like you don't really know what's going

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,750
to happen until you start typing in the

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,430
commands and you don't really want to

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,560
type in the commands because you're not

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,800
really sure what's going to happen and

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,780
yet once you've typed those commands

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,440
you're still left with pretty much

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,860
bupkis so what you need to start doing

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,070
is figuring out how to create that map

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,860
for yourself and I don't I don't mean to

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,229
trivialize it but it really can be that

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,930
straightforward and for me that means

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,720
going back and looking at things from a

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,590
very very high level overview the way

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,479
that we tend to teach people at the

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,800
command line is sort of a just-in-time

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,419
learning and what I mean by that is oh

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,669
okay so you want to do this thing run

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,520
this command and we don't stop and say

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,410
to someone when we're working in

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,620
front-end development one of our goals

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,960
is automation and one of the goals is

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,910
automation because we want to be able to

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,190
and I'll go into this a little bit more

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,120
in in a few slides

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,640
but creating that 10,000 foot view is

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,760
what makes for me working at the command

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,000
line possible and getting away from

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,610
just-in-time learning so I'm going to in

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,340
some ways teach you how to ask so what

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,620
and kind of reveal your inner

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,870
four-year-old a little bit more and be

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,370
really insistent that people explain to

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,140
you what the benefits are and what the

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,180
reasons are behind running those

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,220
commands and why you should be doing

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:17,310
things at the command line and it um it

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,010
also kind of in some ways makes our

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,430
reptilian brain kick in when we're

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,430
presented with this to look at and it

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,340
becomes almost this like rage inducing I

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,590
don't know what I'm doing here and if I

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,290
type something the world might implode

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:39,030
on me because I'm not really sure what

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm doing so the next sort of tip shall

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,940
we say relies on the the person who is

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,500
in that slide where I gave you the

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,140
breakdown of the percentage of people

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,940
who like to look in pictures or think

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,870
rather in pictures versus think in words

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,730
did anyone recognize the character who

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,500
was on I think it was two or three

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,000
slides previous this is one of those

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,800
exercises where you're going to start

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,320
practicing what it's like working at the

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,780
command line did anyone recognize the

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,850
character from Sherlock does anyone

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,680
watch sherlock okay so if i go back does

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,770
anyone now remember who this character

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,390
is those of you who watch sherlock so

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,460
this character and is whose name it's

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,350
some I'm horrible with names i'm going

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,500
to try and remember but what he does is

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,290
he blackmails people and he Oh spoiler

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,530
alert okay so for those of you who don't

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,060
watch sherlock um this is about to get

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,990
really awkward you may want to just like

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,669
mentally to note for a second and I'm

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,950
sorry if you're watching the video skip

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:49,710
ahead and awkward so this guy this guy

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,660
creates a mental Palace to store all of

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,270
the information for which he blackmails

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,030
people with but he suggests that he

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,820
the files and the information so when

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,010
people are talking to you about the

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,650
command line and how amazing it is to

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,690
use and how it's super easy to remember

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,360
where everything is they are probably

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,240
working within their own mental palace

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,210
and I believe this is a term that dates

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,210
back to sort of Greek philosophy whereby

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,330
you you map out an environment in your

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,160
brain I would suggest you do it on paper

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,260
because again i don't think in pictures

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,830
therefore i can't imagine how other

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,590
people do this so if you can create that

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,430
space and as you walk into the

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:37,530
individual rooms you you map on how that

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,600
information works now I'm not going to

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,940
suggest that your mental palace should

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,950
necessarily look like a palace but if

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,730
you can start to make the connections of

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:51,020
where this information fits in that

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,090
10,000 foot view I think it'll start to

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,380
sort of shift the tide as opposed to the

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,970
gist and time learning of like i'm

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,610
typing this command and i don't really

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,060
know why again take that 10,000 foot

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,100
view backwards and then looking into

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,120
where the individual room is that you're

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,440
typing the command starts to make sense

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,050
so the first thing that we need to start

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,750
doing on all of this is having you

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,490
understand why you would even want to be

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,560
at the command line in the first place

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,420
how many people are a little bit

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,230
resentful every time they have to open a

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:29,130
terminal window be honest the rest of

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,530
you are lying it's actually not a fun

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,290
place at the terminal and it only

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,870
becomes a fun place at the terminal when

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:41,310
you start to see some of the benefits of

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,990
being there and I would say well again

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,210
if we go back to our sort of four year

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,420
old self and we start saying why all the

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,730
time my four year old self and I have no

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,650
memory of this I promise but apparently

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,810
what I used to say to my mom was what's

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,790
the bribe so whenever she wanted me to

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,980
do something I'd be like hey what's the

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,690
bribe so you can think about you know

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,640
whatever your four year old self would

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,740
say if you're a video gamer is there is

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,560
it called what's the payload is that a

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,790
thing no okay

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,520
bad analogy moving on um but but think

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,860
of whatever your personal so what is and

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,450
I would say that the big goal to be at

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,130
the command line these days is to gain

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,930
consistency and now you should say

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,910
whatever your inner four-year-old

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,839
normally says for the so what scenario

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:33,839
how does that benefit me so what well so

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,980
what in this case is that we can now get

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,839
copy paste able commands and I would say

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,760
there's there's more it's like all of a

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,430
sudden one of those like infomercials

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,529
wait there's more but the first thing

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,750
that I really love about teaching people

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,120
version control specifically on the

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,550
command line is that I'm not having to

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,480
say okay navigate to the third menu

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,010
click that down two items Oh unless you

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,900
have a previous version installed in

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,089
which case it's only or you have to go

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,040
down three items and then a new dialog

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,740
window is going to appear I have to

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,440
describe in words of visual experience

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,540
and if the visual experience changes

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,910
slightly then all of my instructions

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,740
become wrong whereas at the command line

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:21,540
if I want to replicate a series of

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,400
instructions I can very easily say

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,160
here's the sequence of things that i

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,740
want you to type in and for me if

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,350
something goes wrong huge benefit in

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,140
terms of that copy paste I can copy the

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,660
error message and paste it into Google

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,630
and stack overflow will tell me what

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,760
went wrong love that but if you're

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,970
working in a GUI that becomes a lot more

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,580
difficult so for me the first so what

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,240
benefit in terms of consistency is that

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,130
copy paste able part so what's the

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,860
advantage the next advantage of it being

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,760
copy paste able anything that you can

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,720
type in words kind of I lie a lot as the

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,150
other thing you have to watch out for

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
this anything that you can type into

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,660
words is something that you can convert

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,130
into a script at the command line and

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,040
again I'm kind of lying but if you can

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,470
issue a command generally speaking you

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,050
can convert that command into a script

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,089
which gets run

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,250
now again your inner four-year-old

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,800
should be saying so what why does that

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,320
matter to me because scripts can be

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,839
automated so as soon as we can start

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,690
typing of the commands we can start

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,089
creating scripts we can run the scripts

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,740
which means we're making fewer mistakes

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:42,649
and we can also start looking at

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:46,100
automation now for folks who are working

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:48,640
on really tiny websites without huge

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,959
sort of staging and production

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,790
environments without the cloud where

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,410
they have to replicate things times a

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,230
million servers because they've got

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,390
whatever thing happening and a million

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,550
people visiting all at once like when I

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,290
say a million people coming to a website

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,170
all at once how many people are like

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,180
yeah I built that yeah there's like

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,100
three point you know as far as you know

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,240
for the recording about three people put

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,300
up their hand yeah yeah no I'm not sure

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,430
Ivan looked at the logs yet whatevs okay

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,450
how many people like I got a hundred

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:27,230
last week yeah okay a thousand last week

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:30,290
a thousand in a day a thousand in a

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,779
minute so as you start to grow in size

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:36,620
this idea of being able to automate the

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:39,500
pieces becomes far more critical so I

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,160
for myself anyways I have generally

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,040
worked on fairly low volume sites if I

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,720
make a mistake oops maybe my mom will

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,440
notice because I told her that I you

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,540
know made a new web page for her but

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,760
generally speaking i'm not doing stuff

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,490
that's super important as soon as you

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,620
start and and also i don't do a lot of

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,959
development anymore i'm mostly on the

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,079
training side and mostly on the project

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,120
management side so as a developer as you

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,860
start to build out these systems which

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,920
get more and more traffic which require

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,899
more and more infrastructure this idea

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,360
of automation becomes more and more

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,180
important to you there's no way if you

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,949
needed to spin up 10 servers you would

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,230
want to be in their apt to get

00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:26,779
installing every single linux package to

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,490
do every single server by hand you need

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,880
to put those automation pieces in place

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,530
you need to have the scriptable commands

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,270
you need to be able to type the commands

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,300
out which means you need to be at the

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,490
command line so hopefully I've explained

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,240
to your four year old self some of the

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:46,940
benefits of being there the next trick I

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,680
would say is okay fine you've convinced

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,850
me that we need to be at the command

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:57,710
line now I would say your next task is

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:59,840
to start grouping the the things that

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:04,730
you need to do at the command line and

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:08,330
map them onto activities that you

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,220
already know about so that statement may

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,950
not quite make a lot of sense yet so let

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,370
me show you what I mean I'm going to

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,710
group our examples into three separate

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,460
categories I'm going to talk about task

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,670
runners scaffolding and package managers

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:29,570
are there any of those terms right now

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,670
and like sorry any of these terms

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,100
without me explaining them that maybe

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:38,060
you've heard before either in a computer

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,700
sense of the word or in a everyday life

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,300
sense of the word hopefully at least one

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,160
of them sounds a little bit familiar

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,650
anyone do any of these terms look a

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,360
little bit familiar I'm shout out which

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:54,200
is the one that sounds familiar looks

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:59,000
familiar to you packaging yep what else

00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,590
all three sound familiar scaffolding the

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,790
outside of a building the thing you try

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,819
not to walk into when there's

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,310
construction happening on the outside ok

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,410
so these words and where it gets I think

00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,510
a little bit tricky is that we use these

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,910
terms and yet I don't always think that

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,709
we're using the best English mapping

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,079
even though when you get into the

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,420
technical definition it completely makes

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,790
sense so let's take a look at the first

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,650
one the task runner and I've picked this

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:29,750
one first because I think it's got a

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:31,310
nice mapping onto onto a real world sort

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,530
of like okay what does this look like if

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,860
we play out this scenario with human

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,410
beings so our task runner in the

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,540
computer definition of it is a set of

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,850
tools to make build operations

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,800
consistent clean and well documented

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,770
they provide helpers

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:53,990
to manage operations on the project file

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:56,360
system via the command line what so task

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,970
runner I think of as the ball runner in

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,470
a tennis game so the ball runner

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,150
whenever things sort of need to be set

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,650
back up again they'll go and get the

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:12,950
balls that we can start playing the game

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:17,450
again so in in the sense of computer

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:22,010
languages a front end task runner would

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:24,500
be a grunt or gulp broccoli brunch those

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,240
words all cluster together they're all

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,670
going to be doing the same kinds of

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,190
things and if I think about this in

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,390
terms of a linux sense although I'm like

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,130
I'm probably the only one in the room

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,800
who's ever going to map things onto the

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:41,090
Linux sense of the word and it's a make

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,530
file for building programs so now I'm

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,670
going to work with the next group I'm

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,710
going to go through these quickly

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:49,730
because I have a comparison chart at the

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:52,910
end so the next one is scaffolding and

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,400
scaffolding design-time scaffolding

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,890
produces files of code that can later be

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,260
modified by the programmer to customize

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,720
the way the application database is used

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,490
and I think this one if I give you

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,730
enough clues you'll be able to think of

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:12,770
a real world example so if you have a

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:17,120
bunch of files that you know you want to

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:21,830
customize if you have a box of Lego's

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,770
that you know you want to customize this

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,890
is like scaffolding is like getting a

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:30,530
kit so you get your kit in the mail and

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:35,110
you can or however you buy your kits of

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:39,980
Lego these days and you can make the

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:43,700
Darth Vader's TIE fighter um or you

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,350
could like decide your inner four year

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,780
old says I want to make something

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,880
completely different you absolutely are

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,190
welcome to do that there's no kit police

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,320
out there who says you have to build the

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,390
TIE fighter so when we're working with

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,130
scaffolding we're getting a series of

00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,860
things that we intend

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:05,600
on immediately not looking like a pile

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,850
of Lego examples of scaffolding so in

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,040
terms of my tangibles my Lego kit is a

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,510
real world example of scaffolding I

00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,000
don't i'm not going to leave it as

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,130
pieces i'm going to start working with

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,070
it front-end development we've got

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,890
yeoman in drupal how many people have

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,990
done front-end theming stuff and you've

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,870
worked with a base theme you rarely

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,760
leave it as a base theme or rather you

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,560
copy the starter kit out of the base

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,310
theme and you immediately start working

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:38,450
with it that's your scaffolding again in

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:40,370
Linux make kind of similar here so if we

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,760
start taking those concepts and we start

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,890
sort of mapping them on to commands

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,490
we've got the idea of creating an empty

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:51,830
shell site or creating a new scaffolding

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,190
site so with compass you build out all

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,410
of the template files with yeoman you

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,420
build out your web app but it's that

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,720
idea of what are the building blocks

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:06,170
that I'm going to start with the third

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,150
group package managers package

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,250
management system also called a package

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,960
manager is a collection of software

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,640
tools to automate the process of

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,200
installing upgrading configuring and

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,140
removing software packages for a

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,690
computer's operating system computers I

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,360
can't even read this stuff operating

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,270
system operating system in a consistent

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,070
manner now I got to tell you I couldn't

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,290
come up with a real-world analogy for

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,940
this one and I think it's probably

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,770
because I've spent too much time at the

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,450
command line and I kind of go yeah I

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,480
know what a package manager is totes no

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,090
problem so can you fill in my blank on

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,990
this one can you think of what the best

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,060
I could come up with was like

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,530
construction site diggers but that

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:54,770
didn't seem very much like install

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:57,200
update and remove can you think of what

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:01,160
might be a real world example of those

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,720
three things install update and remove

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,720
what does that in the real world

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,950
nice o'er afraid our installer they

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,900
bring you a new refrigerator they plug

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,049
it in for you and they take your old one

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,090
away I like that one can anyone else is

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,740
there anyone that's got something that

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,230
they can think of for a package manager

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,910
so again these are the techniques that I

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,280
want you to start using when you're

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,530
working at the command line of like what

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,900
other concept is this closely map on to

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,030
that I can use in my mental palace for

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,620
the command line so that whenever I

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,510
think about this thing I can be like

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,940
ahhh this isn't that hard this is just

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:57,080
the refrigerator thing no big deal I can

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:58,309
handle this yes nice yeah okay so I'm

00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,900
just going to repeat back in for the

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,789
recording it's more like the appliance

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,830
store because I need to be able to

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,470
choose my appliance from the selection

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,900
of appliances and then I need to have

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,370
like I and then I'll go through the the

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,230
actual process of doing the installation

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,720
and having the old one taken away so

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,250
going one step bigger and again the more

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,320
you can talk about these mental images

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,350
the more you can sort of shape it and

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,030
say why doesn't this analogy work the

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,400
more you're teaching yourself about what

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,470
the tool actually does at the command

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,659
line and you don't you don't need to

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,940
stick with an analogy but the more you

00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,880
can start to make those mappings you

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,240
teach yourself what's what the commands

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,700
can actually do so my examples of

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,289
package managers perhaps the easiest one

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,900
for those of you who are working on a

00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,669
mac is the idea of the app store and the

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,650
app store is going to allow you to do

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,049
all of the things that the refrigerator

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,230
or the the appliance store could also

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:56,450
let you do and at the command line on

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,440
the mac if you haven't already installed

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:05,179
brew love brew get that on linux against

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,190
okay yeah because nerd and so there's

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,500
package managers with linux and i really

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,950
like them i prefer the lea debian one

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:16,519
rather than the red hot one um okay

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,909
moving on sorry

00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,099
did I mention I'm Canadian and so that

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:24,619
was the apology thing and then finally

00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,200
under the front-end development we've

00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:31,879
got the node package manager Bower and

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:35,719
Ruby gems so some common package manager

00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:41,659
tasks locate the software install the

00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:44,149
software check if excuse me check if

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,729
updates are available and also get the

00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,519
latest version of a particular piece of

00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:51,589
software and these same concepts are

00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,539
going to be repeatable for other package

00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:55,159
managers of course the syntax will be a

00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,809
little bit different sometimes you'll

00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,690
have some double dashes thrown in there

00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:02,209
for fun turns out they're important if

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,309
you need them but these concepts are

00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,079
going to be ones that once you get to

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,299
the command line if you've got that map

00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,829
for them I'm just installing my

00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:14,089
refrigerator it doesn't need to be that

00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:16,879
complicated so now I I'm not going to

00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:20,059
leave time for you to do this but if you

00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:22,489
were to create your mental palace then

00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:25,129
you would go ahead and take whatever the

00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:27,829
generic definition was for each of those

00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:30,409
three groups of software I happen to

00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,999
give you tennis as the the ball runner

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,459
in the very first example if you

00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:37,639
followed that one through you might have

00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:41,329
had the scaffolding of the person who

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:43,129
sets up the tennis net or the person who

00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:45,349
retrieves the ball during the game or

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:46,909
and then you'll find ways that your

00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,859
analogy doesn't quite work and then it

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:52,579
will get a little bit frustrating while

00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,379
you adjust your the way you think about

00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:57,649
it or your mental palace to make things

00:25:54,379 --> 00:26:00,320
fit a little better but making those

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:02,659
connections diagramming things out

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,179
actually guess sketching things and

00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,559
writing the words down doodling the the

00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:08,599
reason why I keep coming back to writing

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,539
instead of using a computer application

00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:14,749
is that the the process of drawing will

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:18,309
connait will make a kinetic connection

00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:21,589
to the information so even if you're not

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:23,239
saving that diagram that the process of

00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:24,919
actually moving your hands around the

00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:27,019
process of actually manipulating the

00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,210
information write it on post-it notes

00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,159
moving those post-it notes around

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,409
helps to build the neural connections

00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,700
that you need when thinking about that

00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:39,260
information all right so we've got we

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,779
started out with what the benefits are

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,909
your four year old saying so what then

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:46,940
we grouped the information so we didn't

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:49,070
try and learn all of the commands we

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,260
started by saying well how do those

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,779
commands well how does that program map

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,690
on to something I already know the next

00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,700
step is to learn what all refer to again

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,490
really bad video analogies that won't

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,950
actually work and we will go on to that

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:09,470
the pregame to learn the moves so i

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,470
recently downloaded i believe it's

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,809
called revolution 60 it's an iOS game

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,100
and has all female characters and i

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:19,490
actually ended up having a lot of fun

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,399
playing it great great surprise to me

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,289
and delighted to no extent my husband

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,580
who is like what are you doing playing a

00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:29,090
video game I'm like shut up I'm trying

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,830
to like fight things and stuff so um it

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,940
ended up being a lot of fun but there's

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,029
this little thing at the very beginning

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,190
of the game where you don't die if you

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,500
do things incorrectly and you like learn

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,929
how to explore the environment in a

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,140
totally safe way and you fight a monster

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,820
and you'll learn how to like spin and

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,029
stuff I don't really it was cool though

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,299
um so I'll refer to this is the the

00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:55,039
pregame part of the show and the first

00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:58,309
thing that I want to tell you about is

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,779
what I think makes a really good command

00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,490
line utility because I think there's

00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:05,059
some really really horrible ones out

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,700
there so i would say for the most part a

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:10,899
command line utility that makes me feel

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,539
smart is a good command line utility I'm

00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:19,460
like disclaimer alert get does not make

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:22,279
me feel smart so just put that out there

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,380
but I've you know I learned how to use

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,730
it I use it on a daily basis I'm writing

00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,470
a book about it and I I like what I can

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,779
get out of it so I'm willing to put up

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,929
with it so the first thing that I look

00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:38,600
for is the help command and I want to

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:42,480
see that it includes a functional list

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,669
of the sub commands that I can run no

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,919
an alphabetical list so I want it to be

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,460
giving me some tips right off the bat

00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:53,100
and if it doesn't do that I can

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,500
immediately start to blame the developer

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,080
of the application instead of myself

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,330
because they've not given anything to me

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,669
in terms of a few tips to get me started

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,830
so I can immediately start to sort of

00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:08,070
like absolve myself of blame when things

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,500
don't work right away the next thing I

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,290
really like a command-line application

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,179
to do is give me output if I'm going to

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,820
go to the hassle of typing something I

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,980
want it to give me something back and

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,679
some applications at the command line

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,570
you type something in and by design it

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,380
doesn't say anything back at you it

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:31,620
doesn't say well done you or you've done

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,190
it wrong again or anything it just kind

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,380
of like silently succeeds fails I don't

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,410
know so I like a command line to give me

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,210
information back and then the next thing

00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,220
that I really like a command line to do

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,500
and get is actually really good at this

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,370
one is I like it to tell me what to do

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,799
next so when I've performed an action I

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,830
like it to make suggestions on what I

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,530
might want to do as a follow-up so some

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:03,299
quick tips for navigating at the command

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:06,450
line and this is sort of moving around

00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:09,090
your environment arrow keys up and down

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,700
allow you to navigate through your

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,360
history of commands typing the word

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:19,200
history and pressing enter and I should

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,970
clarify this is at the at abash or a one

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,549
of the other variants this is not

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,020
necessarily in Windows I'm going to have

00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,630
a slide for what you should do if you're

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,760
at windows a little bit later on so

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,820
typing the word history will give you

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,280
for that particular environment that

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,840
you've got opened currently a list of

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,280
everything that you've typed previously

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,870
super super helpful if you want it to

00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,790
retype one of those commands and you

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,000
don't feel like arrowing up 50 things

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:50,220
you can type the exclamation mark the

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,780
number from the line in the history

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,760
thing that's just been output press

00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,010
enter and it will retype that command

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,000
for you super helpful

00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,970
the other thing that I really like is

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,610
control our and control our allows me to

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,000
search through the history in a reverse

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:09,210
fashion so three just like little

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,430
pregame things for you then with all

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:14,060
within the actual command that you're

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:16,590
typing out again sort of navigation tips

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,200
when you're typing start hitting tab

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,620
what tab will do is either complete the

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,100
command complete the filename and if it

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,650
knows more things and can make guesses

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:31,290
pressing tab will start hinting at what

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,720
might be available to you if you want to

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,760
delete a word control w jump to the

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,980
beginning of the line control a jump to

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,320
the end of the line control e these are

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,880
really handy if you have a super long

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,820
line that you need to make some

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,460
adjustments to if you're working on a

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,500
Mac like I am and you can't get your

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,670
little pinky over to control very easily

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:57,660
you can remap it onto the shift lock ski

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,430
or caps lock key rather which none of us

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,110
should be using anyways in this modern

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,000
age of not yelling on the internet

00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:06,480
unless you're working in the issue queue

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,130
no I'm just kidding um just checking to

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,860
see you still paying attention alright

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,870
so finding the command line we've got

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,450
our navigation tips and tricks here and

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,960
in theory all command lines should be

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,820
created equal in reality they're not I

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,680
highly recommend using vagrant if you're

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,940
on Windows is Erica here mmm eric is not

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,880
here erica has written a really

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,760
fantastic book on how to use vagrant and

00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,160
I also have some videos up on Drupal

00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,410
eyes me some of them are free some of

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,240
them are not fragrant allows you to

00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:43,980
create an instance of a linux server on

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,660
whatever your current system is so if

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,260
you are on a Mac or if you're on Windows

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:54,240
or even if you're on Linux it ties in

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:59,400
with the Oracle VirtualBox it also works

00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:03,350
with VMware now so you can put another

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:05,940
instance of a machine I generally and I

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,650
again because i like working inside

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,690
linux the other thing i like about this

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,279
is it kind of feels more secure

00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,440
so you can sort of play with things and

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,909
then destroy the machine if you decide

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,529
that you don't want it anymore and i

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:21,690
have to say destroying machines and

00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:24,629
vagrant is kind of cathartic so back at

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,370
the command line again hopefully not as

00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,899
rage inducing now that we've got some

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,870
ideas of where we're going to be heading

00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:33,059
and but we need to figure out what the

00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,519
inputs are going to be and again if i

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,860
come back to the ideas of games i've got

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,860
this idea of a prompt that i'm starting

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,159
with and the prompt is asking me to to

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:48,179
move or to take action so if we were

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,860
working with the old logo turtle thing

00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,500
that is anyone old enough to remember

00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,059
these like horrible computer games that

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,909
we were supposed to be really excited

00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,240
about as 10 year olds okay I'm seeing a

00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,830
few giggles but not many so like the

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,690
turtle walked around the screen really

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,539
slowly it wasn't that exciting kind of

00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,970
like the command line and if you have

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:11,250
done text-based adventure games you open

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:14,760
the mailbox these are things you do at

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:18,079
the prompt we type in commands this can

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,060
be either thought of as a verb or a noun

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,550
commands might be one word actions like

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,339
saying or jump or look at the actual

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,169
command line I might say help if I want

00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,050
to get the heck out of there i tape exit

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:32,010
it will close the command line or

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,899
history which is one of the ones that i

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,960
mentioned earlier to give you a list of

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:40,429
everything that's happened in terms of

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,159
the next step in our evolution i

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:46,050
initially just had take read open to

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,149
that I've added a parameter so I can

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:52,770
take my book I can read my pamphlet or I

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:54,629
can open my window on the actual command

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,240
line side of things i can change

00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:59,640
directories into a specific directory i

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,240
can read the manual page for whatever

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,400
the command is or i can move this one's

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,970
tricky degree of difficulty just

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,130
increased i can move one parameter and

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,880
then there's a second one in there so i

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:18,780
can move one file name to another file

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,720
name or move it in location i can also

00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,430
add in modifiers and this is where we

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,339
often start seeing dashes

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:28,440
they're not always dashas flags will

00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:32,270
have a double dash so when we start

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,950
adding in this is going to represent a

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:38,579
collection of sorry let me start that

00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:43,849
sentence again with a parameter we've

00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:46,470
just got in the whole concept with the

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:49,790
modifier we're going to be telling you

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,550
something about the very next word so in

00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:56,640
my exam my first example of make

00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:59,940
directory I'm saying and it's sub

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,700
directories with that minus P flag when

00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,210
I've got my tar I'm going to be

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,809
assembling files or in this case

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,460
extracting files with the X and the the

00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:13,650
file that I'm going to extract is then

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,809
provided so we've got a couple of

00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:19,400
different layers that can be provided at

00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:24,480
the command or within the command itself

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,579
ten commands that that I use fairly

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,170
frequently when I first started working

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,690
at the command line I actually had a

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:34,200
help file that had the things that I did

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,549
on a fairly regular basis and it was all

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,140
in capitals called help txt and it lived

00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:43,200
in my home directory and I referred to

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,970
it all the time and whenever I because

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,190
in those days I would like email one of

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,839
my friends may like hi I don't know how

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:52,440
to do this thing and they would email me

00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:56,190
back this like amazing command that had

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,930
words like SED and awk in it and and I

00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,059
would like paste the email and I would

00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:02,700
put it into my help file so i recommend

00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:05,910
this to you create your own mental

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:09,089
palace or just text help file if you

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:12,809
want a list of all commands one of the

00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:15,089
things that and i found when doing

00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,530
research for the very first version of

00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:21,119
this talk a few years ago was a

00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:23,880
command-line foo.com / command / browse

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,829
it's not only a list of all the commands

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,920
that you can type but it has a rating

00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:32,520
function it's pretty amazing actually

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,609
and or just doing an image search on

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,410
Google for commands and finding a cheat

00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:38,790
sheet that you can

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,830
anti-odor you can have as your desktop

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,470
run for your desktop background for a

00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,780
while those kinds of things will help to

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,610
expose you to the different kinds of

00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,680
commands but it's very much a

00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,230
just-in-time learning so it's not

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,240
helping you to create the map of the

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,400
relationship between what you need to

00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:03,000
accomplish and the things that you need

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:05,970
to type in Oh finally here it'll be okay

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,690
you don't need to panic when things

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:12,030
happen at the command line and output is

00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,760
presented hopefully output is presented

00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,770
my big tip here is to read that output

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,270
in both directions and I know that

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:23,220
sounds like kind of a strange suggestion

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,910
to make but it's kind of like look both

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,770
ways before you cross the street so the

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,710
reptile brain when presented with the

00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,660
output from get freaks out because it

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,000
says detached head and I got to say

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,080
detached heads are pretty frigging scary

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,500
so if I read this for as if it were a

00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,780
sort of normal command output the way

00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,950
that I've trained my brain to read at

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,660
the command line is to look and yes oh

00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,930
no wait I've got a fancy laser pointer

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,740
you guys check this out okay okay whoo

00:38:54,930 --> 00:39:03,900
so my normal reptile brain goes to the

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,220
very closest thing to my input and I've

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,750
clipped it out on this picture

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,130
unfortunately but the you know the next

00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,530
thing would be the prompt at the bottom

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:13,590
so the I go backwards and time and read

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,240
head is now at something something I

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,430
don't really know what's going on here

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,260
okay I'm going to go up one more okay

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,520
I'm supposed to do a git checkout I

00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,950
don't know what's going on I'm going to

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,860
go up one more and I read backwards

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:28,800
through the information get is actually

00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,110
as I mentioned before really fantastic

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,880
about telling you what to do next so in

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,090
the case of get you actually want to

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,910
read top to bottom and it will give you

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,600
clues on what to do next but if you're

00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:46,050
reading the output of a command you

00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:49,860
actually or the the build information if

00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:51,230
a task runner has gone through and

00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,750
completed a bunch of

00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,550
for you all it's been doing is sort of

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,580
spitting out to the screen what it's

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,890
been up to as opposed to presenting you

00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,380
with instructions so in the case of I

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:06,770
was doing some things and that it broke

00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,600
and that case you're going to start at

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:13,430
the broken bit and look at what it did

00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:16,280
just before it broke so I present you

00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,800
with this slide in the middle it says

00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,780
read outputs in both directions so now

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,910
you can either choose to go backwards or

00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,500
you can choose to go forwards and when

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,300
working at the command line you've got

00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,550
that same kind of decision that you need

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,160
to make you're presented with some

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:33,980
output read it from the top and if it's

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,900
like thousands of lines of scroll that's

00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,340
gone past probably just start reading

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,770
from the bottom and see what it said

00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,770
last but do check from both directions

00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,060
I've gone through sort of a bunch of

00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:54,440
different ways of looking at the command

00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:57,790
line and gave you some examples of how

00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,290
commands get structured I gave you some

00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,390
groupings for front-end development

00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,140
tools and how you may want to map them

00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:08,119
on to specific places and this for some

00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,369
of you will be a little bit of a

00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,500
frustrating presentation because I've

00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:15,260
not actually shown you how to do

00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,300
anything at the command line and now

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,500
this is this is going to be awesome for

00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,660
me because I didn't tell them ahead of

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,490
time so in the front row we've got

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,280
self-identified hecklers who actually

00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,440
know how to use the command line I see

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,770
at least four of them who are now all

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,200
like hanging their heads and like crying

00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:35,270
a little bit so what I'm going to do I

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,590
think we've got like 15 or 20 minutes

00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:41,570
left is I'm going to suggest that

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,430
perhaps my friends who came to heckle

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,500
might be willing to help us out a little

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,970
bit and for those of you I've got a

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,900
summary slide that I'll be her name and

00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:52,400
I just want to tell you where we're

00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,869
going with this it always is actually

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,500
but you have to know what to put into

00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:59,060
google so so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,670
going to say for those of you who want

00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,350
an actual hands-on part you probably

00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,400
have different things that you want to

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,660
learn about I'm not going

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,130
put it into the recording but we'll

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,720
group you into like are you a front-end

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,940
person are you a developer are you a

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,380
project manager who's just like trying

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,270
to figure out what's going on are you a

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,950
designer who's really kind of angry at

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,360
the world right now or maybe you're

00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,100
really excited and it's all awesome

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,800
because you're in Amsterdam we're gonna

00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,050
and I hope they'll agree to do this I

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,750
want to show you some of the stuff in

00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:29,480
practice and answer some of your

00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,430
questions in a more like intimate

00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,770
fashion in the sense of not having it

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,570
recorded so that you don't have to worry

00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,750
about someone hearing your question

00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,430
later and so we went through four

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,990
different parts and I think they're

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,840
going to be game for this so that's good

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:47,060
I started you by by saying I started off

00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,730
by saying figure out how this is going

00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,980
to be of benefit for you nurture your

00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,140
inner four-year-old and start asking so

00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,050
what and why until you can get to the

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,480
point where you actually want to be at

00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,700
the command line the next thing I

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,860
recommended was to group functionality

00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,990
and map it onto things that you already

00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,710
know about get out those sketchbooks

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:12,470
doodle create the neural pathways make

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:15,440
actual physical actions so that you

00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:17,660
don't feel trapped inside the command

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,840
line reptilian brain oddly maybe I'm

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,520
projecting my reptilian brain takes over

00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,920
when I can't figure out what to do next

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,590
and so the more that I can take a step

00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,170
back away from the information and talk

00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,630
myself through the 10,000 foot view of

00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,450
what I'm trying to accomplish I can come

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:38,210
back into the command line unlike those

00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:40,130
war of fog situations just because

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,960
you've exposed something on the command

00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:45,140
line doesn't mean it's going to continue

00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,000
doing that horrible thing until you come

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,970
back and fix it you can just leave it

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,640
there you can put it in time out come

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,140
back understand what you're doing draw

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,760
the picture of what you're trying to

00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,280
accomplish the command line will be

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,420
there for you when you get back learn

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,620
the pregame moves shall we say so figure

00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,770
out you know whether it's how to

00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,270
navigate or generally what the commands

00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,420
are that are available to you whatever

00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,800
pregame means for you figure out some of

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,750
that stuff before you get into a

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,420
mission-critical like oh I really have

00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:20,420
to do this now not really sure how to

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,870
navigate on the command line and finally

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,520
it will be okay you don't need to panic

00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,350
the more that you can turn off that

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,060
reptilian brain and the more that you

00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,700
can ask questions and put things into

00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,770
Google and have people available to you

00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,150
to answer those questions suckers I mean

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:40,850
thank you my helpful friends and the

00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:43,400
more that the command line will be just

00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,290
another tool that you're using so thank

00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,310
you very much hopefully I've given you

00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,870
and if not some information to get you

00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:54,710
going hopefully I've shown you that it's

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:56,240
okay to be stubborn and insist that it
