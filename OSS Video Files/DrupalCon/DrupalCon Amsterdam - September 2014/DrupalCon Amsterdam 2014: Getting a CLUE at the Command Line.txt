Many of the new fangled front end development efficiency tools require you to drop into the Command Line. For those who are accustomed to using a Graphical User Interface, this can be a frustrating and demoralizing experience. The Command Line User Experience (CLUE) may be archaic, but it is also a very efficient way to work.

This session will uncover some of the mysteries of the command line, and unpack the psychology behind your frustrations with it. We'll dive into details necessary to enhance your appreciation of this simple tool by touching on the following topics:

why you're right to hate the command line (and how you can get over your hatred and get on with your job)
the features of a well-written command line utility (so you can distinguish between the good ones and the ones that ought to make you curl your toes in frustration)
the benefits of working at the command line when things are going wrong (and why things are more likely to go *right* when working from the command line for certain kinds of tasks)
and finally, some simple tips to make your time at the command line more bearable
By the end of this session you should be equipped to tackle command line tasks. Specifically, you will be able to:

create a mental model of the tasks you need to complete while at the command line
locate the command line on your computer
complete tasks using relevant commands
identify and apply troubleshooting techniques if things go wrong
safely exit the command line when your tasks are complete
Yes, this is an introductory session. This is for people who feel shame that they don't know how to "just see Dee into yer root durrr" and get mad when people say "just diff me a patch" as if it's as easy as playing with a kitten. No, you don't have to have Git, or Grunt, or Sass installed to attend (you don't even need to know what they all are--bonus marks if you do though). You don't even need to know where the command line is on your computer.
