Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Open Source Design
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: jancborchardt
Open source becomes more and more important in an age where the web is mainly run by companies. At the same time, as more normal people are interested in keeping their stuff safe and secure, design and user experience is a key point of the success of software projects.

Luckily it’s not that bad anymore. There are quite a few designers working in open soure now – but we need more! And we need to work together!

I worked as designer with lots of open source software projects and will present the methods I use every day at ownCloud to improve open source design.

Some topics I will cover:
* how to establish a design culture in your project
* how to work together with developers
* making designers develop and developers design
* getting university students involved
* the importance of cross-project collaboration

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,519
I'm young hey I'm new to the Drupal

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,849
community I use Drupal a bit and am very

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,880
happy to have been invited by Luis to

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,520
speak about open source design and yeah

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,650
I will I will present a bit of the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,050
methods that we use a known cloud and

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,840
how we we handle design and own cloud as

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,920
a general example of an open source

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,779
community doing design so yeah one of

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,750
the one of the first things it's kind of

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,579
funny I just I just found it the other

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:43,530
day is um nope that's not supposed to

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:47,280
happen okay so thank you thank you that

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,829
was it um please write the session no

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,559
let me see okay so let's try that again

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:59,359
yeah so that's actually the the funny

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,840
thing I wanted to show we're preparing a

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,460
possum open source design dev room and

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,189
we were having a discussion about the

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,490
title so kind of a bike shed among

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,110
designers so it's even even common among

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,659
these honors to argue about like what

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,430
exactly it should it should be like the

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,259
original tiles user interface design and

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,240
free and open source software no Sara

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,240
should be shorter open source design

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,689
some people are saying good then some

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,750
argument and shoot ensued and yeah it's

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,920
just because like someone also says

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,780
which is interesting because i heard

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,189
that as well well design can be many

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,369
things like it can also be systems

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,320
design or database design i choose open

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,329
source design i hope you understand that

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,130
and i'll just proceed with that i just

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,180
found it funny to have a bike-sharing

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:52,049
discussions with designer oh yeah that's

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,360
me that's a last Halloween I'm dressed

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,560
up as our favorite browser if you can

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,590
see that it's only one of the problems

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,969
in open sources enemy nice every every

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,670
web developer has that but yeah I also

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,580
wrote usability in free software it was

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,690
a thief

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,670
is basically about yeah it was two

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,880
thousand two thousand eleven I wrote it

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,770
about my experience at that time like

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,420
also working on own cloud working on

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,520
diaspora and on other open-source

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,590
software projects so basically is a

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:33,060
guide to to do testing to do prototyping

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,280
to do reviews and that's online as well

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,530
and it's kind of the the fourth freedom

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,150
of free software freedom to use the

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,490
program effectively efficiently and

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,620
satisfactorily like the usability

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:51,280
definition yeah so that's that's kind of

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,590
also thing which which condenses the

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,720
experience of open-source design and

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,600
tries to also help people so if you want

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,370
to have a reader of the presentation to

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,870
directly apply it to your project that's

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,209
probably the best bet so I said I work

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,860
on on cloud for those of you who don't

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,370
know on Cloud you know on class who

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,440
doesn't know on cloud okay so own cloud

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,320
is basically a free and open-source

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,830
alternative to dropbox or google apps

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,780
right you can have sinking and file

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,580
syncing and sharing its it's a PHP web

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,489
app at the core you put it on your web

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,890
space as well and you can have sinking

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,800
apps you can have a smartphone app a

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,480
desktop app and it just sinks your files

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,510
you can sync your calendars and contacts

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,360
and stuff yeah so like iCloud google

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,209
drive and all that stuff and it's open

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,980
source is a GPL and yeah it's PHP

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:51,220
JavaScript HTML CSS and we recently

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:55,450
released version 7 that's not version 7

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,550
let's version 1 and this talk basically

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,440
I with this dog i want to show you how

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:04,630
we came from this from version 1 which

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,930
is from 2010 and ending of 2010 to this

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,290
which is version 7 at the moment so you

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,650
have the file manager and the sidebar

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:20,709
for sorting and yeah the app switcher

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,690
and stuff so I'm I found that I mainly I

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,270
mainly used

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,820
rules or there were six big things or

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,440
six big topics that that I that I did

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,830
during that time like building own cloud

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,600
I I came I came into the project when it

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,250
was very young where was like five

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:42,370
people for people and I was the first

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:44,260
designer and so it is kind of a a good

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,070
example to build that from scratch of

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,320
course when you have an existing

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,530
community like drupal it's it tends to

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,720
be hard to do specific parts and to make

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,430
them better when it's already a big

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,100
bunch of stuff already existing right

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,050
and then the cost of change is very high

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,500
but many of these things you can also

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,830
apply to Drupal so the first thing we

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,230
won is design it well it's a totally

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,880
epiphany I know right it's a it's the

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,010
base rule like if you don't do anything

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,660
else then you need to design it well

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,550
like if you're a designer even if you're

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,070
not a designer the basic thing that you

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,080
need to do with the software is design

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,440
it so that it that it works and looks

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,740
nice and it sounds strange or obvious

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,500
but that's the the basic thing that you

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,230
need to do if you don't do anything else

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,150
so for example this is the on plat first

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,030
round wizard in version one you see a

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,940
bunch of fields I even needed to modify

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,490
it so the so the width it fits on this

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,430
slide right because it it puts the

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,210
fields all the way to the left of the of

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,680
the window of the viewport and yeah a

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,060
whole bunch of stuff going on here write

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,580
a whole bunch of fields you can set

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,919
forth ssl you can set enable automatic

00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,640
backup date format and stuff all these

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,640
small things that that not really

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,100
everyone needs right so the current the

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,820
current install wizard looks like this

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,800
it's just two fields one is the admin

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,560
user that you want and one is the

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,280
password and it's it's kind of

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,870
deliberately in Spanish because you also

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,180
need to test if it works in other

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,610
languages right I did an ideal interface

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,830
should also work if you set it to

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,940
Chinese or something to through cues

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,070
like an input field or to through input

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,169
fields or buttons which make it obvious

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,310
how you will need to need to proceed

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,990
through the installation

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,690
or through any process right so I often

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,740
actually set the interface to 22 French

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,510
or Chinese or Spanish or whatever also

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,190
because I want to learn it a bit but I'm

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,160
not sure that's a particularly good

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:56,110
tactic to to learn Spanish anyway so

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,880
that's one thing I focused very early on

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,590
on the installation because i think the

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,320
installation is especially with open

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,760
source software or with web-based open

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,500
source software is one of the most

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,780
crucial parts right because you need to

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,400
you need to download it and you set it

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,430
up on your server you need a server in

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,920
the first place and the thing that you

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,290
can't solve with this simple design

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,730
stuff is a permissions management for

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,340
example you always need to set

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,690
permissions for for Sun folder I mean

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,670
with Drupal is the same right you need

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,130
to you need to copy to configuration

00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,050
files and set the permissions and give

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,990
the right permissions to one file

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,920
subfolder and that you of course need to

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,650
do as well for own cloud but one thing

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,690
which which links up the the technical

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,190
and the design aspect in a very nice way

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:48,700
is a SQLite in this example and we have

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,050
we have SQLite support so that sqlite

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,760
for those of you who don't know it's

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,030
very simple database just a single file

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,520
and yeah you can create it on the fly

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,660
from the installation so where we

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,870
previously had this this these four

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,640
fields right where you put in your mysql

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,410
data and you need to need to know what

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,180
it is you need to look it up on your

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,670
hosting provider and you need to copy it

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,350
over and it's it's total hassle you

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,900
don't need to do any of that here right

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,720
um the only the only hard part is like

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,790
thinking of a good username and so

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,100
that's where a technical aspect plays

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,310
into the design so you also need to

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,680
juggle that with with developers or with

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,580
the general aim of the project you can

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,340
always change it like the thing under

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,350
the input field that's a an Advanced

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,820
Options thing like where you can set

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,190
database options so you can always

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:48,040
change it but the default is the the

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:50,170
simplest one of my favorite quotes to

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,769
that extent is I have a pending

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,920
from 2002 already he worked at Red Hat

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:59,769
at that time and he said reading dozens

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,779
of Nome and red hat bucks per day I find

00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,269
that users ask for preference by default

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:07,149
that means is when you have a discussion

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,240
on a specific feature or people aren't

00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,209
able to do something correctly or can't

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,130
find something the solution is always

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,829
that they ask we can't we make it a

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,339
preference right if there's a view which

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:23,110
is not correctly designed or laid out

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,610
then they ask for something and and

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,959
directly ask can we at least make it a

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,639
preference but I really try to not fall

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,480
into that trap of making preferences and

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:37,630
making options but rather design it well

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
and there's almost always a solution a

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,639
better design solution than just adding

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,490
preference so in that sense I'm i come

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,949
from the gnome design school I would say

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,779
like kanamu you know ignore my assume

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,940
the the the operating system they're

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,709
notorious I would even say for their

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,449
simple design and I really like it and

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,880
yeah so that's that's also where a lot

00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,920
of this was influenced on and might not

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,140
work for for all the things but then

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,180
like Nomi even has extensions for

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,000
example and and and Drupal as modules

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:15,220
and we have apps and so you can always

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,949
extend stuff because the the core thing

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,480
is that designers like well design stuff

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,980
and if you don't want to be the only

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,829
designer or if you want to have

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,420
designers in your project then you need

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,630
to design it well all right the first

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,949
thing because otherwise people are not

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,079
going to or designers are not going to

00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:33,250
look at it because they like to use

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,870
well-designed stuff because they're

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,110
designers they have a sense for it and

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,420
so it needs to be beautiful or nicely

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,390
usable for designers to consider

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,720
contributing to it or consider using it

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,949
and to that extent it goes it goes for

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,430
everyone right everyone likes well

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:53,470
design stuff and so that you basically

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,069
you basically kill two birds with one

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,380
stone and in that matter so one one

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,800
example of very simple thing that you

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,030
can do is the typeface so free sands is

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
one example of a

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,600
open source type phase it's quite okay

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,680
it's similar to Helvetica you could say

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,500
to other ones which are pretty cool

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,770
which are more similar to two frutiger

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,900
or like a general text text type phase

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,100
our source sounds pro and open sans the

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,350
right one we use a known cloud for

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,060
example I like a typo a geek info I

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,860
tested those two against each other and

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,990
open sans that could perform

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,270
considerably better than insourced and

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,370
so if you consider a typeface i would

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,700
say open sciences the best one of the

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,250
best open source one i would say right

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,840
that's yeah the already changing the

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,820
type is like when we change the typeface

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,030
i think we only did it with own cloud

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,770
seven globally like before that it was

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,870
set by the by the operating system right

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,630
you just had this simple rule like where

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,060
you say like helvetica neue helvetica

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,910
and aerial or whatever and you just let

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,440
the the operating system choose but that

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,730
first of all you get like you get layout

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,190
layout differences in between browsers

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,350
between operating systems so the best

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,530
thing is to do this the web font thing

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,560
the font face and and decide on one

00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,050
great font I mean for Drupal it changes

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,020
between teams but for the default like

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,880
for the admin interface or something

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,100
there it's like for any project it's

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,810
very good to to decide on a typeface

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,070
because that instantly makes it look

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:36,310
better another thing is icons for that I

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,630
can really recommend the noun project if

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,120
you don't know that it's just the noun

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,690
project com and basically what it means

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,360
for every noun they have icons where I

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,510
mean not for every noun but for really

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,190
many nouns and they have multiple icons

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,500
for each and you can upload your own and

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,270
their most of them are creative commons

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,390
attribution or even public domain

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,520
licensed and you can even pay to not

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,940
attribute or whatever alright it's it's

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,830
very it's a very very big library of

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,810
well-designed icons and they're all

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,040
monochrome so you can use it them pretty

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:15,580
much anywhere and one important thing

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,220
that we actually fell victim to kinda or

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,079
or I also

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,660
and forgot about the website like the

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,699
project website on cloud org it used to

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,069
look not that not that great for a

00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:28,980
pretty long time and now it looks really

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:30,689
good I think and that's a general thing

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,120
like for any open source project be it

00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:35,189
be at a module or be a small project

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,620
being a bigger project that's where

00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,819
people will go first when they when they

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,389
want to contribute when they want to

00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:46,259
look at your project so that's a really

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:48,629
important thing and so what I found it's

00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,569
a lot about like in the in the design

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:53,310
world I in the open source design world

00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:55,199
there's kind of this thing when you're

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,410
an open source developer you have this

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,089
kind of open source Street credibility

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,680
where you have your github profile or

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:07,050
your whatever code profile and people

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,819
kind of look at it and they see on they

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,399
contribute to this open source library

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,560
or to this to jquery or whatever and

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,240
that's kind of cool right but designers

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,029
don't have that right if you contribute

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,149
it if you say you you contributed to to

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,399
this library or or or to that piece of

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,899
software other designers are not

00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,819
necessarily going to be oh wow that's

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,829
awesome it's really cool I use it all

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:30,990
the time they're probably not going to

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,269
even care right so I think that's a

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,939
really really important thing that we

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:38,730
need to establish this in the design

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,649
community like that you get a design

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,160
street cred if you do cool stuff in open

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:46,019
source and you also need to establish

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,170
that in your own project you need to

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,350
establish a design culture so this is a

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:58,649
I think it's really a nice illustrating

00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:01,319
comic it says so the dude on left he did

00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,839
his graffiti very very neatly wrote

00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:05,819
Edward with a dot on it and he says yeah

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,370
well legibility and correct punctuation

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:13,319
might not be street but that's how I

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:15,389
roll so you need to in the in the yeah

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:17,790
wild developers open source developers

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,939
world you need to make it cool to be

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,720
exact and to be thorough and to have

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:27,300
everything well designed and I got

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,899
another great quote for that it's by

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,069
Buren ballot from 2011 and said if

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,589
various people work on the same

00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:36,480
interface they will need to justify what

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:39,119
they do convince others why there are

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,410
Diaz are so great so it's all about

00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:44,670
documentation essentially because yeah

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,619
when you work with when you work with

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,749
anyone who doesn't know that well about

00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:50,910
design when you when you work with

00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:53,249
anyone who comes to the project as a new

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,800
person everything needs to be documented

00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:58,949
well right just as as you have commit

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,259
messages or you have issue discussions

00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:04,939
on new or new features you need to have

00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:07,139
the same for design so a lot of this

00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:08,879
what I was inspired by comes from the

00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,279
genome design wiki they do very very

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,079
thorough design planning's they have for

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,619
every app they first look at the

00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,839
existing apps so what I say a music

00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:21,389
player they first look at the existing

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,420
apps like on iOS on android on on

00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:27,179
Windows on OSX on webos webos is

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,889
actually a really good example that they

00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,889
often that they often take because it's

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,980
well designed and they put that on this

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:37,379
side on the wiki page and then they

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,360
comment on it and they put their

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,839
mock-ups below that and then you can see

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,269
how the thought process went what they

00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,879
what they went through what they what

00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:49,679
they looked at and that's a really good

00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,939
example of documentation and of

00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:56,100
establishing this yeah this culture of

00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:58,920
having design be this thing that you can

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,829
grasp and not not a lot this is the real

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,569
thing oh it's designed and it's it works

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:08,490
well because it's always for a reason

00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:11,669
and another thing but I this is it's a

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,799
great article by Alex fabric of Mozilla

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,189
I think he's not with Mozilla anymore

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,779
he's working at Google now I think but

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,669
he wrote this article on your ex

00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,149
magazine about quantifying usability

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:27,149
basically about how you can use issue

00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:30,120
tags to to make the make the issue

00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:32,669
tracker a more usable or more more

00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,850
useful for design contributors and also

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:40,679
for for the whole design topic right so

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:44,559
he defined these 17 tags all starting

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,539
with you x which which yeah if

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,759
mine is specific or which are about a

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,519
specific topic so you ax feedback first

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,230
one very obvious if there's feedback

00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,090
missing or if there's just a spinner

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,179
missing that's aux feedback issue so you

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,519
always need to make the the person where

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,049
the user aware of the the state that the

00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,990
let the app isn't so I'm not going to go

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,669
through them all also because I because

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,190
I think for most projects is kind of

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:11,769
excessive I mean for the scale of Drupal

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,100
and Mozilla I guess might be useful or

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:17,159
is probably useful I don't tell we only

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:21,220
use one tag we only use the design tag

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:23,649
so we have about I know a thousand three

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,549
hundred open issues not that much from

00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:29,799
your point of view I guess and if those

00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:33,639
160 or so our design issues there was

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,320
one one point where one developer added

00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:37,419
a new issue and tagged it with usability

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,700
and I was like that exit we're just

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,799
taking design and I deleted it and

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,899
edited to it he was saying well but it's

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,029
kind of different and where it comes

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,860
back to the to the bike sharing

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:49,749
discussion at the beginning I don't

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,080
really care like everything which is

00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:56,769
it's related to front end to design to

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,940
usability its design ok so it's it keeps

00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,549
it very simple it keeps it very

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,549
approachable for new people to have just

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,249
this single tag and I can look at it and

00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:08,559
then just go through the issues and see

00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:13,869
it see what they what they can fix for

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:16,509
example and yeah that's the that's the

00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:19,720
the the queue of that so we use github

00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:21,999
at own cloud yeah I know it's closed

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,889
source it's not super awesome in that

00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:26,590
regard but it's a really great tool and

00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,059
the issue tracking is a lot of people

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,240
say it's very simple but I think it's

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:34,389
really just right so you can you can tag

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,119
the the the pull request as well the

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:40,330
merge requests and you see it's not only

00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,879
me who does these files these issues or

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,100
who fixes these issues it'sit's other

00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:48,220
developers to like those two people they

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,610
they are not designers but they're also

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,279
concerned like through the the tag being

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,779
in there they're also working on design

00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,240
or I mean they're also working on design

00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,920
but it gets more exposure through the

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,540
Dean in the issue tracker and that's the

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,900
important thing that you are where the

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:09,490
developers are and yeah just like you do

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,179
drupal 8 usability and you have the list

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,830
of the usability issues so what I

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:19,360
noticed though is that there's like a

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:21,370
bunch of different issue tags so for me

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,110
as being like new to the community it's

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:27,160
very difficult to know like hey which is

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:30,190
actually the what is actually the tag or

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,110
the thing that I should be looking at so

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,700
that's I mean but probably it's a

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,410
different scale because Drupal is much

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,800
bigger than on cloud but maybe something

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:42,429
to think about then onwards to the

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,130
issues themselves we do I mean at first

00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:47,710
we have normal issues as well like just

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,260
one sentence people asking for a feature

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,800
or something but this is for example a

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,600
design specification basically when i

00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,280
open an issue for for specific new

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,050
feature i always right not a lot of text

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,320
but enough text to make it to make it

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,850
explanatory and then i add a mock-up so

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,110
in this case it's just a simple marker

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:13,540
on flip chart mock-up and yeah because

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,780
it's very important to keep it keep it

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,850
dirty keep it fast and simple so that

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,110
doesn't seem to people like it's the

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,470
thing all right that it's the pixel

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:26,910
perfect the pics of perfect realization

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,559
like that's what it what it got to be

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,690
because it's always going to be

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,450
iteration after iteration when you work

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,910
on that so there's like you see here 12

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,320
participants on the on the right there's

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,890
a there's a whole discussion thread

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,440
going on there and yeah those other

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,780
participants are like none of those is a

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,270
designer and that's pretty cool too like

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,370
to ping pong with with the mock-ups and

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,590
the discussions and that's basically how

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,260
we do all design I would say it's like

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,420
and or most most of the design like when

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,520
there's new thing coming up there's an

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,340
issue with the spec another similar

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,890
example is this where it's a bit more

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,250
high fidelity mock-up in this case it's

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:11,800
with with a mock-up software and yeah

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,750
but the thing is the same

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,420
text there's mock-ups explanatory text

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:20,860
and yeah that's the baseline always and

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,470
yeah as a designer you of course need to

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,480
do it yourself like no one or not

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,310
necessarily someone is going to ask you

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,050
hey can you make me this mock-up they're

00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,910
just going to go ahead with it before

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,460
you can even talk to them so you need to

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:38,020
proactively think what needs smoking up

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,010
and just do a mock-up and present it to

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,880
them and they're going to be happy about

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,100
it probably so for mock-ups personally I

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,930
use mostly pen and paper but when it

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,460
comes to these higher fidelity things I

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,340
find that it's really easier to actually

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,870
use a software I didn't use any mock-up

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,790
software for a long time because it was

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,590
just too much fiddling around but if it

00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,400
gets a little more complicated then

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:03,100
that's really cool so pencil is a is an

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,450
open-source mock-up software used to be

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,190
a firefox extension now it's a

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,310
standalone software open source

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,970
cross-platform it's pretty awesome and

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:15,820
so that were the best thing about that

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,680
versus pen and paper is also that you

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,420
can share mock-ups so this mock-up for

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:25,600
example was done by also a developer and

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,850
this is already a late iteration so it

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,690
was it was looking quite differently

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,520
before I mean the the the mock-up is

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,290
already like you see the date from 2012

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,720
but this is mock-up for the news reader

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,450
app in on cloud and it pretty much looks

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,660
exactly the same or very similar to this

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,220
mock-up luckily through yeah us doing

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,820
the mock-ups before we had a really

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:51,190
clear vision of how we wanted to be and

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,560
yeah so the iterations before hand are

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,980
really really important there this is

00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:01,270
another example just a developer doing a

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,270
mock up for the mail app and there they

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:09,280
even like put notes and yeah it's just

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:11,170
very cool to see ya then like people

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,630
making mock ups on their own and it kind

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,240
of kind of bleeds off from you and to

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,490
into the the developer community and

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,400
then you don't need to make as much

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,080
anymore yourself right you you you get a

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,049
bit of the burden lifted by the others

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,330
and developed

00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:29,190
start to get an understanding of the

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:33,239
design process which is which is really

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:36,330
valuable and yeah to come back to the

00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:38,669
ugly mock up again this is one of the

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,850
earliest mock-ups I did I think probably

00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:43,919
well on a bus or something very shaky

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:46,110
for owncloud contacts app but

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,570
nevertheless it's a pretty good

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,700
representation of what actually happened

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,379
then right i mean you have a basic you

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,639
don't need to read the text Reggie you

00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:57,179
just need the basic information

00:24:53,639 --> 00:25:00,509
architecture and yeah just just iterate

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:04,820
iterate iterate and throw it away and do

00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:07,350
new ones and it's really important then

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,659
when you have developers at the point

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,059
where were they design and where they do

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:15,119
these mock-ups then you also need to

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:17,549
need to know that that you also need to

00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,489
you to jump in and then we come to the

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:23,129
third rule and that's designers develop

00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:25,590
that's me hacking away on a on a

00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:28,379
treadmill that's what I always do you

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,929
will find me at home on my treadmill and

00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:32,820
with my laptop it's very important to

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:36,769
work out while while sitting on laptop

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:40,590
all the time so as notice before maybe

00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:43,230
the topmost two issues they were pull

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,399
requests so I also fix my own issues or

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:51,570
I also fix the design issues I also do

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:53,009
code and I I still do even though we

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,529
have like a larger community of

00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,119
designers and that's really important

00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:58,859
also for the street cred because

00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,570
otherwise developers are just going to

00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:06,239
say ah they just like just does the the

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,159
mock-ups and lets us know like we should

00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:11,429
do it this and like this and that but if

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,989
you actually do the code then yeah I

00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,299
think it's pretty much essential for any

00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:17,940
designer to be a front-end er which can

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:20,730
do if we can do HTML and CSS and

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,369
hopefully even a bit of JavaScript to to

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:27,989
make real the stuff that they envision

00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:30,419
and another good point or really

00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:32,879
important point also which we also have

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,249
neglected a bit before like we're one

00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:37,350
year ago is a good CSS and HTML

00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:38,940
documentation so this is the

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,860
documentation of our

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,030
of the building blocks for apps

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,950
essentially so the HTML structure that

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,140
you use when you use that structure

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,990
below for example for a nap you will get

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,670
a sidebar in a list and it will be

00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,280
nicely styled by default right you don't

00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,590
need to do anything yourself and we're

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,650
getting more and more of these default

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,440
styles in it's kind of like kind of like

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:08,190
design patterns but it really doesn't

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,990
require you to too yeah it just requires

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,270
you to write the correct HTML and then

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,860
that's it and that's i found that

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,220
immensely helpful right because it also

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:22,460
instantly makes all the apps look look

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:25,440
at similar or like out of one flow and

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,290
that result in a very very good user

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,210
experience because there's always the

00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,610
navigation on the left for example or

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,930
there's always buttons always look the

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,800
same of course like that's one of the

00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:40,350
basic things and yeah so the CSS for

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,800
that we we just have in core but each

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:46,890
app of course use the different HTML and

00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,890
can override of course and there is also

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,820
some default I can set which you use by

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,820
just using the class like I can dash and

00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,430
then check mark or like in person or

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:03,780
whatever so you can easily use the icons

00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:06,210
that are that every other app use and

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,280
what I found really important is to be

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,220
actually pair programming or pair

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,870
designing together with the as a

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,440
designer together with the developer and

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:20,130
vice versa because that just really

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,110
takes the collaboration or the bleeding

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:26,310
off of your skills to the next level

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:29,790
it's a yeah one great example i think is

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:32,400
this here is the again a dirty sketch

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:35,490
that's a from our desktop client i know

00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,650
it's a bit older but that's the settings

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,990
dialog and the blue ink or the blue

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,020
marker is me and the the red marker is

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,180
our desktop me developer and of course

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,850
we talked a lot like that's not that's

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,790
not captured on the on the board but the

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,679
important thing is that you step away

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,509
from the from the computer

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,779
you talk about it about the technical

00:28:54,509 --> 00:29:00,509
limitations about about the design

00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:02,879
limitations and yeah I mean design

00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:06,119
limitations being the limitation of what

00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:10,649
people can can possibly can possibly

00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:12,179
stomach from one interface and then you

00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:15,570
sit together and make mock-ups discuss

00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:18,570
it and and refine it so yeah we also we

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,039
also erased a lot there and on the

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:24,149
bottom there's like a bunch of other

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:26,279
settings that need to be in and then

00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:29,009
you're at the point where you're kind of

00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,210
thinking well it gets a bit much for

00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:34,619
just me as a person as one designer and

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,350
it's also pretty annoying like all the

00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,389
time juggling the different developer is

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,240
struggling different projects and it

00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:45,629
just simply gets too much so you need to

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,720
build a team that's rule for that's very

00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:52,139
important to to get any like to not get

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,539
burn out for example and to have a to

00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:59,059
have a design team so that you can keep

00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:02,279
the overview of design issues and again

00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:06,509
one of my not anymore so favorite quotes

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,249
is by Nelson 1990 already the

00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:10,440
integration of software cannot be

00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:13,049
achieved by committee where everyone has

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,369
to put in their own additions again it

00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,919
must be controlled by dictatorial

00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:20,909
artists with full say on the final cut

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:24,259
so yeah that's basically the I would say

00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:29,940
the Steve Jobs quote or whatever if you

00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:32,580
sum it up so basically it says that yeah

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,980
you need some design person at the end

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,539
with with a deciding hand on what's

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,799
going in and whatnot right be the

00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:43,590
product manager or or designer yeah but

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:47,309
there has to be some kind of funnel in a

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:50,700
way and I don't necessarily one hundred

00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,769
percent agree with it anymore um in the

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,779
open source world as well as anywhere

00:30:52,769 --> 00:31:02,129
else also because yeah you can't do it

00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:04,769
as one person so this is again inspired

00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:06,000
by ignore me John is the building of a

00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:09,360
design team or

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,700
rather than means of building it is a

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,590
what we used is the the first thing

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,080
that's very important for us as the

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,820
umlaut design teams are our AC channel I

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,440
mean yeah you're you're going to say

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,010
well I receipt channel for designers

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,540
that's kind of not working together but

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,420
again as with the issue tracker it's

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,970
like there's some some sacrifices that

00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,190
you gotta do as a designer working in

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:36,510
open source and I mean there are non

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,910
crappy Ric apps as well and it's just a

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,550
really good method of communication like

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,440
the the two methods of communicate or

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,870
the three methods of communication in

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,170
open source projects are basically issue

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,340
tracker mailing lists and IRC and don't

00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,230
get me started with mailing lists

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,390
they're like totally useless for any

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,880
kind of productive discussion especially

00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,430
on design so we stick to the issue

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,050
tracker as I mentioned before and the

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,420
IRC channel like if we want to quickly

00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,400
communicate on something or if you want

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,860
to let other people know they should

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,560
look at a specific issue that I think is

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,350
really really important and other

00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,430
examples are enemies on the gnome design

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,590
channel is that's what I was inspired by

00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,660
and it's not only for designers that's

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,270
the important point it's not only for

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,040
all the designers of projects it's for

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,840
everyone who wants advice on design as

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,190
well because where are you going to go

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,990
when you want advice on anything

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,700
designer later you're going to go with

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,760
designers are so it's kind of like this

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,310
design roundtable and so I noticed in

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,740
Drupal usability they're only like seven

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,750
people or not people are so so you

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,330
should all get on there and help each

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,340
other out because at least I think

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,700
that's a really really valuable valuable

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,560
resource or valuable channel yeah

00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:57,150
Mozilla doesn't similarly on their on

00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,720
their RC channel UX and they have yeah

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:04,110
similarly have discussions there and

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:07,170
yeah those are like this is three or

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,620
yeah I mean hopefully make it the third

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,150
big one on there but like Mozilla and

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,950
ingrown they do it very well and the

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,050
channels are really cool especially the

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,460
genome is on one there's a bunch of

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,330
people in there i don't know like even

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,830
maybe 100 or something

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:25,870
in a design channel for an open source

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:27,940
project that's pretty cool so it comes

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,190
to design team that's for example the

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,930
the people who are on the design team at

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:39,670
own cloud it's just the a group on

00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:43,480
github basically on our code platform so

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:46,600
that enables us I mean it's useful to

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,250
see who is a designer but you could do

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,470
it with a list as well but the really

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,760
important thing here is or the really

00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,700
really useful thing that I found myself

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,520
using all the time is the functionality

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,010
that you can actually refer this bunch

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,830
of people in an issue I mean it's a good

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,890
up specific thing probably or maybe good

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,900
lab can do similar things or other issue

00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,910
trackers as well but you can mention the

00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,380
whole group I can just say you can only

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:14,670
do that when you're in the group to

00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,590
prevent spam but it's it's super useful

00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:20,170
you can you mention at um 12 designers

00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,180
review please if you need help reviewing

00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:25,060
because we have a 2 reviews review

00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:27,610
process and then people will get

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,800
notified and they can look at it so that

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,650
I find really really useful to know who

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,160
the designers are and and to be able to

00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:39,430
like bat-signal style just call them

00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:45,610
like if you need help you just call the

00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:47,680
the red phone and then yeah we have just

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:51,940
a simple design landing page not that

00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:54,900
beautiful or super awesome yet but we're

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,390
working on that it's it's a very basic

00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:01,110
thing it links to the to the issue list

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:03,880
to the click to the design tagged issues

00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:07,810
list the people being part of the design

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,490
team and some basic guidelines like for

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,070
example like why don't we use bootstrap

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:16,750
right answer a question I've answered

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,220
multiple times and yeah I I guess you

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,590
also needed to answer that at some point

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:25,840
in the past or so Yeah Yeah right so we

00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,270
don't use it and there's reasons you can

00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,280
look it up there and I mean you also

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,080
have that right it's the yeah it's cut

00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,070
off but

00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:39,250
it's a Drupal UX pages I mean there's

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,870
multiple pages I mean you should you

00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,880
should know them if you don't know them

00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,220
I go there they're pretty cool they've

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,850
pretty detailed guidelines like

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,980
forwarding and all this other stuff and

00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:53,400
that's also really interesting because

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:56,860
as I mentioned the genome design wiki I

00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,440
really like that and i oftentimes use it

00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,940
for research like when I when I design

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,410
something new I just go on the global

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,360
design wiki right so i think it's

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,340
immensely important that we in the open

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,260
source community especially we just

00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,550
share this knowledge and we and we use

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,730
the knowledge that the others have

00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,620
published already so i'm probably going

00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,920
to look at that as well and i hope

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:22,480
hopefully we're going to build up a

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:24,220
platform of our own as well so then yeah

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,660
we when you when you when you built that

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:32,230
team there comes to stage 5 where you

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,970
need to go outside and you need to teach

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:38,740
what you learned and share what you

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:43,390
learned so like I said I wrote this

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:45,640
document and I try to do also work with

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,670
other open source projects on making

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,360
making their design better and I give

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:55,800
this talk for example and kind of stuff

00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,530
like that and you also do that um like a

00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,890
blogging basically I mean it's it's

00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:05,170
groups but I have it subscribed in my

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,670
feed reader as like the Drupal design

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,960
blog like what's going on in Drupal

00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:13,720
design and I myself I'm not doing too

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,140
good on the blogging front so I need to

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,270
improve their so it's really cool to see

00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,000
you have a bunch of useful blog posts

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,790
very similar to Mozilla for example

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,100
Mozilla you ax they often blog about

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,900
various topics about crazy research

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,020
stuff like India Firefox OS user

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,150
research stuff like smaller open source

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,190
projects can only dream about but we can

00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,110
learn from it so that's the important

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,870
thing if you have the resource normally

00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:43,020
user research is done in an agency and

00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,349
is not shared with the public so I think

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,970
yeah especially the

00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:50,359
research stuff that bigger projects to

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:54,380
is so important and it's so important to

00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:57,319
publish and read it and then yeah we

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,910
have the HTML CSS guidelines and also

00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,680
design guidelines are very important

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,210
like the wording ones I mentioned before

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,200
and they're all the other ones like

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:08,150
pattern libraries and stuff like that

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,829
because basically what you need to aim

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,979
at when you're a designer you need to

00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:15,229
make yourself obsolete right you need to

00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:17,229
try to imagine what would happen with

00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:21,140
this project if I weren't there anymore

00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:22,940
if I would just decide to cancel or you

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,099
know when the bus factor comes in when

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,259
you're just driven over by a bus what

00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,970
will the project do so you need to

00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:31,880
always aim or at least that's what I do

00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:34,460
I am to make myself obsolete like any to

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,569
do I have any design idea I just

00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,549
directly put it in there it should

00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:40,609
tracker also in the hopes of someone

00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:43,069
else doing it of course but mainly to to

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,140
let other people know what the what the

00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:46,789
what I'm thinking about and what the

00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,059
thought process is to make it more

00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:53,089
transparent and yeah because it also

00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:57,469
invites new people and it's good for the

00:38:53,089 --> 00:39:00,109
whole bunch of reasons and so to that

00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,700
extent you see from the from the

00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:04,880
screenshot i showed you before am

00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,739
sonntag we have a yeah we do have an

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,779
Internet Explorer tagged by the way a

00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:13,249
dedicated one if it's really nice um

00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:15,920
yeah we only have two issues yeah it's

00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:22,819
not a problem we only need to support

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:26,509
Internet Explorer 8 and up soon most

00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:29,690
probably yeah yeah so directly below

00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:32,119
that we have the junior job tag which is

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,920
just a starter tag it's where people

00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,710
where people go if they want to start

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,390
out other issue trackers have similar

00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,059
things you for example you have the

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,309
novice tag so this is what comes up when

00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:45,859
you look for usability in novice that's

00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:47,660
all the starter tags for design right

00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:49,940
and you need to link that very presently

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,369
if that's the correct tags that I chose

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,469
for it right because I'm not sure if

00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:57,499
it's because there's CSS novice HTM L

00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,050
novice and other novice text as well but

00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:02,060
that's probably correct anyway

00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,580
that's super important and i find it

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,950
really helpful to ya always when people

00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,980
come up to you especially designers and

00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,300
they ask you hey I looked at Drupal or I

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,010
looked at home cloud and I want to I

00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,010
want to contribute what should I do and

00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,580
you always have this list of of nice

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,380
issues nice small issues to give them

00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,240
and say hey yeah pick some of that and

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,160
if you need help just let me know so

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,900
you're always prepared for any

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,580
contributor to come in so it's very

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,660
important to keep that list up-to-date

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:35,510
to keep it nice with now not with super

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,310
many instructions but only really put

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,370
the issues in which are handleable

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,690
bye-bye new people so not just put the

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,240
stuff in there that you don't want to do

00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:48,380
because it's just a super much footwork

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:53,290
but really with the cool stuff but small

00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:57,890
parts small CSS fixes or whatnot so

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:59,480
another thing I'm doing or I want to do

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,120
more as well and I heard you're also

00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,220
doing to a certain extent in Drupal is

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,250
working together with design students on

00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,750
may have them work on open source

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,700
software so the the top one hopefully

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,190
the median in German that's the

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:20,300
University in the Stuttgart media

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:22,340
University we're also studied and during

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,460
your studies there was this this project

00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,800
called a user research methods or

00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,990
usability and renew your methods some

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,670
word like that I don't know um now we

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:36,710
all talk about UX so now it's probably

00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:39,590
called UX methods and I noticed so we

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,480
got 12 methods like usability testing

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,520
card sorting and we could choose the

00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,970
project that we won't want it to work on

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,560
ourselves so we could choose anything we

00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:51,410
could choose the University website or

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,500
or whatnot and a lot of people they

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:57,140
actually chose facebook NSN a IM stuff

00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,660
like that like where the reviews are not

00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,270
going to go to facebook or not going to

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,100
go to msn or no one's going to be

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,930
interested anyway and it's going to be a

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,440
piece for the portfolio and nothing more

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:12,260
so i just talked to my professor and a

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,120
stem hey when I'm when I was finished

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,430
hey in the next semester can just come

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,000
over and present like three open source

00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:21,260
projects and just presented own cloud

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,600
media goblin which is like an open

00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,760
source media hosting solution and couch

00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,730
not couchsurfing be welcome which is an

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,310
open source couchsurfing and because i

00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,780
also had ties where I knew the people in

00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:35,300
these projects and just quickly

00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,740
presented them and half of the students

00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,380
actually ended up working on these

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,090
projects and yeah for example the

00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,370
usability testing group worked on hotel

00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,690
and that was really super valuable

00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,780
because especially in open source

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,940
projects you have no time or very little

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,240
time especially if you're one person to

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,790
do proper usability testing but yeah the

00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,830
design students they have time they will

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:00,050
get the right tools and you just also

00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:03,920
sit there and can mentor them and learn

00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:06,620
something as well and the murthe Academy

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,640
as a second thing it's a design academy

00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:13,850
also in stuttgart which were was last

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,550
year for a week where where was just

00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:19,730
working with the students on concepts on

00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:23,390
design concepts and generally working on

00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,950
open source so I went that far that we

00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,500
we introduce them to the issue tracker

00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,060
they did mock-ups they did a concept

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,580
like these things I showed you before

00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,400
the issue discussions and we even had

00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:37,280
some some CSS and JavaScript and HTML

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,830
fix in so during one week I think that's

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,320
that's really cool with students which

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:45,350
had no open source open source

00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,990
experience before that and so yeah I

00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,850
want do more of that if you know

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,730
anything or if you already do that

00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,800
please let's talk about it because I

00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,720
think that really should be a thing open

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,100
source and design students because it

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,190
just really fits kind of perfectly so

00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,090
then we come to the last step on now

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,740
that there is more and more

00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,540
design-focused open source projects I

00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,230
mean especially in recent years with the

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,680
NSA stuff and people being concerned

00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,640
about privacy there's a yeah more and

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,070
more projects more and more

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,050
well-designed projects but then it comes

00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:23,690
to the point where it gets this kind of

00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:25,220
startup vibe all right you you start to

00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,130
get just get the

00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,590
mentality into the open source world but

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,080
you need to collaborate actually let's

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,010
that's rule six you need to integrate

00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,390
and collaborate with other projects and

00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,460
look at how you how you can do it

00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,470
because otherwise you don't have

00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,849
decentralization but it's going to be

00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,250
monopolies after all right you have

00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:48,560
these all these different decentralized

00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,290
instances I mean especially with with

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,570
social networks like there's like how

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,640
many are there 1015 decentralized social

00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:59,869
networks and only a few of them really

00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:03,109
interconnect among or cross across them

00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:04,510
so that's really something that I that I

00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:07,880
don't understand about open source

00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,070
social networks is that they're really

00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,859
monopolies after all so we need to

00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:15,230
really make sure to to collaborate and

00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:18,050
integrate with other projects because

00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:21,140
also that's one of the important one of

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,119
the important points that we have as an

00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,920
advantage over closed source projects

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,290
because closed source projects are way

00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,480
less likely to collaborate with each

00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,790
other or or communicate with each other

00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,820
unless likely even to collaborate with

00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:37,700
with open source projects and so yeah we

00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,859
can link up everything because yeah no

00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,200
one is just using one thing no one is

00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:44,900
just using Apple products they're using

00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,599
websites or web platforms no one is only

00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,119
using Drupal no one is only using own

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,780
cloud no one is only using Firefox right

00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:56,900
so we really need to need to plug them

00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,150
together because yeah the user

00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,760
experience that everyone talks about it

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,720
goes beyond any single project so if

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,520
you're talking about a good user

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,520
experience for a project you need to

00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:12,440
talk beyond one single project and yeah

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:15,290
especially in open source so we have

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,140
some efforts to to to that extent like

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,930
we use web dev caldav in Cardiff as open

00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:23,960
standards for file calendar and and

00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:26,960
contacts sinking so there's a bunch of

00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,980
apps which can already integrate then we

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,260
have some more thoughts and like a

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:34,990
specific share API using like these

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,700
cross cross origin recess sharing

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,640
mechanisms that it's a mechanism that

00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,680
other web

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,960
apps other JavaScript web apps can can

00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:47,670
plug into that side and a whole bunch of

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,790
other stuff which also results in like

00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,950
below the tech talk and it results in

00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,960
stuff like these easy safe to drop box

00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:58,080
and choose from Dropbox buttons you

00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,060
probably saw at some point or sign in

00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:04,200
with Google sign-in with github all this

00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:06,450
stuff so I really think that then open

00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,810
protocols let's again to come back to

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,680
the start as well where SQLite or or

00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:15,720
MySQL the decision really really

00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,820
influences the experience is that when

00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,590
you use an open protocol in the end it's

00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,990
better for the user experience because

00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,520
you can choose the clients you can you

00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,930
can integrate with many more projects

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,750
with less work because they're already

00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:31,980
supporting it so it makes for a better

00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:33,840
user experience so we're for example

00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,640
integrating with chrome online accounts

00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,110
online accounts this great system in

00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,520
Rome where you can just plug in

00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,180
different accounts you can of course

00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,640
also plug in Facebook and Google and

00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,760
Yahoo and it will sync calendar contacts

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,020
files and all these different things and

00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,610
that's for example a really awesome

00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:56,840
effort by beg gnome and yeah I mean now

00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:59,940
there's there's also other systems doing

00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,680
but but really that's a very one of the

00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,190
most polished solutions I've seen like

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,560
anywhere not only in open source and

00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:10,650
also for a mail pile okay that's again

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,090
cut off sorry but mail pile is an open

00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:15,630
source email app which is focused on

00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:17,730
bringing usable encrypted email and they

00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,130
also have this thread about a possible

00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,350
own cloud plug-in where you can pick

00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,880
files for example right you could could

00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:26,790
pick attachments or you could save

00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,060
attachments to your own cloud and that's

00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:32,310
I think yeah it's a way better than

00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,570
trying to build everything yourself not

00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,890
integrated with anything else because

00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:37,170
then we're going to end up with all

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:40,410
these separate apps again and that's

00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:43,410
kind of not the point and there's a

00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,390
whole bunch of other initiatives I'm not

00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,070
going to go super deep into that there's

00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:50,070
the call open source design is pretty

00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,660
cool a lot of blog posts then there's a

00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,480
github group that we're doing open

00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,500
source designers

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,750
so I'm going to add you folks to it it's

00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,609
just a loose organization and we're

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,800
trying to put some resources some

00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:05,830
patterns some useful blog posts and just

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,670
get some kind of organization in it or

00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:11,980
try to communicate more I mean yeah at

00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,720
least or already like being at this

00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,210
conference is very interesting like

00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,510
exchanging with you how you do design

00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,770
and I think that's very important

00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,300
there's also a bunch of conferences

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,190
going on this was already in the past

00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,580
but it was I still mention it because it

00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,960
was it was mainly like many technology

00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,630
people coming but it was also very

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,030
design focused in a way that people

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,340
should collaborate and that that we

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:38,950
shared ideas a lot it was it was a bar

00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,020
camp style organization at the own cloud

00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,210
contributor conference last year we also

00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:46,359
invited some some people from other

00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,710
projects which are similar then there's

00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,060
an upcoming conference in Nuremberg

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:53,530
which is very similar to the

00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:55,359
decentralized camp and there's a an

00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,550
awesome thing going on and we want to

00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,070
organize a for fuzz down you probably

00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:04,030
all know falls down the free and open

00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:05,590
source developers European meeting open

00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,950
source people have a have a thing for

00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:12,310
abbreviations I hate that but it's huge

00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,660
European open source conference you

00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,090
probably know about it but we're

00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,609
organizing a design dev room for it so a

00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:21,310
whole track for open source designers

00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:23,230
and we're pulling a whole bunch of

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,050
people and so if you don't know about it

00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:28,960
yet please talk to me and attend or mean

00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,990
we will know tomorrow if it will be

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,790
accepted because more is the

00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:37,300
announcement deadline and then we'll see

00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:39,670
if we all meet at foss then and yeah of

00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,100
course you thanks again for inviting me

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,320
because yeah I think it's really really

00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,630
important to exchange to have this this

00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,530
exchange between the open source project

00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:52,270
and I think in the end everything is

00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:55,690
pretty much awesome and it's going going

00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:58,510
in a really good direction and if you've

00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,950
not seen the lego movie so far you

00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,290
should definitely do it because it's

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,700
it's the best movie this year I would

00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:09,290
say

00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:12,200
maybe even this decade so yeah to sum it

00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,970
up the first obvious rule design it well

00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,890
if you're just alone and if you're not

00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,260
even a designer try to design it well

00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,810
try to redesign blog posts and stuff try

00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:23,150
to look up the what other projects are

00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:26,210
doing there's a lot of resources out

00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,740
there as I present then try to build a

00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:30,890
design culture in your own project if

00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,720
you're a sole designer or if you're not

00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:37,340
even a designer right it goes for anyone

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,590
and then make sure that you're also yeah

00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,630
go into the trenches and do the actual

00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:44,240
work because that will that will make

00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:47,090
you credible and yeah give you a design

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,950
street cred among developers then you

00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,440
need to build a team to make it feasible

00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,870
for yourself and to not die of

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,240
exhaustion and then you need to teach

00:51:53,870 --> 00:52:00,500
and share and get even more people in

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,670
some students or other people and then

00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,620
you need to work together with other

00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:05,300
projects I mean you probably should even

00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,210
work together with other project at an

00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:12,230
earlier stage it's it's it's parallel

00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:15,640
not steps after each other and that's

00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,640
pretty much it thank you

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,080
you know questions

00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,650
hey am I really like to hear some tips

00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,870
from you about em how to encourage

00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:50,100
developers to also get involved in the

00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:53,040
design process because I think it's

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:58,050
really interesting yeah so that's

00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:00,180
basically what the the design culture

00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,430
thing is about right you when you when

00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,610
you communicated in a way that it's

00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:08,670
that's in the issue tracker or in the on

00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:10,530
the developers turf so to say people are

00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:13,440
going to get involved with it sooner or

00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:15,030
later people see or developers see that

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,510
there's design activity going on and

00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:20,070
there's I mean they will also be need to

00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:22,560
be involved in it anyway because

00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,630
oftentimes designer or most of the time

00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:29,540
design and development decisions they

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:32,190
overlap so at a certain point it just

00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,320
when you when you also do it enough and

00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:37,830
when you talk to the developers they

00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:41,520
will get involved eventually I mean when

00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:43,830
you use all the the methods and when you

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,540
like I really really think this this icy

00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,430
channel thing for example is really good

00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,400
two to get people kind of sucked in and

00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:53,960
two I mean if you just if you just are

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,700
idling in the channel and just you you

00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,960
notice the discussions and you can just

00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,300
read through what the designers talk

00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,100
about it's also something that as a

00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,100
developer I guess helps get you started

00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:09,420
thanks I already we already spoke about

00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:12,210
this last night i think but just in case

00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:15,270
I remember is curious and how what

00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:19,170
percentage of contributors to own cloud

00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:22,430
or paid contributors right so um it's a

00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:26,850
good question I mean code contributors

00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:30,000
so there's I think 10 full-time or 15

00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:33,080
full-time contributors and there's I

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,020
think every month or two hundred

00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:40,530
contributors or 300 I don't have the

00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:43,140
exact number but yeah that's around the

00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,420
listen I mean of course the the paid

00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,970
contributors can do it full time so they

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:52,190
can be a bit more focused on it but yeah

00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:53,970
in general it's a it's from the from the

00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:57,090
people working on it

00:54:53,970 --> 00:55:01,590
is way more volunteers working on and

00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:16,730
then paid thanks does anyone else have

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:18,840
any questions so I think the biggest the

00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,220
there's a lot of really good stuff in

00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,599
here I think the one that I take the

00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,930
most issue with is the idea that

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,560
designers need to code in order to gain

00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:32,040
street cred with the developers I know

00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:34,530
that there are many of us specifically

00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,990
who work in Drupal who we're not really

00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,790
coders and we're not going to be um but

00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:41,760
we know how to talk to the coders and we

00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:43,890
know how to communicate our dr ideas

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,320
effectively in order to get the

00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,510
developers on our side so i would

00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,030
probably amend number three to say you

00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,710
have to be able to speak the language of

00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,410
the people who have to actually

00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:58,530
implement what you're designing yeah um

00:55:55,410 --> 00:56:00,810
there are a number of designers I see

00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:02,490
who you know want to sort of charge in

00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:04,080
and rant and change things and I

00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,990
certainly count myself as one of those

00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,280
designers back in two thousand nine or

00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:12,180
whatever it was when I joined the

00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:16,109
community yeah oh man well you know I go

00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:21,089
on rampages um but I think the big thing

00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:23,430
in any community of this size where so

00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:26,940
many people are putting in their off

00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:29,520
hours in most cases just to make this

00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,900
product better is sort of respecting

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,270
that all of us are doing this in every

00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,330
time and I think that's a big sort of

00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:41,430
message from all of this right so yeah I

00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:43,470
probably need to like reduce it a bit or

00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:46,349
the point makes a point a bit more clear

00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:48,089
that in that it's really i mean the

00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,800
intention is that you can speak the

00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:51,089
language of the developers and you're on

00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,710
the same page and you know what it's

00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:57,240
possible and I think it also varies

00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,859
between the projects right if you if you

00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:03,440
have a project like drupal a big one

00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:06,930
then it really isn't possible 22 yeah

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:09,329
for every designer to be a coder as well

00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:11,250
for a smaller project it's definitely

00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:13,890
possible i would say or its necessary

00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,780
evil but yeah that's a very good point

00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,119
yeah well and i also think that one of

00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,670
the things that you demonstrated very

00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,710
well there and i really liked the way

00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:27,200
that you guys have it set up a known in

00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:30,000
own cloud is just the way that you show

00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,559
design issues evolved in the above in

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,809
the bug tracker i think there's a lot

00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,250
that we in the drupal project can take

00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:37,859
from that I think there's bits and

00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,450
pieces of what we're trying to do but I

00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:41,819
think we could probably refine that

00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:44,250
process as we move forward and continue

00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:46,589
building a design culture within Drupal

00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:53,099
so thank you very much for demonstrating

00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:56,250
that thank you any other questions or

00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,869
remarks or if no one else has any

00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:00,690
questions I just wanted to say that I'm

00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:02,390
i asked yan to come speed because i

00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,170
think it's really important to get and

00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,900
perspective outside the Drupal community

00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:09,119
and you know get new insight and new

00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,069
ideas and then that's really hard to do

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,799
as a track chair because you can't

00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:16,020
afford to compensate and because the DA

00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:19,680
doesn't the DA doesn't give you any

00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:22,049
might do that um so I got a lot of rude

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,760
responses and a lot of don't you know

00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:25,740
who I am kind of stuff like that but yon

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,049
was so humble and he was so enthusiastic

00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,430
about coming and sharing and you know

00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:31,920
collaborating with the community that I

00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:33,059
thought it was just awesome and he paid

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,990
you know you paid his own train to get

00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,089
here and he's staying on a friend's

00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,410
couch or something like that and to be

00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:39,540
here so I just thought if you see him

00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,500
around just a just buy me a drink or

00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,599

00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,650

00:59:07,099 --> 01:00:01,059
