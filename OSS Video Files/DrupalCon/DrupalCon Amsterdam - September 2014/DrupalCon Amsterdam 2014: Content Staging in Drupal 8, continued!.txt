Publication date: 2014-10-01
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: dixon_
By popular request: This is a follow-up session from Content Staging in Drupal 8 that was presented in Austin.

Drupal 8 has made significant improvements towards the ability to stage configuration. But what about content staging? Has it gotten easier in Drupal 8?

This session is targeted towards site builders where we will continue to explore the content staging solution that is being built for Drupal 8 and that was initially presented in Austin. It's a solution that brings vast improvements to sites owners that need to stage or replicate content across sites.

Further, site builders will learn how this solution also applies to broader and sometimes more exciting use cases - content sharing and filtered replication across networks of sites and applications.

And for the first time, a demo will be presented on the following scenarios:

Traditional content staging
Editorial hub powering a network of light front-end sites
Bi-directional (!) content replication between different Drupal sites


This session will also be a great introduction to the topic for anyone interested in joining the Content Staging in Drupal 8 sprint that the presenter is hosting during the sprint days! Sign up on the sprint spreadsheet.
