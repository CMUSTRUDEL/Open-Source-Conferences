Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Drupal 8 Contrib Module Update
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: SchnitzeldasjoaspiliciousDave Reiddrunken monkeymiro_dietikerquicksketchbojanzBerdirjaperry
Drupal 8 is on its way and you are a maintainer of one of the most used Drupal module. In the Site Building track we plan to organize a "Drupal 8 Contrib Module Status Session", which gives all the maintainers of famous module a possibility to tell everybody about their status of the Module.

This session will take 2 1/4h and will include 12 minute sessions of all the maintainers. Where every maintainer will present the status of their module for Drupal 8 in the same way (plans and changes for D8, current status, help & possibilities to contribute). The idea is to give site builders a concentrated overview of the status for the most important modules they need to build Drupal 8 sites.

These Modules will be presented:

Webform (by quicksketch)
Rules (by dasjo)
Display Suite (by aspilicious)
Media (by daveried/slashrsm)
Search API (by drunken monkey)
Commerce (by bojanz)
Redirect, Global Redirect, Token, Pathauto (by berdir)
Panels (by japerry)
Simplenews (by miro_dietiker/ifux)

hello hope you had some good lunch and

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,090
ready for the next two presentations

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,759
actually so the next thing we'll do is a

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,560
bit a special thing it's it's kind of an

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,869
experiment it's kind of an idea that we

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,789
had in the track chairs so I'm the track

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,460
chair of site building and case studies

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,800
for drupalcon Amsterdam so together with

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,099
my colleagues of the other tracks we

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,050
decided like em which sessions that will

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,660
actually present and I can tell you it's

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,540
super hard because we get 10 times more

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,750
session submissions that we actually

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,920
have slots so what we already knew from

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,649
the beginning is that there will be a

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,629
lot of modules about triple eight

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,250
contrib modules because all the

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,770
maintainer they're heavily working

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,440
already on porting their modules so we

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,969
said okay let's put it down and beside

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,370
of like actually using a lot of spaces

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,829
we do one session which is a double

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,379
session which is the country of status

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,539
update so what is what will happen

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,850
exactly because it cannot have everybody

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,350
present at the same time so we have

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,360
eight presenters and they're actually

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,670
the module maintained errs so we didn't

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,830
spare any time to contact olive to find

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,299
the time they're all have time during

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,250
routed through pecan I can tell you

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,799
that's super hard so they're all sitting

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,470
here now which is super cool and they

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,140
will present us some of the most used

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,380
modules we have eight module 11 modules

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,880
and the most used current through / 7

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,100
modules so they most probably will also

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,040
be really heavy used to palade modules

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,020
and they will tell about the status each

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,810
of them will take 12 minutes so it's

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,850
really short and it's about what is the

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,100
plan for Drupal 8 are there any changes

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,560
or the adaptions what is the current

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,810
status and of course we're an open

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,790
source community so is there anything

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,930
that you can help there are a lot of

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,420
different modules they have different

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,909
ideas what they need so they will tell

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,920
you how they need help there is a short

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,200
Q&A we have two microphones left and

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,540
right and so if you have a question

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,009
please get up and walk there so we have

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,350
it on audio and we don't lose too much

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,289
time and we have like three to four

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,330
minutes of Q&A per module if they're bit

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,290
faster we have even more so if you have

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,959
a question

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,700
ask it if it's way too long the people

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,629
will be here all week so you can ask

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,230
them later and you can discuss that

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:27,629
there will be a 15-minute break so

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,049
because I said it's a to a double

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,909
session so we do some break and you will

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,500
get the fall update on Drupal 8 country

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,900
so if you walk out here you will know

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,590
which model is were ready and when you

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,920
can start build your Drupal sites so we

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,870
start with the first one that's Drupal 8

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,419
rules and we'll the presentation will be

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,750
done by yourself and we need to change

00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,750
that

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:09,249
cool so hello everybody this

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,599
presentation is about rules in Drupal 8

00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:16,090
and I'm not really the maintainer of the

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,790
rules module nor i'm the creator but we

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,709
are a whole team so far go he is the

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,019
Rose creator there is Klaus iam the team

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,549
which the container we have Nico green

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,659
our who provides design and I'm

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,939
responsible for all the other stuff what

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:34,209
is the rules module so we have a new

00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:36,879
logo and we like it because we can

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,370
create custom Oh custom workflows based

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,739
on events conditions and actions so it's

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,079
very util for example to send customized

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,939
emails that the site builders connect

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,250
can actually go into the site and

00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,159
configure small workflows or even set a

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,829
bigger workflows like redirection system

00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,650
messages breadcrumbs it's very util and

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,989
it has a lot of integration so it's

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,879
based on the entity API it integrates

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,909
with the whole troop of commerce

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,909
ecosystem buspar corporations for

00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:10,659
example and this is because of a great

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,400
architecture so the entities they expose

00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:14,799
the metadata that the rules module them

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,599
can interact with which you see the

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,919
provider / to / corrib or any other

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:22,780
module and the success that we have seen

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,570
makes it happen that it's used on every

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,090
5th rupal site so more than 250,000

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,150
installations we have hundreds of

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:35,199
integration modules available and this

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:38,440
is just a few examples of them so yeah

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,720
this is rules from Drupal 5 basically to

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,940
Drupal 7 and it has been a great success

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,530
story and then there was always the big

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,750
question mark what we're going to do for

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,400
Drupal 8 because they're maintained errs

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,889
they are pretty busy working on Drupal

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,800
core running their own companies and

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,560
lots of other stuff so our predictions

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,870
were like it's going to be hard but we

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,969
have lots of great ideas so what you can

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,150
expect for rules in Drupal 8 under the

00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:06,009
hood is is all the best practices that

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,370
you can see in jubilate like evolved

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,349
developer experience object orientation

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,250
all the new pattern service orientated

00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:17,320
architecture architecture and so on it's

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,450
obviously based on the plug-in system

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,630
under on the Drupal 8 plug-in system now

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,480
and it's based on entities and the new

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,040
type data thing that you you will all

00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,750
deal with in Drupal 8 as a developer and

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,530
another great thing for the developers

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,110
or even for administrators will be we

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,420
will be able to deploy configuration or

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,760
the rules configuration via the

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,920
configuration management initiative y SE

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:51,040
mi so that made us all like it like

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,960
looking forward to it and we also want

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,240
to like the whole idea about getting off

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,180
the island is also integrating better

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,940
with other systems so we want to provide

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,100
more reusable components and work with

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,500
the others in the community for example

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,230
the context API should be shared with

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,710
Drupal core and page manager so that we

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:15,180
do not have contextual systems

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:19,150
duplicated but we combine the efforts

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,800
also tokens we have to provide tokens of

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,990
course and they will be similar to

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,610
entity tokens in Drupal 7 so they are

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,470
automatically exposed wire the type data

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,020
then if you are not working with fields

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,060
but you want to have widgets for any

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,680
data and format this for any data you

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,340
can use the type data which it's

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,130
informative and then finally the whole

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,510
rules UI components they should be we

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,750
should be able to integrate them

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:50,230
separately so we can have actions and

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,370
conditions or the rules data selector so

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,710
when we talk about actions and

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,140
conditions I could for example extends

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,870
the block configuration user interface

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,270
and add the possibility to add

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,130
conditions in the blocks you I so we

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,530
could decide the liquid just go into the

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,070
blocks UI and do like page manager

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,340
selection rules based on the rules UI

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,910
components so that we feel like that

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,790
would be cool and the data selector as

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,440
you know it in rupal 7 wouldn't it be

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,270
nice to use it like for example for

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,590
tokens or just any other system in

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,600
Drupal it doesn't really have to be

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,760
tight or a dependency of the rules

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,240
module so cool finally not all of us are

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,830
in Turkey

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,590
morning so the site builders what can

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,300
they expect so the administrative user

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,400
interface should be all should all

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,180
leverage the best practices and to pet

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,500
the UI patterns that we have in Drupal 8

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,599
there's views by corporations in a

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,569
simplified version in course we can also

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:53,860
leverage that to execute rose actions or

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:56,169
Rose components and finally I'm very

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,139
fascinated about this idea we don't know

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,449
how it will look like in the UI but will

00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,960
basically get rid of the rules

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:08,289
conditional rule set all of the

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,110
complicated stuff and just allow to nest

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,080
rules in inside the other so in line

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:21,280
rules will allow us to build stuff more

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:23,979
in a more efficient way yeah so can we

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,470
have it now we thought it would be nice

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,240
to have it now or as early as possible

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,490
and this is why we came up with the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,700
whole idea how can we do fundraising so

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,140
we did a Kickstarter like campaign on

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:41,320
Drupal funders and we also did corporate

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,740
funding and now basically as you can see

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,510
on the slide we have basically finance

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,000
to the first milestone so the whole

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:53,890
project is budgeted for 1,000 of hours

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,770
of work and we have sponsors and the

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,120
community Fonda's do that and we were

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:05,410
pretty successful at that so we raised

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:08,980
in total about 18,000 years but to go to

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:12,670
the very end we need 48,000 in total so

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,940
it's still a long way to go and how did

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:18,490
we do that well we we were happy to find

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,450
all these companies on support us and we

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,329
are still looking for more and we did so

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,399
while the group of funders campaign we

00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:32,020
produced some cool rulers that you still

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:34,209
can get and we also run sprints on

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,510
various events in order to already get

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:39,279
coding so we're not just trying to get

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,540
funds but we also spending the muddy

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,100
money already and we are developing all

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,010
on github using the poor

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,960
request workflows so it's all shiny and

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,810
the very cool experience for new

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,520
contributors you can join us on the

00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:01,060
sprints so the current development focus

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,520
is on porting actions so this is great

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,460
for newcomers because it's like very

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,040
individual tasks that allow you to get

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,620
into the system but you do not have to

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,960
be an expert at all on the other hand we

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,820
are working on Drupal 8 core integration

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,960
for the context system and basically

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:22,300
finishing the whole milestone one as an

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,180
overview my son one is almost done and

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,820
it has also been funded and we are still

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,280
looking for funds to complete my systems

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,050
two and three but we mainly focus on

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,610
development right now because we don't

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,880
want always to ask for money without

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,830
doing something so my stump you should

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,390
be finished by the end of the year if we

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,360
get the funds if not it's probably

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,010
delayed and then by the beginning of the

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,670
next year we should be able to ship the

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:52,300
whole rules module at least until Drupal

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,250
8 is going to be shipped yeah that's

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,030
like the status update from my side um

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,770
you can meet us at 1pm on Thursday for

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,720
an extended bath where you can answer

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,630
even more questions but i'm very happy

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,330
to take some right now and there's also

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,750
be a whole sprint day on friday where we

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,310
focus on porting the actions and fixing

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,650
all the stuff that is left for my stone

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:20,520
one and would be happy to get all of you

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,520
developers or just any feedback yeah

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:34,010
so do you have any questions about rules

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:48,380
no I got one we will be translatable out

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:48,380
of the box like messages and stuff well

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,850
okay so because we use cmi we can also

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,910
transferred in yay evil reasonable

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,590
content okay cool em so if somebody

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,980
wants to support you with money who

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,870
should they contact so basically you go

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,090
to the DA trolls website and we have a

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,890
contact formula where you're just fill

00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,690
in all your data and we will get back to

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,340
you as soon as possible to get the money

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:24,990
yeah or just hit me up on the way under

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,340
conference we we have produced for the

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,780
for the Kickstarter campaign we have

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,620
produced those rulers and they were

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,660
really popular so if you have donated to

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,430
the project and haven't received your

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,610
ruler yet please come to me and I will

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,680
make sure that your surf and one ruler

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,160
basically is one hour of development so

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,380
the agency's apical and genomics agreed

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,050
on 45 years per hour which is basically

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,820
them covering the self cost in Vienna so

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,370
they are not making any money anymore

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,470
but they allow the developers Fargo and

00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,240
Klaus II who are like top developers to

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,640
work on the on on the edge rules port in

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,140
the company time so if you want to fund

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,450
an hour of da draws work you can get the

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,730
ruler for 50 euro which basically

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,400
includes the ruler plus the one hour of

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,170
work cool yes and I think like rules is

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,330
a bit a special case because a lot of

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,900
other modules depending on it so that's

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,790
why so if you for example cannot decide

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,230
about money in your company but go to

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,420
the DA drools there's a really cool

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,300
video where people a lot of module other

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,520
modules maintainer explain why they need

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,040
rules to run their own modules and

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,620
that's why I also malam rules is really

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,940
important to be early finished so to be

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,470
before we actually add

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,170
no do you plan on a real release

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:47,400
candidate as well like Wendy 8 has a

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,990
release candidate or so yeah we have not

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,920
really talked about release candidates

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,960
um but so it will do it's just really

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,430
good to have it already out before like

00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,400
other modules start using it because

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,410
they depend on it so yeah in order so

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,960
because if rules would not be ported

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,550
early then we would not have the others

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,100
the other models would have to wait with

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,350
their integrations and we really want to

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,360
fix that and for example we also have

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,770
ideas around Symphony event so little

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,250
that could that could really be

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,590
important for for the whole ecosystem

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,290
when they are possible to integrate food

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,600
events and all that stuff in an easy way

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:27,720
as early as possible okay good if there

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,580
no more question to ask questions thank

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,580
you Yosef and we go to the next one

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:49,470
there are some stickers so the next

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:52,500
module is panels checkup hello right

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,600
okay so sort of intimidating coming

00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,510
after rules because we are way less

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,970
prepared so panels combined forces for

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,750
good so panels as we as some of you may

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:09,090
know is a fairly monolithic module and

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,830
it comes with seat well doesn't come

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,190
with but depends on CTools another

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,340
somewhat monolithic module and the

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,330
process basically is to get rid of that

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,060
and make panels do what it does well and

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,310
have it not do anything else and so one

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,040
of those are a few of those issues here

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:32,339
we're working on page manager by Tim

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,339
Plunkett basically page manager being

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:38,400
moved out of panels and then it's all

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,630
going to go into this own module so as

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,050
soon as that modules out we'll be

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,790
building on top of that there was

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,430
discussion about what's going to happen

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,910
with the layout module so display sweet

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,699
and other display modules using layouts

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,209
are going to be

00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:57,459
be needing to combine forces and that's

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,220
sort of what we want to do because right

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:03,429
now we have our own layouts in panels d7

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,579
and we want to change that so it's right

00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:09,579
now in contribs and I think you'll stay

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:11,290
that way for a while so we need to get

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,559
that done and then we're looking at

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,309
using frege's layout plugin which will

00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,910
use to power panels and then we're

00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:23,679
working on the remaining ctools features

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:27,429
with any luck seatools would no longer

00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:30,429
exist in v8 but we'll see we've ripped

00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:35,019
out a lot but there is a lot in there so

00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:38,049
we'll see so a few things that we the

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,629
the main process right now is we need to

00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:42,699
get a layout variant and actually this

00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,609
was David's know Peck has been doing a

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:47,759
lot of work in this arena and he's been

00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:52,389
doing a lot basically most the porting

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:58,660
on the panel side so he's made a panels

00:16:52,389 --> 00:17:00,639
layout variant and it worked and then d8

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,039
sort of upgraded itself a little bit and

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,350
now it doesn't work but we're working on

00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,299
fixing it up so we did have a proof of

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,389
concept and that part is like you know

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,919
at the eighty-five percent side once

00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:13,659
that's done we're going to work on

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,209
implementing a style plugin so these are

00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:19,389
the two major components of panels and

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,760
then lastly work on a migration path so

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:25,000
you can go from the d7 panels page

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,250
manager into da as far as everything

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,120
else in panels we're trying to keep it

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,090
as similar to d7 as far as what the end

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,549
user sees so you're not going to see a

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,120
whole lot of new features probably from

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:43,059
panels quite yet the big goal again is

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,970
to try to offload everything like use

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:48,279
the core context system and everything

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,210
else that core is now providing we want

00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:54,100
to get out of panels and see tools so

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,769
like I said this palace Lee house

00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,490
someone had have kittens do they work

00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:03,340
yeah it did but it doesn't at the moment

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,870
however you can join us and try to help

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,420
us

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,480
drupal scotch we're in there pretty much

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,000
all the time and if you ping David

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,760
myself Tim Plunkett you'll probably get

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,410
response Oh Eclipse GC so crisp and

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,020
water has also been doing a bunch of

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,790
work on this it was a few others that I

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,580
don't have to top up top of my head but

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,850
we also have a weekly update meeting we

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,880
do in IRC right now we're looking for a

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,640
better meeting time so if you sign up on

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,250
there on the doodle I believe that's

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,950
also in the Scotch channel come join us

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,860
because unlike some other modules we're

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,570
still pretty preliminary in where we're

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,120
going here with panels and then of

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,160
course the issue queue will be working

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,960
on basically all the the style plug-in

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,429
and the layout plug-in will be in there

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,580
as meta issues and then we'll go through

00:18:51,429 --> 00:19:01,570
the various parts there so that's about

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:07,960
it for panels any questions all right

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:10,030
that one I want to open yes and there

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,460
are a lot of modules around panels that

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,220
like add additional features like

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,420
penalize or panels everywhere and are

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,910
there any plans in that area so I not I

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,650
don't know how they're doing on those

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,650
people but all I know is that we're not

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:31,150
right now planning to bring it in two

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:33,040
panels we at least right now the idea is

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,290
to be really a straight port because we

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,570
want to get panels out as soon as

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,100
possible and we feel like you know the

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,290
more things we add to it the product

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,510
longer it would take okay and for the

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,309
people which like I tried patron natural

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,679
or the app and it's and it looks kind of

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,960
already like panel so we'll then panels

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,820
depend on page manager correct and from

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,220
the UI what else will it bring because

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,660
there is already quite a lot of stuff so

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,200
you'll bring like the display variants

00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,210
the the rule selections not like rules

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,610
but basically trying to figure out the

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,840
different ways to display your content

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,630
so that's the part that will go on top

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,270
of page manager cool good okay I think I

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,760
see one more yeah there is yeah I have a

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:15,010
question yeah you you almost get the

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,330
answer but still I'd like to answer the

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:21,980
question usability

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:26,090
I can I know it has to be built has to

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,480
be changed but what do you need to make

00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,220
it happen to make better usability

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,780
experience for the annals module so

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,300
that's a great question as in the panels

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,570
the d7 panels this morning and you know

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:45,410
it admittedly is a pretty horrible you I

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,630
but it's very powerful there has been

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,840
talk but we haven't we don't have any

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:54,830
funding yet to work on panels so it's

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:58,190
pretty much take the g7 version d8 make

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,810
it d 8 so I'm hoping that some that

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,270
there'll be work in that realm and we

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:05,210
could totally use volunteers or other

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,010
help in that in that spot so I think

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,780
hopefully I know it's not the answer you

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,140
want here but I love to give you the

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:15,770
better one I yeah is there something

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:22,370
like spark for Jubilee yeah so the spark

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:24,380
initiative it's going and panels is not

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,970
really a part of me a sort of apartment

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,600
but not we haven't really been working

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:33,080
on too much so my guess is that as d8

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,380
matures there will be more initiative

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,710
from those resources to help work on the

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,990
UX components and potentially family

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,430
part of that okay so we not only need

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,710
coders if you are interested in the

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,980
usability also talk to the guy these

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,350
guys because palaces use a lot and I can

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,670
say from my own experience that like for

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,680
people which never use it before it's

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,840
really hard but it's super powerful so

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,640
if you're interested in helping yeah

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,600
definitely talk to the guys and find

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,510
them around yep I'm there's a few of us

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,230
around but most of the d8 people are not

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:12,140
here but if you find Chris myself I

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,390
don't think Damien McKenna's here but

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,130
yeah if I neither want em tam ISM here

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,660
so finding either one of us and we can

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,610
sort of help steer in the right

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,610
direction so thanks cool thank you

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:41,720
next one up is MIA so we have to even

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:45,080
yes thank you being here all right hi

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,660
everyone my name is Dave Reed and I me

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,550
honest and we're going to give a quick

00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,970
update on what's happening in the state

00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:55,010
of Drupal 8 media and i want to say

00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:00,500
panels you're not alone in this

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:02,030
situation so yeah i mean everyone kind

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,179
of is pretty familiar with drupal 8

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,980
media the media module it's great but

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:10,070
there's been a lot of like minor issues

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,050
or major issues wysiwyg integration

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,420
maybe doesn't work properly sometimes or

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,840
all the time so we want to make sure

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:20,809
that we really look forward going into

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,850
Drupal 8 fixing these issues from the

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,550
ground up not really porting but

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,530
rewriting from scratch especially since

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,059
we had other modules likes called come

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,800
in the picture that provided an

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,660
alternate viewpoint on how to do things

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,370
and we want to make sure that we

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,620
collaborated wit collaborated with those

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,010
teams too so that's kind of where our

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,360
vision is going and we're kind of

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,340
joining forces with these teams and

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,350
working on some common components and

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:51,830
what can I go through these components

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:53,420
with you right now yeah so first

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:57,679
component component that we're working

00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:01,400
on is called entity browser it's if you

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:05,000
are familiar with media and how the

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,210
widget for selecting and uploading media

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,670
works in seven it's similar but it's

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:15,020
made in a more general way so it can be

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:20,210
used with any entity type and it's more

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:22,070
pluggable so it's more extensible so and

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,290
can be used in different contexts it's

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,020
not suitable only for media but you can

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,360
use it just to to power and enter it

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,460
entity reference field four nodes and

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,650
bring in related articles and stuff like

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,470
that

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:39,140
entity browser is still in very early

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:43,630
stage of development so we can only show

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:47,120
a mock but if you go to the project page

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,420
there are a few issues open and there is

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,280
a also discussion about architecture

00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:01,570
where we go more into detail and you're

00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:05,300
invited to join us second component is

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:08,450
one of two storage components that were

00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:13,580
planning to build its cool called media

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:17,170
entity and if you are familiar with file

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:20,360
entity in in the seven it works in a

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:24,950
different way it works similar to how

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:28,070
scowl works it doesn't use files for

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:32,060
everything instead of that it creates a

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,950
new entity type that is then used to

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:42,170
actually store your media and as a

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:46,280
result of that it's not necesarily it's

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:48,920
not necessary to store everything in far

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,470
managed table it kept works heavily with

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,980
fields you basically the idea behind

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:57,800
this that you store everything is like

00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,940
standard few the API fields and then you

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,300
have plugins that that provide you some

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:10,580
business logic or validation or metadata

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:14,270
that that works with your media type

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:18,080
let's say you have a youtube video you

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:20,840
you you just use text field where you

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,590
can paste URL in and then you have a

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,500
player plugin that validates this and it

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,810
provides you a no tags description that

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,550
can be fetched from YouTube API and

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:37,310
things like that and it's it's basically

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,730
already working this so you can try to

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,800
contest it and there is an example

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,100
plugin for YouTube videos that you could

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,530
look into

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:52,200
and they would it so another kind of

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,400
major component the entity browser that

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,870
was mentioned before it's kind of like

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,210
one of our big parts that we're

00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,350
collaborating on the embedding portion

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,030
is the other big part that we're

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,230
collaborating on so this is like where

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,880
you actually put something in your

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,460
WYSIWYG this is like we want to make

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,860
sure we get this nailed down right and

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,390
I'm really happy to say that we're we

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,150
started this new project called entity

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,549
in bed and we had a really great summer

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,460
a code student and as evidenced by me

00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,020
wearing my Summer of Code shirt today

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,950
who worked on this all summer and did a

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,630
really fantastic job and so like we're

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,059
solving all these kind of embedding

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,299
problems and there it's going so well

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,429
and this is pretty much almost complete

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,020
so you can have different you can have

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,080
multiple buttons one for embedding

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,610
content one for embedding files one for

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,460
embedding users if you want to do that

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,169
so you can have multiple buttons it

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,100
works for all those entity types out of

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,539
the box with no additional code and the

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,059
really cool thing is that it kind of

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,260
reuses the concept of field for matters

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:56,850
that were introduced in Drupal 7 so for

00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,880
instance if you're embedding a file or

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,850
an image you can reuse file and image

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,230
for matters to display your output so

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,559
like here in our screenshot this is an

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,270
image a field for matter it's not

00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:12,419
necessarily attached to a field it's

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,830
just it's a file empty and you can pick

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,659
how you on display it and provide

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,059
options and actually provide alternate

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,520
and title text to the right there in the

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:23,340
screen and it all just works all

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,400
together and then once you submit this

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:31,020
form it's all serialized into one HTML

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,929
attribute the uses data attributes html5

00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,299
attributes so it's all encapsulated in

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,309
one nice HTML tag doesn't use special

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,600
markup doesn't use special tokens it

00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:44,250
just uses HTML and works and the other

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,190
cool thing is that as also supports you

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,860
you IDs like under the box if you've

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,350
selected an entity it makes sure to

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,450
embed the uuid of that entity in the

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,890
HTML tag so that when you deploy your

00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,220
site to production or something

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:02,500
won't and if your entity IDs change but

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,890
your UI unique IDs should not change

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,540
it'll still keep working out of the box

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,790
so this is a great one to check out I

00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,010
know some people are actually just using

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,750
this module in production sites and use

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:17,260
on Drupal 8 right now they're crazy but

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,600
I love them so this is totally usable

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,120
right now it only just maybe breaks when

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,900
Drupal 8 updates that's all but we're

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,300
doing our best to keep it up to date

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,310
yeah shandon this is our google Summer

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,280
code student so he deserves like Reddit

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,100
I'm ecs on this course shadow and if you

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,770
see him on IRC say hi yeah it's done a

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,440
really great job and so kind of after we

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,560
developed this empty in bed module we

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,450
kind of I kind of realized that a lot of

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,950
the stuff that we're doing can kind of

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,320
be reused for things that are not

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:53,320
entities like if I want to embed a

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,180
YouTube video and configure how I want

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,030
it displayed with height and width like

00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,070
it's kind of the same principle or if I

00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,350
want to embed a field from the same

00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,730
entity it's kind of the same principle I

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,730
want to pick which field and how to

00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,410
display it so we're probably going to be

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:12,070
expanding this concept a little bit more

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:14,500
with like an embed API and entity in bed

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,540
will be one version that kind of

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,110
supports that so there may be a URL

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,960
embed for your kind of remote media and

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,600
YouTube Vimeo that kind of stuff field

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,030
embedding short code for like just kind

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,590
of you put in something and it gets

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,660
output is something else kind of it's

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,820
what's a wordpress thing we want to make

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:38,890
sure we support it so there's going to

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:41,860
be more coming there and so media entity

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,660
was engine mentioned before file entity

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,720
is the the other kind of storage

00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,810
solution for how we refer to media or

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,330
files it's a it's a big module in Drupal

00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:56,320
7 and we do still plan on porting it

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:59,110
it's been started a port right now but

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,550
we haven't worked on it too much and we

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,220
want to abstract it a little bit more

00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:06,280
like file entity does so much right now

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,470
it exposes the U is for listing adding

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,780
editing deleting your files it makes

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,920
them feel double it adds

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,020
like you can have different file types

00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,320
you can have audio files video files

00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,730
like it does a lot of work on one so we

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,980
maybe want to split it up a little bit

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,230
maybe it's just we expose the UI first

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,880
that's just what people like out of the

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,430
box and if you want fields on your files

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,860
you can enable that extra two but you

00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,150
don't have to have that out of the box

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,690
so we're going to split it split that up

00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,400
a little bit more another interesting

00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,820
module that we'd worked on is called

00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,190
fallback formatter so for any kind of

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,380
field that has more than one formatter

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,980
available you get this fall back for

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,950
matter and it says well okay try the

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:53,290
default for matter for this field and if

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,300
it doesn't return anything then go try

00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,620
the trimmed for matter and see if that

00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,530
returns something and if that does

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:04,000
return show that so it's just a way to

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:06,160
provide multiple options if you are

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,250
familiar with file entity in Drupal 7 it

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,680
kind of has this concept but 45 managing

00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,560
file display and we wanted to abstract

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,140
it out this is kind of a nice way like

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,740
if you had a formatter for audio tag or

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,350
video tag and you had a file field that

00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,540
accepted both audio and video this is

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,250
the way to make it display for both

00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,470
things because you could say hey first

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,600
try the video for matter and if it

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,660
didn't work display as an audio field

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,740
and it'll support both things then in

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:42,400
the same field and we also induce some

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,410
some other small things file image for

00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,110
matters was a small thing I wrote that's

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,750
lets you use image field for matters for

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,540
your file fields if you upload images in

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:55,270
a file field you can't output them as an

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:58,180
image style so I wanted to fix that so

00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:01,240
that's a nice little reusable thing and

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,100
we also want to write a formatter module

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,530
for an entity reference field that lets

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,930
you output only a specific field on that

00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,630
referenced entity in a certain format er

00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:15,640
so like just making sure there's lots of

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:17,140
options available and so kind of a big

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,140
question then is what happens with the

00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,540
media module itself or the skald module

00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,599
you know these were these large modules

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,559
trying to do so many things

00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,879
hopefully now that we split all these

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,799
things up we're going to have a lot more

00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:32,409
dependencies but we're in control of

00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,570
those and it should be a lot more easier

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:36,879
to just be like exporting some default

00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,320
configuration to this module and maybe a

00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:39,909
little bit of glue code to make sure we

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,580
brings all together and it all works

00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:44,139
really nicely together it's like media

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:48,309
will ship with its own entity browser

00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:50,379
configuration and an entity embed button

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:53,979
configuration to make sure that it just

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:55,029
works that's the plan for those we

00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:56,639
haven't really gotten started with that

00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:00,009
since we're focused on the components

00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:02,829
and if you would like to come help we

00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:05,320
have a weekly IRC meeting in the pound

00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:07,929
Drupal dash media channel we'd love to

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,389
have you join us there we do most of our

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,940
primary development on github in the

00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,500
drupal dash media organization now but

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,409
we automatically put that back to Drupal

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,990
the door when we're done with code 2 we

00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,980
have a group Drupal group and we have

00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:28,720
we're going to be at the sprint on

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:31,419
Friday so any questions it was just too

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,859
good okay it's a good so I kind of see

00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:34,720
the thing happening with again that like

00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:36,639
Dave Reed owns twenty percent of your

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,819
modules because you split up media and

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,049
then there are a lot of modules again

00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:43,690
yeah it's just a secret ploy for me to

00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:46,869
be able to write more modules that's

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:49,089
that's the goal yeah okay cool and yeah

00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:50,980
at one question like the whole embed is

00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:54,250
that depending on ck editor or will it

00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,770
work with any busy week so the entity

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,660
embed stuff since its Drupal 8 and

00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,809
Drupal 8 ships with ckeditor by default

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,190
that's what we integrate with by default

00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:05,890
I'm not sure how it's going to shape out

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,079
with Drupal 8 and alternative WYSIWYG

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,660
editors but it's theoretical it should

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,960
support those as well just it hasn't

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,270
really happened yet so okay in the

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,520
background it works with in the

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,430
background it works with text filters so

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,520
you could technically manually enter the

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,190
correct HTML tag and it should be

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,500
translated so you don't need wysiwyg to

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,059
actually embed stuff okay and another

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,529
question maybe that's a political one

00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:35,529
but there was once a discussion about

00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:38,349
through paulo media inc or as an

00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:40,690
initiative so it looks like that's all

00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:43,119
no not or can you tell us anything about

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,640
that um as far as we know there's no

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,640
official official Drees sanctioned

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,819
initiative for media so we've kind of

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,979
taken it on as our team to to push do

00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:56,049
our best with pushing us forward and

00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:57,940
organizing ourselves you know we would

00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:59,680
welcome in an official initiative I kind

00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,440
of told Ruiz that so we'll see if it

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,630
happens and it's totally possible like

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,789
this stuff could be added in Drupal 8.1

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,999
or a point to down the road too so

00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:12,069
that's not out of the option as well

00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:15,039
okay yeah and there were some

00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:17,799
improvements in the eighth we can now

00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:21,339
finally upload multiple files in one

00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:23,890
step we have file listing there is there

00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:26,319
by default so when you when you upload

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,970
things into image or file fields you get

00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:31,930
a listing which is a view and you can

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:35,289
change it of course and you can embed

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:38,380
images into WYSIWYG by default just with

00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:42,849
core so we only need to handle embedding

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:45,069
for other types of media ok cool there

00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:47,170
is a question yeah I was just wondering

00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:51,039
the rules module had an estimate of

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:53,319
getting a ready end of 2014 maybe

00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:57,609
beginning 2015 do you have an estimate

00:36:53,319 --> 00:37:00,549
when you think media will be ported i

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:02,259
will just say when it's done because we

00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:05,710
don't have any funding and it's all

00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:09,279
volunteer basis right now so people fund

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,479
yeah if we won't accept funding yes we

00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:12,279
can probably I mean we've already

00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,660
finished one major component with empty

00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:17,440
embed so like we're making of good

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,390
progress I I would hope that we have a

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,849
usable set of stuff by the time drew

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,489
plates released so I think that's the

00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:26,229
same with rules it's like the more the

00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,670
web it walls we have more and more media

00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,469
we have more and more in beds from other

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,539
sites but think that's definitely

00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:33,670
something we can focus on yeah I mean

00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:35,349
we're kind of trying to solve some

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,140
really hard problems with embedding and

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,640
the entity selections it's like these

00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,529
are modules that are they have at least

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,630
10 different solutions right now in

00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:45,549
Drupal 7 so like as soon as we can get

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,229
these out and workable now we can get

00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:49,450
more people using them and have them be

00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:50,910
like the officially sanctioned one which

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,030
I think will be a lot of progress in

00:37:50,910 --> 00:38:06,599
that forward in decor so yep cool okay

00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:12,210
good thank you so will you do it I don't

00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:17,760
care you can do okay next one and search

00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:19,740
api hello I'm Tamas idol AK drunk monkey

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,609
and the maintainer of the Search API

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:27,240
module so I'm going to talk about it's a

00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:29,910
triple 8 version now we're going to

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,650
change is compared to Drupal 7 love is

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,170
still in discussion so if you're

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:37,410
interested please look at that meta

00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,900
issue and child their shoes create your

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,170
own and justice castles us in what

00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:46,559
direction we shall take this drupal 8

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,180
port one decision we have already made

00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,000
is that the basic architecture will

00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,700
remain unchanged so it is used search it

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,420
behind past you still have searched

00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:01,049
shape searchers search indexes much the

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,900
same configuration in both and yeah

00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:05,700
creating searches and indexes but we

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,650
focused on a lot of the problems we

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,869
spotted in the Drupal 7 version a lot of

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,440
time relating to flexibility just

00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:18,539
problems that we really didn't think of

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,569
when creating the serchhip in the first

00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:23,880
place and then which turned out to be

00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:27,089
pretty hard to solve in Drupal 7 with

00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,980
the fixed architecture so we doing a lot

00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,690
there to improve the triple-eight

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,029
version to be able to solve all these

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,279
problems and more cleanly which we

00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:37,730
identified in triple seven and on the

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:41,549
other hand user experience because I'm

00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:45,029
usability was also pretty poor or at

00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:47,549
least of especially for new users and a

00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:50,400
lot of them had problems just figuring

00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:53,250
out how to do the other come up with the

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,180
basic search and what each setting means

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:59,730
and there was a lot of issues regarding

00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,730
wrong configuration so we also try to

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,620
solve that interpolate by providing

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,600
better guidance to users

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,390
I'm so going a bit into detail about

00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,940
flexibility improvements one large

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,000
improvement there is that search indexes

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,030
will now not be restricted to a single

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,280
item type so previously in triple seven

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:23,660
you could only have index with nodes or

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,220
with user profiles or with whatever else

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,620
but now in true plate you can just

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,690
create one index which has all the item

00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:33,330
types you need in searches and with that

00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:36,540
but you have vastly better and support

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,220
of creating a unified Site Search which

00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,530
is something that a lot of people need

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,990
but was very hard to do in Drupal 8 at

00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,300
triple seven so I think that's one of

00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:49,020
the really create improvements in

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,460
through blade then under the hood we've

00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,900
just made a lot of more components

00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,530
pluggable so things that were previously

00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,810
hard-coded can now be swapped out for

00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:03,840
specific use cases and also things that

00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:06,540
weren't previously configurable are

00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,050
configurable now for example here we

00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,870
have the item types on the index can be

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,900
configured more so when you say you want

00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,880
to an index people day nodes then you

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,820
can right away say which content types

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,400
should be indexed from the nodes and

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,800
this is also something a lot of people

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,760
request in triple seven and most hard to

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,830
solve there so this is also now a

00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,370
possible much more cleanly and should

00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:37,710
also am provide yeah great improvement

00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:41,450
for a lot of sites regarding user

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:44,490
experience um there was just a lot of

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:47,310
work done on the user interface is just

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:50,280
making the other page is mostly a more

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:54,300
cleaner and easier to use easier to

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,050
understand and of course also leveraging

00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,010
all the core improvements here we are

00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:02,130
talking about revising some of the

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,890
terminology and already did it so that

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,080
we better convey the meaning behind some

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:11,220
of the special terms use my search api

00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,170
also also to hopefully help new users to

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:17,520
understand what we mean with the

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:18,510
different terms and components something

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,480
that we've planned is

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:24,060
doing a simplified user interface and

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,450
I'd really love to see that so that if

00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:30,720
you're a new user you can just you have

00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,910
just no excess right away to the

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,950
advanced user interfaces we have it now

00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:38,280
and just make a simple wizard for

00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:40,680
setting up the search with which use

00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,460
default value sensible default values

00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:48,990
for the more complex settings and just

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:53,540
allows to basically to configure a few

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:56,280
searches and only then allows you to

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,620
switch on the advanced user interface if

00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,050
you have really a use case for dad need

00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,990
to configure it more but otherwise

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,780
height complex ability for new users and

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:09,270
of course you also plan to support the

00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:12,090
tour module which is non core which

00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:17,430
should hopefully also help new users get

00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:19,980
started so that sounds all good how are

00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,110
we doing with that well a lot of the

00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,030
existing functionality from the

00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:30,630
framework from the framework itself is

00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:33,630
ported or really all of it but other

00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:35,220
than a few backends so database back in

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,020
and soul are also ported and wherever

00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,740
we've had a google Summer of Code

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,930
student work on elastic search and a bit

00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,910
of diffuse in the creation is already

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:50,190
finished but not much more regarding

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,320
conjured modules so they're still offer

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,810
to do and a lot of the improvements

00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,970
we've already planned to do in the true

00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:00,270
plate version need to be implemented as

00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:02,610
well so um we're still pretty far from

00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,590
what while it is already usable and I've

00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:07,400
heard just yesterday that someone is

00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:13,350
using it on production with 20,000 nodes

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:16,350
lunatic but yeah so it's it's very much

00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:19,560
usable already but it's still a lot of

00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:22,650
way to go until we even get an all four

00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,840
then even every release we are working

00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:28,620
the whole week here at triple crown on

00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:31,579
it and we are also having a person fail

00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:34,069
session tomorrow at 1045 so if you

00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:36,799
to her huge smod tail provide your own

00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:41,150
opinion and discuss things then please

00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:42,680
also come there and yeah otherwise if

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,390
you're interested in Search API and

00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,989
interested in seeing its true plate

00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:50,239
version soon then there are many ways to

00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:53,930
help with that first of course if you

00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,299
are developer then we're sure to have

00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:58,640
some tasks for your level even if you're

00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:01,489
new to the Search API it's a great way

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,369
to get started because um will give you

00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:07,390
just to explain things to you and then

00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:10,969
get you started with some easy tasks and

00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:13,670
yeah is great for getting your feeling

00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:15,650
of the Search API code in i'm sooo damn

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,819
you can find some cool launch always

00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:20,900
contact us we have an IRC channel we are

00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:24,739
discussing things and also weekly

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:27,170
hangout meeting otherwise if you're not

00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:30,049
a programmer you're still welcome to

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:32,180
join the discussions in the issues just

00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:33,829
provide your own opinions don't use

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,789
cases your own problems with the search

00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:40,219
app and triple seven what we could what

00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:43,699
we could improve and make easier to do

00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:45,410
intraplate and finally especially for

00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,930
companies if you're using the search

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,670
ebay and are planning to use it's a

00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,199
triple 8 version soon it would be a

00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,390
really create to get some funding

00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:57,349
because i currently we are almost

00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:59,690
completely unfounded and especially for

00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:03,289
me it's getting hard to get enough verb

00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:06,140
a working time to bring this forward and

00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:08,449
keep the momentum and also I'm getting

00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,969
funding for Sprint's is always a great

00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:12,680
way to push the project forward so and

00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:16,579
if you want to do it and please contact

00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:19,759
me and we're sure to find some wave how

00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:23,739
you can contribute in a way to make

00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,739
sense to you thank you

00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:38,239
any questions already yeah just go to

00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:38,239
the microphone we have time

00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:50,380
hi I read some discussions about a posh

00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,090
solar in the in the group of eight you

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,660
are talking about the search api base

00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,520
model but the about the pash-shan of

00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,550
model and the Search API solar

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,640
integration they are merging what

00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,560
exactly will happen exactly so what will

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,870
happen is basically that there will only

00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,800
be a Search API based solar module

00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:13,000
interpolate when we are two modules and

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,730
support all the use case that either of

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,790
them supported in triple seven with new

00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,650
search ebay solar module so this is also

00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:23,020
of course a great improvement for users

00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,270
who are previously confused with the two

00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:28,840
modules in which of those should be used

00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:31,060
and we'll just try to make one kick-ass

00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:36,820
so I'm all yelling through played that

00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:42,460
yeah it's best for everyone thanks so

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:44,020
what about so about backends we have

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,140
talked about solar starter pack ends

00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:50,170
available yeah database back-end is also

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,440
already ported and working quite well

00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:56,470
and elastic search was partially ported

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,600
I don't know about the other modules but

00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:01,630
I don't think any of those have started

00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,850
working yet but of course I expect that

00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,900
most of those that are available in

00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,410
triple Sam will also be available

00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:13,170
interplay it at some point and finally

00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:15,880
what about the facets Brown golfing's is

00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:19,570
coming up soon and he's already evolved

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:22,090
nah we don't know yet um so but we'll

00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,700
probably causing that tomorrow too so if

00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,980
you are if you have about two months

00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,530
free time and no facet API then please

00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,300
will be eternally grateful and otherwise

00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,530
yeah I will just figure out what to do

00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:37,390
with that what about multilingual search

00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:43,030
sorry what about much hi lingual search

00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:46,720
oh yeah so since uh translations are

00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,910
pretty pretty well supported in Drupal 8

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,640
core now we figured that this needs to

00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,500
be supporting searched by two so what

00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,750
you had previous is with the Search API

00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,910
entity translations module is now

00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,460
I'm completely baked into the search it

00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:03,370
back for in-vehicle ready so by default

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,820
you'll have all of the translation of

00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:09,100
entities index right away can search

00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:13,060
through them based on the language and

00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:15,970
we'll also plan to support that way

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,500
better in Seoul are too in some way so

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,440
that if you have moved to lingual side

00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:25,630
and the solar settings will make sense

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:27,250
they're too great good i got one

00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,190
question and so there will still be

00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,200
searched in drupal 8 core and when i

00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,110
enable Search API will it automatically

00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:38,710
replace it or will the URLs change how

00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:40,450
is the idea there um duh I think the

00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,490
approach here will be same instant

00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:45,400
triple seven it will well let's ignore

00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:47,560
coarser so you should probably disable

00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,750
it if you're using search api but there

00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,460
is no plans on doing some automatic

00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:55,630
replacement or something the creation

00:49:51,460 --> 00:50:02,080
there good thank you thanks thanks so

00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:03,520
much so i think and i actually think he

00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,200
mentioned a really interesting point so

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,910
if you are currently using drupal 7

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,640
modules and you have a really big pain

00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,920
point with search api or whatever other

00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,170
modules go to the maintainer and talk to

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,940
them and because most of the stuff

00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,330
anybody and if any way has to be

00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:21,820
rewritten so why not write it in a

00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,800
better way so I think if you have any

00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,290
idea of any modules talk to these people

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,000
right now is the time because probably

00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:30,190
in a year for the next three years there

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,260
will be no upgrade anymore and they will

00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,820
be stuck with that functionality so now

00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,010
is the time to talk to the people and

00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:39,340
convince them with a beer or not however

00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:43,660
you want to do that and to to change the

00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:49,720
functionality good the next one before

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:52,050
we make a short break is course what you

00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,050
want to do

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,359
well thank you

00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,410
ok so I'm bonds Ivanovic barnsey on

00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:15,900
drupal.org and i am the development

00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:18,210
leave for commerce to the text i work

00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:23,069
for commerce guys and I'm paged to work

00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:25,589
on drupal commerce full-time three years

00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:28,619
ago we released Commerce one point 0

00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:31,440
back at triple con London and in that

00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:35,400
time we have reached almost 50,000 live

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,980
installs and the reason why commerce

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,839
became so popular is because we built it

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,750
from scratch on the new technologies

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,839
that Drupal 7 gave us and by doing that

00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:48,420
we became immediately familiar to anyone

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,730
who was already familiar with Drupal 7

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,849
itself we were then able to take these

00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:56,280
concepts and push it further in ways

00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:59,910
that later became standard for example

00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,640
by using vuze for admin listings so in

00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:05,280
order to replicate that success we must

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,920
once again start from scratch completely

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,319
and build something new for Drupal 8 and

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,660
the completely new technologies that it

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,390
itself brings so we are starting from

00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,579
scratch we are taking into account every

00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,859
single angry comments you ever posted to

00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,420
the Commerce issue queue any feedback we

00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:25,319
might have received or experiences we

00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:28,740
had dealing with our own projects and of

00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:32,250
course one of the big themes of trouble

00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:34,170
8 is getting off the island so we found

00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:37,260
the boat of our own and we are doing the

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:39,480
same and we are doing that by taking the

00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,880
core drupal commerce functionality and

00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,490
releasing it as completely separate

00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,369
standalone PHP components because when

00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:50,099
you think about it currencies and prices

00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:51,869
and taxes and addressing and payments

00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,359
and so much more none of this is

00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:56,190
specifically tied to Drupal and even if

00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:58,290
we use entities for data storage and

00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:01,890
other Drupal AP is that doesn't mean

00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:03,480
that there is no separate core so that's

00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,369
why we've started developing the

00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,430
libraries and that has been our primary

00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:10,020
focus in the past two months which is

00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:13,260
how much how long we've been developing

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,270
all this so the first library that we've

00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,360
created is called internationalization

00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:20,280
and it significantly improves

00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,830
currensy handling and currency

00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,810
formatting back with Commerce Wanda tags

00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,150
we shipped with a completely static

00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:30,060
currency list which was not good because

00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,460
it had holes and it's called deprecated

00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,680
or outdated pretty quickly because

00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:38,220
currencies change or inflation it's the

00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,320
subunits we also tied formatting to the

00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:43,740
currency itself which meant that one

00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,900
currency could only have one set of

00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,540
formatting rules rules such as where

00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,520
does the symbol go and which grouping

00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,140
and decimal separators do we use and so

00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,000
on and when you look at my numbers when

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,560
you look at three different zero amounts

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,110
you will realize that they are all

00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,060
difference the first one is how it will

00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,680
look in France the second one is how it

00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,020
looks in Germany and the third one is

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,460
how it looks in the UK so we realized

00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,340
that this time around we needed to do

00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:10,260
currency formatting per locale so

00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,410
ideally we wanted to have a way to

00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:15,960
automatically generate the currency list

00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:18,690
and to automatically gather the

00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,990
formatting information and we managed to

00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:24,570
find that in the CLD our project so the

00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:27,420
CLD our project is a repository of data

00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,070
that's assembled by Apple and Google and

00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,080
Microsoft and other big players it's

00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,090
used pretty much everywhere Drupal 8

00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,340
uses it for its currency list for its

00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:38,220
country list and we use it for

00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:41,030
currencies so it gives us a set of all

00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:44,190
currencies in the world and it gives us

00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:45,960
translations for 250 locales which is

00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:48,690
pretty much every single language and

00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,030
country you can think of so that means

00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,550
that for every country for every locale

00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:55,830
we have the translated currency name and

00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:59,760
even the translated currency symbol and

00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:03,180
the formatting data for all of those

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,890
countries which is really something and

00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,810
on the Drupal side we import the

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,090
currencies into config entities and

00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,500
automatically create translations for

00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,540
all of the languages that you have

00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,630
defined on your site and when you add a

00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,550
new language we will automatically

00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:21,000
import the translations for that as well

00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:23,430
so we use that to create really create

00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,190
number formatter that replicates what

00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,870
the PHP internationalization extension

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,780
does we couldn't depend on it because

00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:32,280
it's not present in most PHP installs

00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,760
but we managed to replicate it using

00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,850
the data found here and so we even

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,100
support cases such as Arabic or Hindu

00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:43,080
numerals so if you're doing an Arab

00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,910
excite they really expect the prices to

00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,400
be shown using their own numbers that

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:50,450
wasn't possible before it's possible now

00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,400
so all things considered we are

00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:55,950
significantly better equipped to handle

00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,140
multilingual and multi matte websites

00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,610
now symphony has a library of their own

00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,910
called internationalisation which

00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:05,310
limited itself only to english but since

00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:09,750
we publish this they express the desire

00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:11,340
to change that so by symphony 2.7 all of

00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,070
this functionality will be in symphony

00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:17,460
itself which is a really nice example of

00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,560
cross project collaboration and it's

00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,680
been our first success the second

00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:25,190
library we made is called addressing we

00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:28,620
we previously had address field which

00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:30,800
which was pretty okay but the problem in

00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:35,220
was that it didn't have predefined

00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,800
formats for many countries so mmm things

00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:40,680
such as which fields are used Howard are

00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,290
they required how is the zip code

00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:46,020
formatted what are the subdivisions for

00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,300
example US states that are used all that

00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,860
data needed to be collected manually and

00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,040
because of that we didn't have support

00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,080
for that many countries out of the box

00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:57,450
however google has created a great new

00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,150
data set in the meantime that they use

00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:02,250
for android and since it's freely

00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,440
available we are actually parsing that

00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,330
and including it in our library so that

00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:10,020
means that for commerce to the text we

00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:11,610
have predefined address formats for 200

00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:14,220
countries and we have predefined

00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:17,070
subdivisions for 40 countries including

00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:20,820
their translations and we use that data

00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:24,860
to generate the address forms to do to

00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:26,700
generate the shipping slips and

00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,550
everything else that needs to be done

00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,530
and once again address field pulls in

00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:34,230
this library defines the config entities

00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:37,410
which hold the data and then uses that

00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:39,060
to generate the Drupal forms and this

00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:41,790
library has also been very successful

00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,520
for us in the sense that we've been

00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:45,760
trending on github as the most popular

00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,690
repository for a fee

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,000
days the new week came around so that's

00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:55,090
now gone but we enjoyed our five minutes

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,300
and glory so those were the first two

00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:00,280
libraries and now one at rubicon we are

00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,740
focusing on releasing the second to the

00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,950
first one introduces the concept of

00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,900
zones so you can define for example a

00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,790
zone that's called the European Union

00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,060
has a set of countries or a zone that's

00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:17,200
called Germany and France or a zone

00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:20,380
that's called German v80 so for example

00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,480
German v80 is used in Germany and five

00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,090
Austrian zip codes so you can define

00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,220
that and the point of this is to define

00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:30,130
the zones that are used for taxes or

00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,750
shipping and use it to significantly

00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:34,420
decrease the number of conditions that

00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:36,250
you need to have in a rule or a hook to

00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:39,370
do your own thing so it really

00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,350
simplifies those use cases that's the

00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:44,440
first one the second one that we are

00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:46,600
building is called tax and this is our

00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,180
most ambitious one we want to

00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,520
significantly improve the commerce

00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,090
support for taxes especially bringing in

00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,380
the improvements that we've had in

00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:58,600
modules such as commerce v80 and

00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,520
commerce euv 80s so this module will

00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,010
have predefined tax rates for all of

00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,480
Europe for Canada for Australia whatever

00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:06,430
we can gather there is no external

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,620
source for this so we're going to have

00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:10,450
to do it ourselves and then we're going

00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,760
to optimize for all the common use cases

00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:14,770
for example selling digital products and

00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,700
the way taxes are handled there versus

00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:21,190
shippable ones Canada Texas which can be

00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,140
added together and have some different

00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:27,730
rules for determining the place of

00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:30,850
supply and so on in general our taxes

00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:33,460
requirements are twice more complex than

00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:35,080
they were in 10 texts and we are really

00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,030
looking forward to making this easier on

00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:42,010
you by handling the tricky parts

00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:44,410
ourselves so we we made all these cool

00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,810
libraries but you came here to hear

00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:50,110
about the module the module is being

00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:52,780
developed on github primarily because we

00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:55,870
are using Travis the build bot to run

00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:57,490
our own tests and drupal.org BOTS don't

00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:00,220
support composer

00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:02,890
so that's why we needed to go to github

01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,960
and we really enjoy pull requests so

01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:08,350
that we will keep using it hub up until

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,930
we reach a beta early next year and by

01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:13,780
that time we should be ready to get back

01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:15,970
the drupal.org and we are mirroring all

01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,560
the commits so you can go there and send

01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,600
a pull request we are still using the

01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,730
drupal.org issue queue so if you want to

01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,590
start working on a task this week you

01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:27,970
can go to our normal chocolate org issue

01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:30,910
queue and start looking at that the

01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:33,040
future is bright and we have many many

01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:34,930
plans so for example we are killing the

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,880
concept of product displays you now only

01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:39,160
have products and the products can exist

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,140
in a hierarchy if you want so you can

01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,110
see an example of one where you have a

01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:46,540
hierarchy for that's based on colors and

01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:49,119
sizes we are also looking into

01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:52,720
completely recreating the payment API to

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:55,570
be more powerful and to make payment

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,460
modules much much easier to implement we

01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,790
are looking into the Omni pay library as

01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,410
a base for this effort but I'm not yet

01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:06,480
sure how that will turn out we'll see

01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:09,490
I'm definitely interested though I

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,170
really want to credit all of the awesome

01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:15,369
contributors that we've had in the

01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:17,680
previous two months so and while they

01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:20,980
can still fit on one slide of course so

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,020
yell Becker has had 26 commits added to

01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:26,170
commerce Pedro comberton and these guys

01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:29,050
have commits that have more than three

01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:30,640
thousand lines of code usually so even

01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:33,250
the number itself is not the most

01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,400
impressive thing josh taylor has had an

01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:40,930
Matt claim and six and the Giles one

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,760
David kitchen1 so we've had all six very

01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,730
persistent non commerce guys

01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,980
contributors working day by day on

01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,410
making commerce to attacks a reality and

01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:52,810
I'm really thrilled to see that and I'm

01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:55,780
hoping that the number of them will

01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:58,180
increase more and more so you can

01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:01,960
install commerce today you can create

01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:04,720
the product list it do other basic

01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:08,230
things and the reason why we are making

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,940
so much progress is because of them if

01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:13,480
you have any questions

01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:16,150
we have above tomorrow at 1045 emerald

01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,369
lounge II I'm really looking forward to

01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,349
hearing all of your stories use cases

01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:23,170
frustration so we can make sure we do it

01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:26,740
right this time so whatever you have to

01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:30,790
discuss then is a great moment we also

01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:34,109
do office hours every Thursday on IRC so

01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:39,099
3 p.m. gmt + 2 which is most of europe

01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:41,140
come to IRC and start discussing or crab

01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:43,390
an issue we will be happy to guide you

01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,280
in we have issues of all sizes from two

01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:50,490
hours to two months choose your poison

01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,490
and that's it for me

01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:59,930
thank you for young any questions were

01:02:56,869 --> 01:03:04,250
commerce yeah we've heard with rules

01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:06,680
that rules is not yet ready but should

01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:10,130
be for a lot of concrete models based on

01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,440
rules such as Commerce so where is

01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:15,890
Commerce regarding not those

01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:22,270
architectural founding things but really

01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:26,690
usable being a usable module i would say

01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:29,710
early 2015 at the best i'm aiming to

01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:31,970
have a release around middle 2015 and

01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:35,630
we'll see how that goes and whether a

01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:37,760
beta happens in February or April it's

01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:39,950
really too early to tell but we are

01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,530
doing monthly blog post updates that

01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:48,109
should provide a better estimate as we

01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:50,990
go along I was curious since you're

01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:53,869
moving toward components to know if you

01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:56,810
consider silliest as a possible project

01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:59,390
to you know kind of use or collaborate

01:03:56,810 --> 01:04:01,820
with yeah we've had a lot of contact

01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:03,320
with Silius they're great guys I'm

01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:06,140
really hoping that they will actually

01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,849
use our address in code and we've also

01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:10,730
been in contact with to the Sonata guys

01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:13,160
we're also interested in our taxes so

01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:16,070
there will be collaboration I'm not yet

01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,930
sure who will take what series doesn't

01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:20,080
really have reusable components at the

01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:23,330
moment they're very basic but we are

01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:28,609
actively talking with them and to them

01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:33,109
about changing that okay is there going

01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:35,630
to be a better support in the roadmap in

01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:38,750
Drupal 8 for a two-way marketplace in

01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:40,910
commerce yes we now have a commerce tour

01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:44,000
entity by default that should allow us

01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:46,430
that and it should provide a very good

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,720
basis for a marketplace module we still

01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:50,150
don't know how much functionality will

01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,700
be in commerce itself but it's

01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:56,420
definitely more than there was before

01:04:51,700 --> 01:05:00,310
thank you I really liked you try to like

01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:03,589
get off the island and I'm curious

01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:05,660
obviously as the rules guys we are

01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:05,910
interested in what is your take on the

01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,470
fun

01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:09,510
melody that it currently implement using

01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,849
rules are you planning to do that with

01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:14,579
ruse or like maybe something else yeah

01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:17,250
so from a developer standpoint I would

01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:19,770
say rules is more of a nice to have but

01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:23,400
from a site builders 10.8 it's

01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:25,049
definitely a must-have we are working on

01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,670
being able to use commerce without rules

01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:31,170
at the moment but I'm really following

01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:34,309
rows development closely and will then

01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:37,619
see my current plan is to just omit

01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:39,869
events by default and have rules be one

01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:42,329
of the listeners allowing people to use

01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:44,039
or not use rules as they choose but

01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:49,440
assuming that most people will still

01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:58,530
want to use rules it's cool thanks for

01:05:49,440 --> 01:06:01,109
young so we're actually bit ahead of

01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:03,270
time so I think what we can do we do the

01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:05,460
next three parts and then we're actually

01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:07,920
probably finished before the next

01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,569
session starts so we won't even use the

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,010
two sessions so in case you want to see

01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:13,319
the next one which only starts in half

01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,480
an hour you can still do that and we do

01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:18,049
and now this place suite then we have

01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:21,059
simple news and actually for more

01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:23,599
modules all in one token redirect and

01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:30,089
all these things but now this place we'd

01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:32,190
hi so display sweet so we have a small

01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:34,650
team working on display sweets and

01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:37,049
drupal 7 before first of all you have

01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:40,500
Christoph Vandal he started the module

01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:43,049
few years ago Drupal 6 and he's still

01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:46,010
doing some work on it and drupal 8 now

01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:49,410
and my name is blah miss polishes I

01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:52,920
started working on the Drupal 7 module

01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:57,839
as part of my internship with Crimson na

01:06:52,920 --> 01:07:00,180
muna crowd and at the moment I'm mainly

01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:02,910
focused on the Drupal 8 sport and I

01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:05,460
built most part of it and then we have

01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:10,650
Chris he's the guy that suffers the

01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:13,529
Drupal 7 do pro 6 surface on the Drupal

01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:15,210
6 port so he maintains its but he's not

01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:18,480
going to add new features he's just

01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:21,300
fixing critical bugs if they occur

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,640
and then you have others that just made

01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:28,109
small patches that we committed I love

01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:31,950
those people right away so when we

01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:34,380
started with the boat for Drupal 8 we

01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:37,680
didn't want to change a lot and the user

01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:40,200
interface because after the rebuild the

01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,940
7.2 rebuilt we got some nice comments

01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,430
from people that they liked the new

01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:47,700
interface and we would I we plan to keep

01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:51,359
it for it for Drupal 8 so the mainly the

01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:54,540
main focus for us was rebuilding a

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:57,720
display suite on the new architecture of

01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:00,660
Drupal 8 but keep DUI as simple as

01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:02,160
possible but as this is a site builder

01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,490
track i'm going to focus on the things

01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:10,050
that has changed has changed for example

01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:13,710
oh it is not clear but most people know

01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:17,580
the PHP code field you could inject

01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:20,160
speech be from the UI by just entering

01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:23,089
some lines say i wanted on the notes on

01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:27,420
that bundle and then you had some nice

01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:31,859
injected PHP in your display but as we

01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:34,290
all know this is good why because as

01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:36,870
fast is good for fastnet bits and you

01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:39,120
don't need a module but the evil part is

01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:41,370
way more important it's not secure it's

01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,700
not secure it's not secure and it's

01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:46,890
misused a lot i have many bug reports in

01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:49,970
the issue queue about people that doing

01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:53,160
crazy stuff with that code field and

01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:56,190
drupal 8 decided to remove the beach hbu

01:08:53,160 --> 01:09:00,660
filter from corn so so did we so we

01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:02,910
moved to pitch be filled field yeah some

01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:05,940
may hate me so may love me now but I

01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:08,069
don't care and but we replaced it with a

01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:10,920
token field so it's the same

01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:14,730
functionality as the Drupal 7 code field

01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,549
but without a PHP part and to make up

01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:21,089
with the people that hate me now I

01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:23,279
rebuilt the DA's fields functions I made

01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:28,440
them plugins that's easy for developers

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:31,770
to implement a plugin and it's also

01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:33,719
easier for new people to do to learn how

01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:36,509
to how do you have to build to this

01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:38,430
field themselves there's drush

01:09:36,509 --> 01:09:39,839
integration I don't know if it's worth

01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:42,390
if it works at the moment because

01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,940
everything is broken at the moment but

01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:47,790
it worked last week and then you can

01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:50,489
just say sade rushed create des field

01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:52,109
and then tweets a class for you and you

01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:55,410
just have to implement a random methods

01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:58,010
so that's almost as easy as going to the

01:09:55,410 --> 01:10:00,570
field and do some dirty eggs in there

01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:05,850
the Taurus will follow when the port is

01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:09,600
done and when f more time so a new

01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:11,610
feature I added it was mainly as a joke

01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,280
at first time but it can be really handy

01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:17,160
is a copy of a desk display streatfield

01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,560
so i made a disparate fields that can

01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,410
copy a display sweet field so you can

01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:25,770
have two times the same fields only on

01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:28,050
your display without having yeah two

01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:34,230
functions that do that point to the same

01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:35,820
code and it's kind of awesome but at the

01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,920
moment it's only limited to displace

01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:42,600
wheat fields it would be better if we

01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:45,600
also could copy normal fields of orders

01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,969
auto stuff so you can have like one code

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,900
function that you can reuse put some

01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:53,880
settings in it and it does other stuff

01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:55,230
but yeah I need some help with the with

01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,900
all the field types because it's really

01:10:55,230 --> 01:11:02,760
complicated in you gettin into loops and

01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:04,830
stuff like that and some may know the

01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,790
dynamic field it was based on CTools

01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:10,710
magic and drupal 7 as there is no c

01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:13,320
tools yet interpolate and maybe there

01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:15,510
will not be c tools and drupal 8 so

01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:19,250
there is no replacement in Drupal 8 yet

01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:21,750
so if you if you use this feature lots

01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:24,420
please tell me so I know there's

01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:27,510
interested in so I know so I know there

01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:30,480
is interesting interested in in the

01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:33,630
future so I can see if I can do

01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,219
something about it but i'm not sure if

01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:39,960
there will be a dynamic field in drupal

01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:42,510
8 so we have like three field types now

01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,460
we have the block fields a token fields

01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:47,100
and create a copy of this place

01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:49,710
field those are pluggable this means

01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,770
that anyone can create their own type of

01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:55,320
pluggable you I fields and you can

01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,210
extend my base class so it's you have

01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,900
don't have to implement the entire form

01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:02,520
it's pretty easy and there will be there

01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,920
will be tutorials how you can do that

01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,960
for developers so sigh builders if you

01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,730
can't do it yourself just push your

01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,300
developer and say I need this I need is

01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:14,790
anita's and then they will build for you

01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:17,280
and and then we have a comparison

01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:22,469
between the Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 layout

01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:25,170
I UI interface it's kinda similar except

01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:27,000
the view Modestep that was visible in

01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:30,780
Drupal 7 it's disappeared from the

01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,580
Drupal 8 version why there are no more

01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,940
humid no it's not true they are still

01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:37,739
alive but they are moved to core so we

01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:42,030
don't have to maintain that code anymore

01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:44,480
which is good then we have the few

01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:47,610
templates there was a future that is

01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,890
it's almost the most popular feature of

01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:52,440
display sweet and there is the famous

01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:55,590
expert field template I think I have

01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,989
more than 20 issue reports a feature

01:12:55,590 --> 01:13:00,120
request that want to extend the expert

01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:05,370
field template because it's not expert

01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:08,190
enough I'm sick of it so I decided to

01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:11,610
feature freeze the expert template mm in

01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:14,460
2 / 7 this is now in deaf and I'm not

01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:18,170
going to add any more features to it but

01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:22,680
for Drupal 8 I made them plates

01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:26,040
pluggable so everyone can add new field

01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:28,770
templates by implementing three days ago

01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,510
but it's broken now so I'll fix it like

01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:36,960
a lot of stuff I'm going to fix this

01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:39,330
week but you can try it soon so like a

01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:43,050
setter or no big UI changes this is

01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:44,520
pretty much the same as before and the

01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,900
thing that has changed in the back end

01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,870
is that the templates are converted to

01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:52,380
take another team expert so I can use

01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:55,880
some teamer to review the templates and

01:13:52,380 --> 01:14:03,170
optimize where I needed

01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:06,530
yeah so what is the current status of

01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:10,429
display sweet it was functional last

01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:13,969
week chord changes fast eighty percent

01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:16,219
of the work is already done so please

01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:20,420
please please give it a try in the near

01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:23,360
future but do not use it in production

01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:25,070
yet I got several males this week from

01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,830
people that are that are trying to use

01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:29,449
it in production we will rewrite the

01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,429
storage of this place wait that's the

01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:33,409
twenty percent that has to be done so

01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:35,179
all your settings will be lost when you

01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:38,510
use it in production and you update to a

01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:40,820
new version of display sweet just a note

01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:46,010
i'm going to put like a big warning on

01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:48,860
the project page but so are there other

01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:53,120
layered modules ready apparently panels

01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:57,920
is busy so but it will not be finished

01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:00,170
before 2050 mid-2015 I don't know this

01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:09,650
place seat will be done before the end

01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:12,590
of the year I promised that a but if

01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:16,790
chord changes in 2015 and after we do my

01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:22,550
work that's not my problem just to be

01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:25,010
sure so you can contribute first of all

01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:29,090
you can code you can help us find bugs

01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:32,630
you can help fix bugs if you have a new

01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:35,090
feature you can build it if it's if I

01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,730
think it's it's usable for for everyone

01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:41,510
I'll put it into display sweets if it's

01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:43,969
some nice extra I can make a link on the

01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:50,719
display sweet page to link to your

01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:52,219
module and so others can find it I don't

01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,219
have a lot of time to work on this blue

01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:58,010
sweet so if there are people that needs

01:15:55,219 --> 01:16:01,780
a stable this proceed like before in

01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:08,090
November then you have to pay me sorry

01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:08,690
if you if you wanted before 2015 i'll do

01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:13,510
it for free

01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:15,860
so yeah so if you want specific features

01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:20,890
yeah i just talked to me and we'll see

01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:20,890
what i can do so that's it for me

01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:43,280
many questions this way sweet when I'm

01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,739
when the panels guys around stage they

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,889
said they were still wondering how to

01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:50,810
tackle the layouts because in Drupal 7

01:16:48,889 --> 01:16:53,570
they were based on CTools so they were

01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:55,270
interchangeable you could use panels

01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:57,679
layouts in display Sweden vice versa

01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:01,159
I've noticed you have already finished

01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:05,840
the layouts so how did you go about it

01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:07,699
it is that's a very good question I this

01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:12,550
is just a straight port from the display

01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:17,449
suites layouts and drupal 7 I started to

01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:20,449
to try make reusable layouts but it's

01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:22,070
very very very hard I had several

01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:23,690
discussions with several people how to

01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:28,179
do it at the moment there isn't a

01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:30,800
solution yet so I just made my solution

01:17:28,179 --> 01:17:32,600
when we figured something out we will

01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:37,880
combine them it will not break your

01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:40,699
settings or stuff like that and but just

01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,850
to be sure I just poured it's the Drupal

01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:47,420
7 layouts I hope we can figure something

01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:49,639
out with panels if not we have to live

01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:53,330
with separate layouts for panels and

01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:55,850
display suites and maybe I can include

01:17:53,330 --> 01:18:00,010
some panel layouts with some tweaks and

01:17:55,850 --> 01:18:07,630
vice versa but I hope we can manage to

01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:07,630
combine them okay cool thank you

01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:18,860
the next song sounds a bit spooky and

01:18:15,409 --> 01:18:21,050
it's bear deer so we figured out there

01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,840
are a lot of smaller modules that we all

01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:25,730
using Drupal 8 and drupal 7 so that's

01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,929
redirect global redirect token and path

01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:31,580
auto and Tasha said okay I'm going to do

01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:36,500
a presentation about all of them and

01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:39,320
give your short update of them okay yes

01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:42,860
so I guess I love you know those modules

01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:44,620
and use them on your sites so I'm not

01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:46,909
going to talk much about what they do

01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:50,000
redirect allows you to create a direct

01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:52,280
from one site to form on URL to order

01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,440
for examples mostly used when you pass

01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,050
out though and change you know title

01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:00,620
then they like make sure that all links

01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:02,390
still work to redirect allows to set up

01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:06,050
some settings and then it for example

01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:08,690
make sure that you are always on you era

01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:12,800
lawyers so when you go to note / 7 it

01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:14,150
retroactive to the right or else they're

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,100
talking about you will add two things

01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:18,530
and when it sets a lot more tokens than

01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:21,890
Drupal core has like tokens of fields

01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:24,830
and menus and a lot more and it has a

01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:28,670
token you I and pass out though allows

01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:30,980
to set allows you to set up rules on how

01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:32,810
to automatically create aliases for your

01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:36,949
news for example or other types of

01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:40,250
content so about me my name is Sasha

01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:42,550
Rosenberg my drupal username is better I

01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:45,739
ever get empty systems in Switzerland

01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:49,010
I'm a core contributor and entity field

01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:51,409
I pi maintainer and I'm not a maintainer

01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:53,929
of any of those modules but I'm involved

01:19:51,409 --> 01:19:59,000
in my drupal 8 pound reports and

01:19:53,929 --> 01:20:01,010
including those so about the changes

01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,650
there are a lot of a pie changes and

01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:05,300
core changed a lot so redirect and

01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:06,710
possible have to change a lot and the

01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,460
way that you have to integrate in the

01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:13,100
core change a lot and they're being

01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:16,250
updated improved and elevate them in

01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:19,310
Drupal 8 lies drupal 8 ways for example

01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:21,510
using services instead of functions so

01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:25,410
that certain parts can be replaced

01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:27,630
if you don't like how it works until

01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:30,570
however the look and feel decent face is

01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:33,090
mostly the same most of those these rain

01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:36,110
faces have just imported directly from

01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:40,080
Drupal 7 how they work in the possible

01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:43,680
so the status in general all of those

01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:46,770
modules are kind of working they have

01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:51,320
functional ports not that we chat there

01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:55,200
yet but I'm keeping them up and running

01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:57,900
whenever I can so starting with cobra

01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:00,240
direct as i said the basic function is

01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,850
working you can enable it and set it up

01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:07,350
an able the options you want and it's

01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:08,670
going to do those redirects it's already

01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:11,820
on drupal org so if you want to try it

01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:14,820
out go to the project page and give it a

01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,860
try there are some issues this language

01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:19,080
prefixes so if you have a multilingual

01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:21,720
site be careful there have been issues

01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,100
in Drupal 7 and there are new issues in

01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:26,790
the rubellite that you haven't figured

01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:29,460
out yet how to fix and there's a topic

01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:34,230
that always has been the idea to merge

01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,760
them merge the module into a direct that

01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:40,230
did not happen yet but it's still an

01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:43,320
option for Drupal 8 I think so this

01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:47,910
doesn't look right up to date back to

01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:50,610
this the direct module so again it's

01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,200
basically working it's integrated into

01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:55,380
pass out though and the manual UI for

01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:58,050
creating the direct is there you can set

01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:02,520
up your redirects as you were used to it

01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:07,280
in Drupal 7 it's currently on our github

01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:07,280
repository so you can get it from there

01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:12,870
the there are few things missing for

01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:15,210
example you're not using not yet using

01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:17,040
views for the you ice so the US are

01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:19,380
currently very busy very simple they

01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,760
have our packaging or filtering and all

01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,400
that stuff that you use from Drupal 7

01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:26,340
that's not yet there we will add that

01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,410
when we switch to using views for the US

01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:31,650
and there are some additional features

01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:35,119
and some of those various alter hooks

01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:38,070
and extension points or not area

01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:41,070
so that's how the module looks at the

01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:43,829
moment in Drupal 8 there's them user

01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:47,129
interface for adding redirect you can

01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:49,559
enter from URL that you want to get

01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:52,649
redirected and two very 12 a direct to

01:22:49,559 --> 01:22:58,320
that basically most of you isn't very

01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:59,939
sequency in this module and then you

01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,919
have the token module as I said it has

01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:06,300
two functions one is providing a ton of

01:23:03,919 --> 01:23:09,090
additional toxins that Drupal core

01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:12,329
doesn't have like four fields for menus

01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:14,429
and complicated tokens or extend

01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:18,030
flexible tokens like combining stuff

01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:21,360
into combining arrays and splitting them

01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:24,809
into strings and thrown so a lot of

01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:27,360
those are working and can be used

01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:30,030
already they often break because they're

01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:32,340
deeply integrated into core API so every

01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:36,449
time those ports slightly changed and it

01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:41,159
falls apart but I'm trying to keep it up

01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:43,739
to date and fixing those things the fill

01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:45,599
tokens are very limited at the moment so

01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:48,570
you can't they show up and use interface

01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:51,090
you can use them but they don't have any

01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:54,449
references yet and you don't come come

01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:56,459
control let this properties and leave

01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:58,679
them a different way that you just get

01:23:56,459 --> 01:24:02,369
to default output for those field values

01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:05,309
basically this is also on a github

01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:07,979
repository at the moment you can get it

01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:11,419
from there and ride out the second part

01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:14,280
of the module is that token you I that

01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:16,919
people try to get in Drupal core that

01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:19,829
didn't happen yet so it has to stay in

01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:23,639
the module for now it has been slightly

01:24:19,829 --> 01:24:27,030
updated to use the new jQuery jQuery UI

01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:30,209
that's now in Drupal core and then you

01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:32,249
displaced and then you overlay staff

01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:36,659
there but other than that there weren't

01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:38,760
many changes there's quite a lot to do

01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:40,889
in that module improving the tokens

01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:44,280
adding more test coverage so we know

01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:46,789
when things break and adding more tokens

01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,789
and

01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:53,890
and then you have the lot on of those

01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:57,400
modules or I forgot some of those

01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:59,739
legions moved around that's how the user

01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:03,190
interface looks at the moment there's

01:24:59,739 --> 01:25:04,750
that well known you can embed it

01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:06,969
directly into the page or you can have

01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:08,230
that pop up and that's how that pop up

01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:13,719
looks at the moment so you get your

01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:15,909
tokens and you can go into that table

01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:18,610
and click down and select the token you

01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:21,550
want it tests the same problems and

01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:22,929
limitations as it has in Drupal 7 like

01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:26,230
it explodes then you have a lot of

01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:28,989
fields that has no making more each

01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:31,900
module eight like so removing the hooks

01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:34,030
to endure for integration and instead

01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:36,030
using plugins to make it easier to

01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:38,620
extend to make it more flexible so that

01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:41,199
certain entity types can have certain

01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:43,060
logic in there and don't need to hard

01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:46,360
code but we don't need to work out

01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:50,830
things like logic for terms in the core

01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:52,540
module that's how the UI looks at the

01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:54,850
moment it's basically the same as in the

01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:56,530
seven you get those patterns that you

01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:59,530
can reload for each node type for each

01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:01,570
language for each node no type and so on

01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:06,250
and you can also see the token you I

01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:10,300
embedded here this is a slide that's

01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:13,090
more oriented at developers so in Drupal

01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:15,640
7 you you had to write a lot of code to

01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:17,350
integrate it with a new entity type you

01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:20,830
had to write implement different hooks

01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:24,429
you have to call pass order functions

01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:27,730
and define self and in Drupal 8 it's

01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:30,370
building on top of fields and widgets so

01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:33,670
in Drupal quarter pulse using the face

01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:37,060
is now a field that has a rigid so we

01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:38,560
basically just replaced that and for the

01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,409
users but it doesn't have any

01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,000
integration core that more or less all

01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:47,140
the code you need to integrate it and

01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,390
then you get the video ridgid on the

01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:51,489
manage form display page and you get

01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:54,280
that user interface where you can enter

01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:57,300
a manual alias or use the one that's

01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,300
generated for you

01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:06,310
I don't tell you many plans at the

01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:09,610
moment myself as I mentioned there are

01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:13,240
the best idea to merge a direct and

01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:15,790
globe legs together hopefully that will

01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,310
happen would be one less module you need

01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:21,460
to download and care about on a result

01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:25,060
and as I mentioned Kim pepper is working

01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:30,310
on making on converting pass out or two

01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:32,710
plugins and making it more flexible if

01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,530
you want to help there are some known

01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:38,680
issues in core for example the language

01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:40,990
graphic stuff that i mentioned last time

01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:44,740
i talked about this topic I had another

01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:46,990
core issue in here about pasta losses

01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:50,560
and how they change and how quantum is

01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:52,180
able to react to changes there has been

01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,310
some improvements there yet so I was

01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:57,310
able to remove that topic from this

01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:59,770
light which is nice token API could use

01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:02,860
a lot of help in Drupal core I'm not

01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:04,840
sure if still possible to improve that

01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:08,050
know that we will have the better this

01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,910
week if you want to help submit pull

01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:12,310
requests for the gita projects or

01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:16,330
patches for what is on drupal org you

01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:19,030
can also just use the time you have here

01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:22,000
to try it out install it experiment and

01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:24,280
report works and if you want to sprint

01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,500
on it on friday or so then get in

01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:31,510
contact with me and i haven't worked on

01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,940
all those modules alone many of the

01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:36,400
people are involved of course they've

01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:38,980
right through wrote and maintains most

01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,900
of those noodles into / 7 and the number

01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,350
of other people that are porting the

01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:46,830
token module and other modules and

01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:46,830
helping out

01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:07,760
minus on microphone any questions about

01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:10,489
the modules yeah poor young so how close

01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,620
are we to other generating tokens from

01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:14,480
type data because I really didn't want

01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:20,239
to write anymore token integrations

01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:22,460
anymore I'm not sure I basically just

01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:25,130
made the existing approaching talking

01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:26,900
about you work for now so it's not using

01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:30,710
type data yet it's just using the

01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:34,370
existing field API I know that the rules

01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:36,800
guys are looking into making total token

01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:39,739
generation from type daughter work it

01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:42,770
has been some approach in Drupal core to

01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:45,949
make that work but that didn't happen

01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:48,590
yet unfortunately so I'm kind of relying

01:29:45,949 --> 01:30:00,620
on the real little steam to improve the

01:29:48,590 --> 01:30:03,620
situation there okay thank you so next

01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:07,270
is a shared presentation simple news

01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:07,270
Miro and email

01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:28,239
so hello yes simple news not possibly

01:30:23,179 --> 01:30:32,000
not so popular as all the other modules

01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:36,560
oh that's that wasn't yes it's like

01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,739
number 90 or something and actually i

01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:43,580
got into charge of it from eric two and

01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:45,500
a half years ago and i'm happy to say

01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:49,010
that today basically my team is taking

01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:50,540
care of it especially even finally

01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,110
joined us and helped us parting it

01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:55,429
because let's say last year for instance

01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:57,440
there was not too much activity around

01:30:55,429 --> 01:30:58,969
it and for instance there was also a

01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,840
module called newsletter that has been

01:30:58,969 --> 01:31:06,590
started which seems now to be abundant

01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:09,020
and finally migrated to simple news back

01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:12,949
again when our version of Drupal 8 is

01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:16,190
ready now I said I'm founder of and

01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:19,400
assistance luckily we are working a lot

01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:20,630
of with Drupal 8 stuff since starting

01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,409
this week and pushed a lot of these

01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:26,510
modules you've seen and I said this is

01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:30,140
even folks actually a developer of one

01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:31,699
of our clients who joined the team and

01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:37,940
helped us supporting as a new

01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:41,659
contributor thank you ok as Mira sedim

01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:45,920
did most of the porting we started some

01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:48,650
months ago which changed a little bit

01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,800
the order because the first thing is

01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:55,219
that changes so what changed from Drupal

01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:57,620
7 to Drupal 8 we try to use all the

01:31:55,219 --> 01:31:59,929
Drupal 8 pattern like the configuration

01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:04,730
the entities the feasible entities and

01:31:59,929 --> 01:32:07,429
all that stuff so what was known until

01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:10,489
now the categories which is the

01:32:07,429 --> 01:32:16,130
newsletter itself is now a configuration

01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:18,260
config entity and we used also the

01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:21,920
principles of the entity reference so

01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:23,780
it's like enlarged entity reference we

01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:28,310
use these for the subscriptions and the

01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:30,470
issues and also the blocks we changed

01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:36,050
and we were using now they're dead and

01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:38,480
drupal 8 plug-in system as you can see

01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:40,670
here it's a little diagram where you

01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:44,630
know which what is a subscription what

01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:50,180
is an issue so that's just for the

01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:53,270
overview and here do you see the the

01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:56,780
block configuration pop-up for the

01:32:53,270 --> 01:33:00,080
moment because until now on d7 and for a

01:32:56,780 --> 01:33:02,030
simple news block you just enabled it on

01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:05,090
the newsletter itself so you had only

01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:09,200
this one block for the newsletter or

01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:12,980
there was some summarizing block for

01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:15,950
older newsletter and now with the the

01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:18,530
blogging system you can have as much

01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:21,800
blocks as you want and you can all work

01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:24,440
always select for which newsletter you

01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,470
would like to have this blog so you can

01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:33,830
activate one or n or how much however

01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:39,440
you want to the status of the project

01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:42,760
and we port it I would say most or about

01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:45,230
all the functionality that you hadn't d7

01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:48,650
in the first step it was just a row

01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:50,210
porting of what we had and you have all

01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:53,960
the configuration of the newsletter the

01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:55,580
settings the UI we did not yet do the

01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,910
views integration so you have just

01:33:55,580 --> 01:34:01,310
simple listings at the moment the blocks

01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:04,790
were ported as I said with the plugins

01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:07,940
the mail spool works the subscriber is

01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:11,590
now filled well we also did in the last

01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:15,550
few days colleague is working on

01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:17,630
personalization so he already did some

01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:19,490
synchronization of the subscriber and

01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:24,770
the users of like a first time last time

01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:27,680
this stuff and they're sending and stop

01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:29,770
stopping of a newsletter is already

01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:34,940
working so you can send around some

01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:38,150
default newsletters for those of you who

01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:40,760
know simple news or perhaps happy to

01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:42,140
read here stopping newsletter yes we

01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,020
have now a stop button

01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:47,450
you can stop sending your newsletter at

01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:50,090
the moment is just a rudimentary stop

01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:53,420
stopping deleting the male's out of

01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:57,290
spool and setting back to status but we

01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:59,150
will work on that too here is a little

01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:01,220
overview as I said it's just at the

01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:03,800
moment listing knob use integration of

01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:07,960
the newsletter itself you can edit it

01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:12,620
and you see on top also the Settings tab

01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:14,690
these are two examples so indeed it's

01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,530
the same example of a subscription block

01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:20,540
once you locked in the other ones not as

01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:23,960
you can see you can you have them check

01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:27,260
box of different newsletters then you

01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:29,120
have to subscribe over you and indeed

01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:30,980
it's an overview of the active

01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:33,230
subscriptions that's a problem we are

01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:35,600
also working on because you don't really

01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:38,330
have an overview of all subscribers

01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,370
cause when you unsubscribe somewhere and

01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:42,320
so you don't have an active subscription

01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:45,800
to something you're not listed anywhere

01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:47,570
so we will try to separate these two

01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,960
things that we have a subscriber

01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:53,420
overview and a subscription overview

01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:58,730
that it's it's handled easier or it's

01:35:53,420 --> 01:36:01,850
you you view it a lot lot better and

01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:04,220
this this is the subscriber edit form as

01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:07,310
you can see there are those fields first

01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:12,140
name last name which are synchronized to

01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:14,690
to the user which it depends on so this

01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:19,180
is where I think yesterday it started

01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:19,180
working so we making progress in that

01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:25,340
that's the feel double subscriber as I

01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:28,400
said we used also these principles and

01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:32,210
the subscriber is complete available you

01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,430
can put on whatever you want it makes it

01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:37,160
quite flexible and also for the use of

01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:39,050
san fran synchronization which all the

01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:41,090
fields with a Dorian put on a user can

01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:45,530
also be on a subscriber so the sense

01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:47,540
pronunciation works and this is the

01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:52,460
newsletter issue overview so the

01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:55,510
newsletter issue is the thing that is

01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:59,330
sent every regularly

01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:02,090
for the moment we don't have any BBS or

01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:04,250
filtering on that as I said also because

01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:07,190
of the view in use integration that is

01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:10,430
missing but as you can see the

01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:13,610
subscribers in the t7 we had a problem

01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:16,070
that indeed every issue of a news letter

01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:17,810
that was sent shalt the same number of

01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:20,630
subscriber number in this overview

01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:23,420
because it just was looking up how many

01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:25,370
are subscribed out so mentioned is we

01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:27,830
fixed also that that you can see how

01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:31,340
many subscribers or how many send

01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:35,140
newsletters were at this issue so you

01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:42,350
can also see the evolution of

01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:44,210
subscriptions to a newsletter yes here

01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:47,390
you can see the stop sending button that

01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:49,940
you have on an issue and that's the same

01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:52,460
possibility possibilities and as in d7

01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:58,370
where you can send you newsletters and

01:37:52,460 --> 01:38:00,170
test males and all that stuff and now we

01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:05,480
come to the plans and there I give the

01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:07,520
word back to me yes actually I would

01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:11,960
have expected some applause for the stop

01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,930
sending button because you can't imagine

01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:17,480
how many males possibly whispers the

01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:20,870
whole world with simple news and we

01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:23,660
really wanted to stop this issue same

01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:28,100
also with with other discussions around

01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:30,710
the architecture and this we identified

01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:33,200
the concept of a subscriber as they seen

01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:36,140
basically subscriber is kind of similar

01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,970
to a user but it's not the real user can

01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:41,450
log in but still they can kind of

01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:42,890
maintaining subscriptions so basically

01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:45,410
there has there's currently a little bit

01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:47,950
of discussion whether the subscriber as

01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:50,420
such should be separated and not

01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:54,890
basically really be a part of simple

01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:56,720
news internally and I don't know what we

01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:58,940
will work on that really but most

01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:02,060
importantly we want to improve the UI a

01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:05,170
bit that personalization stuff was a

01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:08,239
huge demanding past already so people

01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:12,409
basically ended up in cost

01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:13,789
amazing writing custom code to add first

01:39:12,409 --> 01:39:16,460
name or a last name field to

01:39:13,789 --> 01:39:18,889
subscriptions this pain is really over

01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:21,849
so basically we have a solution that is

01:39:18,889 --> 01:39:25,730
much more near to real life requirement

01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:29,469
and for instance I have really thinks

01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:32,809
that that I'm concerned about since

01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:36,199
Drupal currently is really bad at doing

01:39:32,809 --> 01:39:39,219
its male reputation so basically most of

01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:42,380
the platforms are sending emails to

01:39:39,219 --> 01:39:44,960
recipients that possibly bounce and no

01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:46,519
one is taking care of that this is not a

01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:50,300
simple newest problem in my point of

01:39:46,519 --> 01:39:53,630
view and we want to work on that we

01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:55,579
basically we start doing this and we

01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:58,999
will release I don't know some other

01:39:55,579 --> 01:40:01,489
modules components part of simple news

01:39:58,999 --> 01:40:04,130
on its own and sure there is always the

01:40:01,489 --> 01:40:07,039
topic like give me statistics provide

01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:11,449
click information on who actually

01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:15,460
clicked on links opened it and previous

01:40:11,449 --> 01:40:18,670
sub-modules might be ported might be

01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:22,400
part of simple use in the future and

01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:26,300
finally sure we want to provide examples

01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:29,510
through for instance simply test me one

01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:32,869
thing also i basically let's say start

01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:37,159
the dream years ago it's like best would

01:40:32,869 --> 01:40:39,260
be that every theme basically that ships

01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:43,280
with with drupal you can use should also

01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:45,499
provide an HTML main theme and we are

01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:49,730
far from that it's still something i

01:40:45,499 --> 01:40:52,579
want to basically get better with simple

01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:55,579
news because it it was always a pain to

01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:57,530
ship a theme that finally works for your

01:40:55,579 --> 01:41:03,230
newsletters and this is something we

01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:06,559
need to improve and we sure can we need

01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:09,079
your help even will continue we will

01:41:06,559 --> 01:41:11,480
make this production ready by start of

01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:14,749
next year basically symphonies can

01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:17,360
already be used we will may have some

01:41:14,749 --> 01:41:21,050
ideas where we continue to work as as i

01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,710
told you but still basically no one is

01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:25,130
currently taking

01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:29,060

01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:33,080
there's a ton of requirements that's

01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:35,300
basically start once you have these

01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:38,930
fields in order to successfully deliver

01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:43,340

01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:54,110
the old one that we had for drupal 7 is

01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:55,610
now taken by a nation and domain taker

01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:58,520
and but it will probably be another

01:42:55,610 --> 01:43:01,880
domain which is not yet ready and we're

01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:04,820

overview of all the updates of each

01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:08,660
