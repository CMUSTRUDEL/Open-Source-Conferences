Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Launching a Flagship eCommerce Site with Drupal and Drupal Commerce
Publication date: 2014-10-01
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: ikos
Lush is a UK based company that produces ethical and natural handmade cosmetics. They have over 900 stores in more than 50 countries and an annual turnover exceeding $600m

What?
The Lush Digital team has a vision of creating a Content Driven Commerce website where the stories and campaigns of the company are strongly linked with the products offered. Drupal and Drupal Commerce were selected as the ideal framework for fulfilling this vision.

How?
The branding and design of the website was being developed at the same time as the Drupal build was in progress so we used an agile development process with the design team ahead by one sprint. This allowed us to adapt the build as the design evolved.

One of the key success factors was developing the theme of the site in a Jekyll powered Style guide (or pattern guide). This enabled us to prototype and prove the design before moving to Drupal.

We developed an automated build process allowing a full site build on the development server each night.

Why?
Lush were developing a new digital platform for delivery across multiple regions. The UK site was the first of these to be rolled out. The site was intended to deliver the new company brand and experience across multiple devices.

Delivering Content and Commerce on a single platform was one of the deciding factors in selecting Drupal.

Who?
This project was developed by i-KOS in partnership with Method (Digital Agency), CommerceGuys (Technical Partner), Acquia (Infrastructure and Technical Partner).

When?
Development started in August 2013 with the first phase going live on 1st April 2014.

Result?
The site launched successfully 1st April and was a featured site in on www.awwwards.com and econsultancy.com.

This session highlights some of the approaches and systems used to develop the website and deconstructs the project to reveal some of the lessons learned.

In particular, we will talk about:

Using a live style guide for prototyping and theme development
Achieving complex page layouts in Drupal
Integration with third party systems - where best of breed can trump roll your own
Solr powered catalogues
Performance challenges
Finally we will discuss some of the key lessons that we hope will be beneficial to you when working on large scale multi-partner projects.

and so yo Ryan wasn't directly involved

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,930
in this project but this is a

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,140
partnership project that we did with the

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,350
Commerce guys so B and Ryan may have

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,149

may have questions coming through and

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,820
we'll have lots of time for questions at

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,289
the end from anyone so now I also feel

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,430
comfortable not having been involved in

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,250
the project to say that it's pretty

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,620
effing bridge just the sheer depth of

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,829
functionality that we just saw is pretty

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,030
pretty impressive so rich I don't know

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,949
your title in I costs other than owner

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,629
I'm the other guy pulling the strings on

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,519
the center director I costs yeah man

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,080
rich has been a longtime contributor to

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,030
drupal commerce with his team we've had

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,450
a great partnership to the last several

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,880
years maybe since 2010 I'm not sure and

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,320
so having supportive partners like I cos

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,420
is essential to the development of

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,799
Drupal Commerce and e-commerce ecosystem

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,200
and of course to commerce guys as a

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,220
company so really value you guys and

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,939
appreciate what you've done especially

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,909
with flagship sites like lush ok thank

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,979
you very much and said well the first

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,810
thing about lush that was brilliant is

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,210
that let us talk about it you do so many

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,650
of these sites and it has to be behind

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,570
closed doors you're not really allowed

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,520
to talk about how you've gone about it

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,939
sure everyone sort of experienced that

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,520
and so we'd lushed a pretty open company

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,939
and they're very happy for us to talk

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,619
about the project and so but if you've

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,479
never heard of them is let me just check

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,780
that first there's anyone who's actually

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,670
heard of lush who's outside of it ok

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,560
anyone outside of the UK I know miles

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,780
uses the lip scrub the sugar lips so so

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,509
lush lush digital been working with

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,410
their and a high street store very very

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,390
big store in the UK there are ethical

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,870
natural handmade cosmetics company in

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,600
the UK they sort of known as like the

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,670
bath bomb people that's their the key

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,640
product that everyone knows them for and

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,250
certainly when you go past one of their

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,010
stores you can smell it a mile away and

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:34,190
the combination of smells coming out of

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,240
there but is anyone we got involved that

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,400
we understood a little bit more about

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,800
this company and how much more there was

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,410
to them than just this sort bath bomb

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,380
store now they're they're based out the

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,300
UK but they do actually have well at the

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,250
time I wrote this slide nine hundred

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,420
plus stores in 50 different countries

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,040
around the world and a massive turnover

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,680
which is far exceeded what we what we

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,440
expected and for what we perceived that

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,940
company to be so there's a more than 600

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,320
million dollar turnover and I'm sure

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:09,050
that numbers out of date as well so we

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,930
got involved with lush in a joint joint

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,090
pitch with Commerce guys and and the

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,560
what they were trying to do when we

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,090
would present what they presented to us

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
what their vision was for what they were

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,140
trying to achieve with their website and

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,560
it was very much about what they've

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,720
called is now an industry term

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,230
content-driven Commerce and the idea of

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,110
this it's about mixing selling products

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,820
with the stories that go behind them so

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,740
gone are the days where you build a

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,170
brochure website and then strapped a

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,090
commerce site onto the side of it this

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,890
is now what we're seeing in the market

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,020
is all about merging these things

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,450
together making this the stories that

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,950
sell the products so people don't just

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,900
want to see list of products anymore and

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,340
press add to cart they want to know a

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,100
bit the background they want to know a

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,410
bit more about what's going on now with

00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,959
lush there as I say the very ethical

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,450
company they do a lot of charity work

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,190
they they have people out in the world

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,570
looking for ingredients ethically

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,180
sourcing ingredients and stuff like that

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,180
even smoking charity pot yeah

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,329
so they have got people out there and

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,340
they've got a good stories they've got

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,470
every ingredient that goes into these

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,930
products has a story that goes behind it

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,360
but where it might have come from maybe

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,520
the the farmers or the Fairtrade people

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,830
that have been working with it and so

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,520
this is a perfect brand to be able to do

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,139
this storytelling kind of e-commerce so

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,300
what we were looking for what they were

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,580
looking for was a way to merge together

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,100
their website stories and their

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,590
e-commerce and that's how we were able

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,539
to win the pitch really with drupal and

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,460
drupal commerce because it was they were

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,009
looking at the time at the big name

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,620
ecommerce brenders and but what we were

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,840
able to offer was the combination of

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,020
content and commerce within one platform

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,060
because Drupal commerce being you know a

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,190
set of modules that adds on to Drupal

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,690
Drupal has all the community content

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,380
management and everything else and the

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,150
extensibility and so that that gave us a

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,190
real edge being at being able to look at

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,169
it that way the other thing was of

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,449
course being open source it appealed to

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,310
their their ethics and they're two of

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,690
the way their company operates so that

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,150
was another big advantage for us so as

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,520
soon as you know this this site in

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,169
particular wasn't wasn't a one-man show

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,970
by any means we were working with

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,680
commerce guys from the beginning we also

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,110
working with a design agency called

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,539
method who are london-based agency so

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,539
they did all of the visual design and

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,099
interaction work and then of course we

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,050
were working with the lush digital team

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:48,780
in-house their own developers and their

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:50,789
own design team what I wanted to show

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,740
you today I want to break down this site

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,000
because I have the opportunity to tell

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,430
you a little bit more about what's under

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,530
the hood so I'm going to do a bit of a

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,330
deconstruction today and I want to talk

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,479
to you about the different elements of

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,820
how we built the site how we used a

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,030
pattern guide or a style guide depending

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,710
on what the trendy term is at the moment

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,210
how we built some particularly complex

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,449
page layouts and the techniques were

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,889
used how we did the search and catalog

00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:21,690
pages using apache solr and how we

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,080
integrate integrated lots of different

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,750
third-party systems to

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,970
into Drupal to provide the best

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,220
combination of features and then finally

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,530
a little bit about performance because

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,990
as you can imagine ecommerce sites need

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,210
to perform they need to be fast and this

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,150
particular one is under very high demand

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,129
there's lots of lots of traffic lots of

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,050
customers so I'm going to talk a little

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:47,710
bit about how we address those sorts of

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,870
performance issues and Ryan if you want

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,370
it mean to elaborate on anything just

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,780
that is the hard question because we've

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,639
got some time to do though so it was

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,610
really important on this site that the

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,360
design was done in collaboration with us

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,099
and there's a life we what we did in the

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,710
end was we developed a live patent guide

00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,110
this site needed to handle six break

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,210
points so it's incredibly detailed

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,080
responsive work and it wasn't so much

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,810
about you know mobile tablet desktop it

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,240
was very much the design will switch

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,849
depending on this on the size of the

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,469
browser you're looking at and we knew

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,960
this is going to be a massive amount of

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,520
work to do and we also knew that we had

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,190
a lot of work to do on the Drupal side

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,080
and we couldn't really wait to get the

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,819
Drupal stuff done and then start working

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,729
on the theme like maybe we traditionally

00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:42,909
would do and so we came up with this

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,529
we'd seen around people like Starbucks

00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,000
and they've got their dessert their

00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:49,300
style guides out there and we were

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,270
inspired by this and we decided to build

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:57,039
a style guide for lush outside of Drupal

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,319
and we ended up using Jekyll and and

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,909
what we were able to build was the

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,370
designs were coming to us in the

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:06,430
traditional way in Photoshop and we were

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,550
able to prototype those designs in in

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,020
Jekyll develop the concepts test out the

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,930
interaction stuff before we were

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,060
anywhere near drupal and Jekyll's had

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,680
only a recently familiar term to me so

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,440
know if you want to elaborate on exactly

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,690
what that is yes I guess Jekyll feels a

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,919
bit like going back to old school it's

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:30,250
like you it's a templating language but

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,430
which you can compile into HTML so it's

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,349
fast iterative development and it can

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,849
piles up so what we were able to do here

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,759
is build all the

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,639
individual modules of that as in design

00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,410
modules of the site in in this Jekyll

00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,060
system and it meant we could do the

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,399
cross browser testing early it meant we

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,470
could trial things and see how it's

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,209
going to work and because the designers

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,579
needed to see the staff the timings of

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,160
things and that sort of stuff but the

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:59,740
the key thing that we did differently

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,240
was that the people building this

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,720
pattern guide were actual drupal

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,699
developer Zoe I course developers who

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,350
knew what the sort of templates and the

00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:11,470
sort of markup that Drupal was going to

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,940
end up needing so we tried sometimes you

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,800
get a patent guide and it's delivered by

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,810
an external agency and you've just got

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,230
to work with it so the idea here was

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,019
that we we produce the style guide with

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,209
sort of sort of Drupal markup markup

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,339
that we knew is achievable in Drupal so

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,860
a lot of extra d'oeuvres and our classes

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,069
and loads of different everywhere and

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,660
but all class driven and it meant that

00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:36,399
what we can actually do is compile the

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,459
whole style guide and then copy it

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,690
straight over to the theme so and we

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,209
also were then able to take the

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,160
individual raw HTML elements and put

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,970
those into the theme as well so it gave

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,459
us this portability of the system so we

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,439
like to allow us to to do this the other

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,300
massive benefit to this is that it's a

00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,550
permanent reference so even though the

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,009
project is now live and obviously it's

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,019
in continuous evolution so everything is

00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:04,810
still trialed through this this style

00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,189
guide approach and I've got some I can

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,430
do a little demo of this in a minute and

00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,600
I've just taken some stills so that when

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,339
we upload the slides is actually

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,180
something there because the the style

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,670
guide itself is not actually public yet

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,410
so this just shows some different

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,120
elements of the site so the way we're

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,079
looking at it is you don't design an

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,880
entire page you design a product element

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,439
and this is what a product looks like in

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,000
this scenario and this is what it looks

00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:33,939
like on the wish list this is what it

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,040
looks like in the car so every single

00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:37,569
piece of content looks different in

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,149
different places and what we do is we

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:42,220
design those individual cases on their

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,990
own and then we're able to join all

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,760
those things together later to make a

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,880
complete page layout which I'll come on

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,590
to a little bit later so I'm just going

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,380
to switch over

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:59,530
he says this is where it gets fun

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:03,730
because I can't actually see what I'm

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,220
doing I have to stand up here and so

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,190
this is if i can find my find my

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,370
mouse pointer this is the style guide so

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,260
all of the elements that make up the

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,880
site will independently built outside

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,590
here and we also use this as a QA tool

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,900
so you'll see these green and red little

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,790
drupal icons which which are basically

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,460
part of a QA process to say this piece

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,740
is done this part is being reviewed and

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:39,100
so on so if we go into let's have a look

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:43,960
undefined sorry here we go the module

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:46,320
guide here this should be really fast

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,350
because it's supposed to be local but

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,380
there we go okay so what we're looking

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,980
here is this print this screen

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,780
resolution is really rather large but

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,820
each this is what your product looks

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,210
like in its featured mode than a normal

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,260
mode here and as we scroll down and we

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,710
can see what it looks like when there

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,350
are reviews sorry i refer else because

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,480
i'm not actually online there are images

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,030
here but on the resolution of that

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,990
screen the particular image is almost

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:22,300
transparent unfortunately and there we

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,850
go and then the same thing how that's

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:29,800
displayed in the wish list so if i try

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:32,220
and grab some pop of the browser and it

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,220
wrong didn't

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,959
I'm trying to be able to resize the

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,959
browser here

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,040
right so if we move a little bit further

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,180
back up again just take this one for

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,180
example and we move around we can just

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,230
see the responsive nature of the of the

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,070
site i think that's a good example

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:11,089
actually let's come up here hello a bit

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,470
so i can't show you the super wide

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,630
resolutions because this screen isn't

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,690
wide enough but you'll see that it

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,270
changes as we go to small sizes ready

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,760
for mobile tablet tablet landscape

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,740
tablet portrait and then as we go to the

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,960
full desktop Singh and you know things

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,290
flip around so we were able to try all

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,690
this stuff out and each individual

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,029
element that we built let's go back to

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,770
this and did you find a particular base

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,850
theme in Drupal was more suited to

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:44,000
porting the CSS and HTML from your style

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:48,170
guide into the drupal theme and last

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah we did use omega4 and but by the

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,210
time we've done there's so much work

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,940
done outside in this in the style guide

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:58,220
that i'm not sure how much i may before

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,580
did for us at that point it ended up

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:06,350
being quite custom and so but the way we

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:09,770
used the theme here we had this rather

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,910
complex page layouts so if you saw in

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,830
the video at the beginning i'll show you

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,420
another one in a minute when you go into

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,070
a product page there's a ton of

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,839
information about that product so you

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,850
first of all got the e-commerce element

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,380
then you've got information about the

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,860
ingredients that might be in it any

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,230
related news related products reviews

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,420
all this sort of stuff and it ends up

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,410
with a quite a massive amount of content

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,870
to render into one page now we had some

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,820
internal debate between all of us as to

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:42,350
what method to use whether to use panels

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:45,110
or contexts or whatever and in the end

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,230
we decided to use Drupal's built-in

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,339
functionality of view modes so normally

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,010
when you're building a site you will see

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,360
you've got to view modes at the box

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,250
you've got your default view mode which

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,010
is your full page and you've normally

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,080
got a teaser so what we decided to do

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,200
here for really for

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,380
mace the ease of understanding more than

00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,390
anything else was we defined additional

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,090
view modes for each of the method of

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,490
displaying the content so we might have

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:17,080
had a view mode for wish list and a view

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:19,220
mode for product detail a view mode for

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,940
e-commerce mode or something like that

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,710
and that allowed us to transfer that

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,800
data that we had in that style guide

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,230
those templates that were HTML and we

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,870
were able to use template suggestions to

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,970
decide to tell Drupal which of those

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,390
patterns to use for any particular

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,730
scenario and you know there are other

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,620
ways of doing this but we found this way

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,720
the most portable and understandable

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,010
because it meant that when someone was

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,650
looking at the page they could see

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,170
immediately it's not a ton of panels to

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,970
configure that one piece there is an

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,000
individual rendering of that particular

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,680
piece of content and did you use a

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,590
displaced we'd better find those view

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,020
modes or just custom yeah display suite

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,320
was absolutely the way we would go for

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,820
it and in the end we took we we did a

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,530
lot of configuration displacement and

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,360
then turned off the UI at the end and

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,690
because we needed a really strict

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,770
control on the mark-up to achieve what

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,780
we're trying to do with the SAR guide

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,060
the mark-up had to be spot-on and that

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,430
was the whole point so using something

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,210
like this place we allow us to allowed

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:29,450
us to do that yeah so this is an example

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:33,950
of one of those pages so this is a

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,180
product detail page and as I've look it

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,400
doesn't make it fun feel sick now I'm

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,010
moving around so you've got ingredients

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,460
directly underneath and then you've got

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:46,190
a story / had to cut by meter

00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,950
unfortunately and then we've got reviews

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,690
underneath that and then related to

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,150
content underneath that now all of those

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,130
are different renderings and different

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,080
display modes of the same piece of

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,380
content so what we've done there is

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,980
using Union context to stack them on top

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,780
of each other and to take this a little

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,520
bit further when you start looking at

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,720
this site and we break down the

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,230
individual elements what you're seeing

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,939
here is those modules sorry we keep

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,649
using the word modules in Drupal world

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,360
something different in these in the

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:19,669
design world they referred to as design

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,639
modules so the individual component

00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,839
design pieces of the site here you can

00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:28,490
see them we just lifted them out there

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,809
just for visualization purposes and yeah

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,850
this one here so that's showing an

00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,889
ingredient in that particular mode and

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,299
the way this design works you know we've

00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,590
got three ingredients but the first one

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,629
had to be slightly bigger than the other

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,340
two and it's all this sort of high

00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:42,230
detailed design stuff that we had to

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,720
meet these requirements for and this

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,419
method allowed to do that and another

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,519
one here we've got the different spa

00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:51,289
treatment shops they're different spars

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,259
they've got around the UK at the moment

00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:58,039
and so allowing us to you to open up

00:17:54,259 --> 00:18:00,679
those individual elements as well and

00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:03,230
then taking a little bit further this is

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,360
the the dashboard page of the site so

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,840
once the customers logged in and and

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,570
hear what we were able to do again is

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,299
not only view modes on content but also

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,059
view modes on orders and things like

00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:19,399
that so when you're looking at your list

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,659
of order history you can see them in one

00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,250
mode and if you're looking at them in

00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:24,529
the dashboard mode you want to see your

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,330
most recent order and so we just render

00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:30,110
it slightly differently and again we

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:34,190
were able to use these view modes to to

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:36,379
reflect that functionality as I said

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,970
you're barred a British nanny that's

00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:44,299
right yeah okay so that was how we

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,559
achieved our page layouts well if you

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,179
don't mind me asking I don't know how

00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,070
familiar everyone in the room is but in

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:51,679
Drupal commerce you have product data

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,909
separate from your product display and

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,259
so in here I'm not actually sure if

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,909
you're even using a product displayed

00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,220
nodetype if you're just pulling that all

00:18:55,909 --> 00:19:00,169
indirectly via context how did you

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,490
actually build up a product page and

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,899
then associate all of the different

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,600
ingredients and reviews and whatnot with

00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:07,370
that product so there's a lot there is a

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,080
product display so the product entity

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,909
itself is the part that you need to

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,220
fulfill the order so that's the skew the

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:15,889
short description the price and

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,419
everything else is actually in a product

00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:24,740
display content type we actually had 314

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:26,000
product one first are 14 gifts and they

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,360
just slightly different fields on each

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
one see ya

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,830
was it was a place of the traditional

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,330
model of drupal commerce how we would do

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,799
that but what we were also doing is

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,200
using a lot of entity referencing to

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,679
join all the other types of content

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:45,049
together whether it be ingredients for

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,049
example is all entity referenced across

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:52,350
right so the next thing we had to think

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,990
about was searched and everyone knows

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,540
really in any sight of any scale no one

00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,450
really uses core Drupal search because

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,610
it's it's not really optimized for that

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,549
sort of stuff so we were using apache

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,520
solr and now that was an obvious thing

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:11,640
to do for the main search but what we

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,640
also decided to do was use solar for the

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,950
category pages and the catalog and now

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,620
this was maybe slightly unusual but the

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,120
aim was even from the beginning we were

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,970
trying to bring out every ounce of

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,809
performance that we could and the way we

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,299
were able to use solar was if you if you

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,820
if you index your content in solar you

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,890
can actually pre-render using these view

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,390
modes that I discussed earlier and then

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,669
what that meant was that when we do a

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,460
search result page we don't have to do

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,960
anything in Drupal additional we don't

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,030
have to rerender content as it's coming

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,309
back and that was absolutely the fastest

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,710
way we could put together a search

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,540
results page so we were able to use this

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,460
for all of the catalog pages so when you

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,190
go to a list view like the top-level

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,190
bath or bath bombs or whatever those are

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:03,630
actually search results pages doing that

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:06,600
allowed us various various things that

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,980
we could do allowed us to influence the

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,980
order products which is something that

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,390
in vania invariably comes up and you can

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,520
of course do that with things like no

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,770
queue and but what we were able to do is

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,929
use some some waiting and rules within

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,030
within solar to influence how those

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:26,490
results were coming back and ultimately

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:28,290
it was all about performance and when

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,700
soon as you can see if I'm not mistaken

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,919
it sounds like what you've done then is

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,870
you you use Drupal as the content data

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,910
store but then you're rendering the

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,530
content and cashing it in solar and then

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,600
you sort of built a custom front end

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,830
still using Drupal but a custom front

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,080
into all of this Jubal

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,600
and with solar sort of being the back

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,950
and almost like a headless drupal before

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,549
there was a headless drupal kind of

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,779
scenarios in a way yeah we certainly

00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:54,899
probably didn't think of it in those

00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:57,059
terms but yeah we are cashing a great

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:59,039
deal of stuff inside solar so that we

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,260
don't have to rerender it and in terms

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,960
of the custom presentation of that this

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:07,289
a little bit of you know it's it's

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,870
standard using the apache solar module

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,580
you can define search pages so there was

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,639
some custom work but a lot of it was

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,500
actually already there yeah and was

00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,990
anybody at drupalcon Sigurd by any

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,380
chance some folks would you remember

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,360
Rasmus their doors talk he's the creator

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,820
of PHP and he did like about profile of

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,919
PHP to show like what what parts of

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,240
Drupal are the slowest and the fastest

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,159
and it's the rendering system that took

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,809
up like seventy percent of the page

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,639
requests that he was profiling so this

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,440
is cutting out a tremendous you know

00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:39,720
performance hit to every page load event

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,480
of a user on your science yeah I'm

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,429
impressed yeah so it allowed us to do a

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,139
few things actually the search is

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,019
significantly more powerful I mean not

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,639
for a category or categories just a list

00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,679
but for the for the main search on the

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:54,240
site you're expecting you know to be

00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,990
able to miss type terms their product

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,669
names are quite creative a lot of puns

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,260
going on so you want to be able to

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,690
search of stuff and get get results

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,190
coming up and so you've got much more

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,919
powerful much more accurate search we

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,299
also able to do faceted search very very

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,340
well which I'll show you in a second and

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,039
then the last piece that we used was

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,779
with geospatial search which is

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,870
something of course you can do in Drupal

00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,149
using lots of open-air openlayers and

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,490
various other Gio modules or bolted

00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,909
together and but actually Apache Solr

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,700
has G ok geosearch KPS facial search

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:32,429
capability anyway if you send it the

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,049
right request so we were able to say

00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:35,639
right the Drupal doesn't need to do any

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,610
of that stuff we can do all of that over

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:42,029
here and again take away say 10 modules

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,279
that we don't need so we were able to

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:47,100
use a Kree search for the category list

00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:50,070
page is the main search and the shop the

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,020
shop finder by using the the geospatial

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,639
search facility we're able to do the

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,210
shop finder that way and we were able to

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,490
pre

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,440
the results in more than one format as

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,360
you've seen already there are different

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,100
ways we can display stuff so what we

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,380
were able to do is pre-render as many as

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,650
we need it in that sort of go solar cash

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,210
layer and that gives you a result like

00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,140
this this is an example of a normal

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:15,960
category page they always have this

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,180
feature caption at the top and then

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,660
after that all of that it says is a

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,520
solar generated return so you can see

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,810
obviously with the five star rating and

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,540
and that sort of stuff we have to

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,400
refresh that solo index quite a lot but

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,720
whenever a part is updated or reviewed

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,970
or anything we just push another request

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,610
up to solar refresh the layer there and

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:39,810
then and then that works do any products

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:44,280
have less than four stars larissa well

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,360
then maybe some later but you know that

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,330
Leslie interesting thing at the

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,500
community of customers that this

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,670
particular brand has are quite

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,730
enthusiastic should we say they have a

00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,950
name they're called la she's and you

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,050
yeah like you would with Apple you do

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:05,030
get unboxing videos of lush products

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,050
going on so yeah these guys at kean and

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,460
let's just say if there's any problem so

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:13,290
let us know so this is an example of the

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,530
main set so we're able to use a faceted

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,060
search there at the top so basically

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,640
showing different ingredients product

00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,620
stories and shops because bath is a

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,800
place in the UK so not only is it a bath

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,140
bomb is also a shop and we were able to

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,420
use that view mode approach again to

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,130
render ok what does this piece of

00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,050
content look like when it comes up in

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,180
the search and then one additional thing

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,530
was what does this piece of content that

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,760
like when it's number one in the search

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,710
because it's bigger than all the others

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,160
so do la shoes have to be convinced to

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,770
bathe it looks like in the benefits of

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,180
bathing it maybe they're trying to get

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,830
into it multiple times a day I don't

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:56,280
know so that was searched and our next

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,600
challenge was thinking about all the

00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,370
other things that this I needed to do

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,050
they were pretty opt no not not too

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,760
missed it they're pretty ambitious is

00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,860
the word about what they were trying to

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,100
achieve with the with their new brand

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,980
and what we found

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,410
is that the temptation with Drupal is to

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,080
grab a module here build a custom module

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,640
here you can do it all course you can we

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,049
know that and that's what comes of

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,510
drupalcon is all about you can learn all

00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:24,570
these ways of doing stuff but that's not

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,280
always the best way because sometimes

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,750
you know what there is someone out there

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,669
doing a really good job of this

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,010
particular thing and isn't it better

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,230
just to integrate those in and I think

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,720
through not just this project but many

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,280
others we've learned that sometimes just

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,990
because you can do it in Drupal doesn't

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,659
necessarily mean it's the right thing to

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:47,330
do so with this particular site we were

00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:50,370
able to use lots of additional services

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:53,280
I'll just quickly run down them so you

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,710
know meta pack is an external shipping

00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,419
system so you can do shipping a drupal

00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,010
commerce just fine but if you're

00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,539
shipping all around the world and your

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,260
shipping rules are quite complicated

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,210
that's a lot of work to set them all up

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,510
meta pack is an external service where

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:12,299
you send a bundled up version of the

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,010
basket to an external API and it comes

00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,390
back and offers you what the shipping

00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,950
options are for that particular option

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,130
so it basically takes that whole piece

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,530
of work away and uses that they also

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,500
handle the comfort of consignment

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:28,980
shipping and that sort of thing postcode

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,830
anywhere is a uk-based post code lookup

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,970
system I think it's quite expected that

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,770
you indeed you would have something like

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,590
that and a career search we've already

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,210
mentioned you'll see not necessary

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,500
through my slides but through looking at

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,820
the site there's a lot of video work

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:48,390
going on and that's all encoded off site

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:52,169
using Zen coder we use Statler which is

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,299
a social API service and because we we

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,549
spent a lot of time with commerce guys

00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:59,970
working on integrating Twitter and

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,700
Instagram and Facebook and it was a

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,039
painful and anyone who's done that you

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,230
you just don't know when these guys are

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,600
going to change the rules on you so in

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,429
the end we decided to take that piece

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,309
away and integrate the third party

00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:16,950
service to just handle the social feeds

00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:18,419
and sharing stuff and we've got

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,440
recomendation API which is actually

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:23,300
nosco which is a partner

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,960
good my lettuce of course New Relic I'll

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,480
talk about shortly and Mullen we use for

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,110
the reviews anti-spam registration

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,360
standard stuff like that we use mandrel

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,630
for outgoing mail one of the downsides

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,860
of of sending mail through Drupal site

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,100
says you're never quite sure if it ever

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,650
went so mandrel is an API system

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,690
MailChimp that allows you to have

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,179
traceability with a mail sent which is

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,420
really important for you know ecommerce

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:55,130
order confirmations that sort of stuff

00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,600
and then they had their own order

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,570
management system which was a homespun

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,400
system which we were able to once we

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,280
finally get the orders done we send them

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,530
out to their on the other side and we're

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,880
using a clear hosting in this case so

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,800
there's varnish in there which is really

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,030
important we also use a service called

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,040
cloud inary which is a CDN for images

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,660
and it does pretty much what the drupal

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,540
image cache module does you send a nice

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,950
crafted URL and it brings back the

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,440
optimized image for you in the right

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,559
size and we use this in particular

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,000
because in our case it allows us to

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,610
share that library of images have

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,360
crossed multiple properties and also it

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,520
has some very clever additions like it

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,960
can do face detection so if you want to

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,130
do a customer blows their profile

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,070
picture and we want to do that little

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,330
circle then we can face detect where the

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,190
where the person's face is in the image

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,990
and we've got that nice little thing

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,920
otherwise we get their shoulder or

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,920
something depending on what they

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,720
uploaded and then on the front of that

00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:00,410
we've we've got cloudflare which I'll

00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:02,840
talk about next let's say performance is

00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:06,020
everything with this site with with any

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,150
site like this and this is you saw the

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,559
length of those pages you saw the weight

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,290
of stuff we're trying to deliver here

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,140
and so we've got a lot of caching going

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,640
on and e-commerce really needs to have

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,590
fast delivery and you need to keep an

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,390
eye on it so that was the thing you know

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,679
you've gotta know where bottlenecks are

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,100
you've got to be able to trace things

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,630
back so we use all the standard stuff he

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,760
would expect out of Drupal we use the

00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,460
drupal's internal cash we use the entity

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,890
cash module we use memcached all these

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,140
things and varnish particularly having a

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:38,060
reverse proxy cache at the front really

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,920
essential because it reduces the amount

00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,400
of traffic actually hitting the Drupal

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,250
stack all together but the thing is

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,770
whether commerce site it's really hard

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:51,440
caching is hard and there are so many

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,590
reasons that you can't cash so looking

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,300
at this example here this page just a

00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,120
normal product page and you would hope

00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,740
that you'd be able to cash that mostly

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,080
in its entirety but every single piece

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:06,050
of that whereof outlined in green I

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,570
can't cash yeah because it's

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,950
personalized it's the price maybe the

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,010
price is different for me maybe I'm a

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,750
member of staff and I get discount maybe

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,980
the items already on my wish list so

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,010
don't want that to wish list I one

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,460
removed from wish list maybe the product

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,930
sold out so I can't do add to basket and

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,480
up in the left hand that little speech

00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,500
bubble is actually the social feed so

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,930
that's obviously not going to be

00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,670
cashable either so there's so much stuff

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,140
and of course the basket on the right

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,840
hand side I can't catch that because

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,370
it's going to be different per customer

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,230
so that the additional problem you have

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,030
with a commerce site as opposed to

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,160
something else like a maybe a new site

00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,800
is that there's so many conditions where

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,480
you can't you can't get that performance

00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,560
enhancement you want because you can't

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,090
cash everything so that's where we've

00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,400
been working with that with cloudflare

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,460
and so cloudflare was brought into the

00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,190
project as a CDN because for PCI

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,020
compliance reasons lush needed a thing

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,060
called a web application firewall which

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,970
is just something that tracks everything

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,760
every single transaction that's going on

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:12,740
for just for compliance reasons but then

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,510
we we started to get more involved with

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,700
cloudflare working with the team there

00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:20,060
and realized that actually there's a lot

00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,730
more stuff you can cash if you're smart

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,710
about how you do it and we're pretty

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,840
early in the journey here but we were

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,730
able to cash Ajax requests for example

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,730
which we didn't realize before we're

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,710
also able to a lot the time we were

00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,750
doing lazy loading of things like the

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,450
cart so you pop the cart open in as a

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,070
short delay while it loads in so where

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,200
to do stuff like that but we're

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,320
investigating at the moment a mechanism

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,180
in CloudFlare called cash everything

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,650
which seems to my understanding of it

00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,050
there

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,910
some cloud player people here it seems

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,130
to ignore everything that Drupal says

00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,440
about caching and allow you to literally

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,110
cash the entire thing and then we're

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,750
looking into tricks like storing things

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,910
like my profile picture may be storing

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,430
that reference to that image in local

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:09,010
storage on the browser or in a cookie or

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,930
something so that we don't have to hit

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,880
Drupal you know the goal in the

00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,530
performance is not don't hit Drupal you

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,910
can make Drupal ready fast but if you

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,060
don't need them no need to go near it

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:21,880
then that's even better so it's a lot

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,740
about Ajax lazy loading and trying it

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,960
you know edge site includes it is a

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,310
technique but we've not the trouble

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,440
virtualizing closes you're just hitting

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,680
Drupal twice so you've not really got

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,120
any benefit so looking at these

00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,730
techniques is more advanced techniques

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,730
of caching is something that's been very

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,050
interesting but I guess the the most

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,480
important thing about all of that is

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,430
it's still quite early days on that but

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,290
you need to be able to see what's going

00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:50,560
on so the other thing that we've used

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,150
very extensively is New Relic and I know

00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,450
they're downstairs an exhibition hall

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,740
somewhere and so these guys it just

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,250
comes with that we're hosting anyway so

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,790
we managed to use that system but it

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,830
traces down your every web web

00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,780
transaction that's going on and you can

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,429
dig right into the detail of what's

00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,740
going on so this particular graph shows

00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:15,340
the total response time for the site the

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:17,440
the green part of the top is stuff

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,800
outside of Drupal like Facebook requests

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,450
and stuff the blue is memcache the

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,350
orangey brown calories database and then

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:28,330
the rest is PHP so you can look at what

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,490
your performance bottlenecks i'll write

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:33,100
do i need am i seeing too much database

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:36,880
access what can i do about that he's my

00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,740
PHP you know too too much and when I

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,140
first looked at this I was actually

00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,300
talking to Laura Jane and she was saying

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,909
well if you upgrade to PHP 5.5 we can

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,860
make that a little bit at the bottom

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,330
shrink and she was born it really did if

00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,450
we know that the difference between PHP

00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,090
5.3 and 5.5 is good but it was a massive

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,760
performance uplift that we saw for no

00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,770
effort whatsoever and so stuff like that

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,890
being able to drill down so New Relic

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,510
allows us to get

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,430
right in the middle of it and find out

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,980
exactly what database queries are

00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,950
causing us pain or exactly which modules

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:16,039
or hooks or whatever it is that's

00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:18,710
causing the trouble the additional part

00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,839
of course when you start cashing you've

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,539
got to think about purging which is the

00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,970
opposite of caching you need to be able

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:27,829
to figure out what to do in certain

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,740
scenarios like this one that's really

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:32,839
bad visibility there but that's is

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,819
currently unavailable on that product so

00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,349
I need to know that the moment that

00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:38,480
product goes out of stock or more

00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,460
importantly comes back into stock that

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,529
the cash is going to be cleared on that

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,720
so that the next customer comes along

00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:46,400
can actually buy it and so what we were

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,099
using is accommodation there's an expire

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,440
module and there's another module for a

00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,750
free hosting Kodak we have purged and

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,730
what that's doing is poking poking a

00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,799
hole back through varnish saying okay

00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,779
invalidate that particular piece there

00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:02,240
so using these things in combination

00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:04,220
allows us to avoid that scenario where

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,589
if you've got like a one hour or two

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,480
hour cash going on you've got customer

00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:09,799
on the phone saying no one can buy this

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,779
product no can buy this product so

00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:16,339
you've got to think about those sort of

00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:17,960
things as well the next pick me let Ryan

00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:21,430
talk about a little bit he doesn't know

00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,990
what it is and that's about the back end

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,609
see everything I've talked about so far

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,210
as the front end of the site and the

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:30,799
great customer facing stuff but also

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,480
there's a whole other team of people

00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:35,150
who've got to process these orders and

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,470
look after the site so what we've been

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,740
working on with Commerce guys most

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,029
lately is a new back-end system yeah

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,799
which oftentimes whenever you're

00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,660
building a new e-commerce side we talk

00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:47,180
about Drupal commerce is facilitating

00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,319
taylormade ecommerce and so you think

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,509
very much about what it looks like

00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:53,509
whenever it's you know in the browser on

00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:55,849
the front end to the customer but what

00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:57,440
you maybe think about last if you think

00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:59,509
about it at all is what's it like as a

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,789
merchant to actually use this interface

00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,559
on a day-to-day basis to administer

00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:05,960
orders facilitate customer service

00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,430
fulfill products and whatnot and so

00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,049
often you know often that's the last

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,450
thing somebody touches or they just

00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:13,890
don't touch it at all commerce kickstart

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:16,350
tried to be some

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,980
helpful using the commerce back office

00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:23,640
modules in implementing sort of a better

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,960
practices back in for for merchants then

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,970
you would get out of the box with Drupal

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,830
commerce but still every merchant has

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,230
just some unique knee that's slightly

00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,880
different from the last and so as part

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,490
of all of our projects and commerce guys

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,590
we do want to consider how can I tweak

00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,620
this view or change these rules in this

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,440
business logic to directly support my

00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,260
merchant as another very important in

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,240
user of the site I mean so I guess so

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,870
this is ongoing work still with lush is

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,720
the actual creation of a new nicely

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,850
themed and relevant back-end to lushes

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,140
customer service team I'm assuming this

00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,640
is also integrated with the order

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,230
management service order management

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,020
system that you know continues to be a

00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:07,290
back-and-forth thing you know I just had

00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,460
a okay yes at the end of my session

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,840
yesterday I just had a scenario where

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,520
somebody could actually use a custom

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,950
back in to help their merchant because

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,470
they were fulfilling products on an

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:19,410
order on a line item by line item basis

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,270
but wanted to have you know a line item

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,710
status field that was editable on the

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,810
back end and then visible on the front

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,770
and so a customer could see which of the

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,080
products and their order had been

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,460
fulfilled so far and so within Drupal

00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,760
because this whole back and interface

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,090
especially the line item list which is

00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,590
not present on the screen yet because

00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,310
the line item list is built using the

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,570
views module within Drupal commerce I

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,400
was able to say well you just need to

00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,440
add a new field to your line item type

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,780
exposed to this view on the back end

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,790
using editable fields so the merchant

00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,590
could come in and toggle the status of a

00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,420
products delivery on a line item basis

00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,980
and then on the front end where the

00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,240
customer would view the order at that

00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,150
view just to show the static

00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,800
representation of this field and he was

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,450
able to you know then build a custom

00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,370
fulfillment workflow using Drupal

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,110
commerce and about you know Tim clicks

00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,430
and so I know there's more to this work

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,380
here and all that you take that back

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,450
over rich but you know this is just sort

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,550
of a feature-rich you know targeted back

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,370
in for leche that ideally will be

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,870
abstract about and then shareable out as

00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,610
a sort of new reference back in

00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,810
implementation I guess one of the

00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,000
biggest problems we were trying to solve

00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,070
here was well first of all multiple

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
sites feeding into one common customer

00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,130
care interface so

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,660
I won't go into that today but this

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,789
we've got a sort of headless order

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,400
management system but the other thing

00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:37,680
was that with when you got a really busy

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,410
site the concept in Drupal commerce is

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,599
that an order or a car is an order just

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,210
of a different status so when you start

00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,779
adding two million carts to your system

00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:50,789
it really starts to slow down so what we

00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:52,410
were trying to do here what we found was

00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,960
one of the pain points of the site being

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,309
slow was actually the customer care team

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,170
looking for an order yeah and then what

00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,910
we'd find was that because the site agon

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,039
slow more customers would loan up to

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,140
have her help with their order and the

00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,539
whole thing would start to snowball so

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,309
our aim our aim here was not only to

00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,380
provide more functionality for the

00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:13,470
customer care team but also we've

00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,289
managed to integrate Drupal commerce

00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,970
with Search API and so that you when

00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,019
you're searching for orders you can

00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,910
pretty much search for anything that

00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:22,410
you've got from the customer whether it

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,779
be the postcode their name their order

00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,420
number whatever and because it isn't a

00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:30,480
solar you haven't got that additional

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,359
weight on top of on top of Drupal itself

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,680
takes that piece outside so that's using

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:41,849
a Search API and then we were able to do

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,239
that again isn't it and add additional

00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:47,309
functionality like look customers and

00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:51,809
the customer care need like being able

00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:53,789
to do refunds reissues this is an

00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:55,499
example of the reissue page if if an

00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,690
order never got there what and the

00:40:55,499 --> 00:41:01,200
customer phones up they will often

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:03,480
resend the order at no cost and so it's

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,819
being able to manipulate those orders

00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,980
very very quickly and just do the tasks

00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,769
that they need to do to fulfill their

00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,079
job every day did your UX team and I

00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:16,680
cast design them back in interview so we

00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,049
the UX I coughs worked with the customer

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:22,049
care team soakin and that was that Nick

00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:23,670
extensively worked with them on site

00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:25,650
just to make sure that they were really

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,480
happy because these guys we need to make

00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,400
sure they're happy and customer care for

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,039
lush is the most and the most important

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,150
thing and then we teamed up with with

00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,309
commerce house because we knew in this

00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,460
case there's a lot going on there's

00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,049
trying to make the commerce back end all

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,939
in one page is

00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:43,439
really tough so we've been working very

00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:46,199
closely with commerce cars on this

00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:50,640
particular one and if we still are we're

00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:53,549
not quite there and so just finally

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,449
before we go to questions maybe bringing

00:41:53,549 --> 00:42:00,390
out some of the lessons learned and the

00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:02,579
Jewish during this project so my first

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,949
one was New Relic call save your life

00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:08,160
and I'm not sponsored by New Relic but I

00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:10,499
love this product and it really did help

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,179
us when we had performance issues it

00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:14,400
helped us find them really quickly

00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,779
otherwise you know you can be with the

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,029
such a complex site there's so many

00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:19,920
interacting parts he like I don't know

00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:21,449
what's causing this problem New Relic

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,719
allowed us to pinpoint suffer really

00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:27,329
really quickly I think the next one was

00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,189
never never underestimate the complexity

00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:33,059
of the migration part so what we were

00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:37,400
doing here was migrating previous sites

00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:40,650
from multiple countries into a new site

00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:46,199
migrating a bespoke was slightly

00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:49,140
modified open cart system and it's just

00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,359
it's a big job no matter what and also

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,099
this sheer amount of data you could have

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,660
move and how long that really takes i

00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,869
think the full migration to go out for

00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,489
days to actually run into end and when

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:01,739
you suddenly realize you're going live

00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:04,739
on monday and it's thursday you better

00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:07,829
start that thing running so that was

00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:10,289
really important to plan that thinking

00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:12,209
about the build versus by building it is

00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:14,429
not always the best way i think i

00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:16,229
covered that earlier but knowing when

00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:18,089
when is the right time to spend a bit of

00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:21,719
money even though you might feel not

00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:24,209
obliged to do so keep your partner's

00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,189
close we worked really really closely

00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:28,739
with both Commerce guys and with method

00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:30,959
and with the lush team on this that

00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,369
certainly with the with the design team

00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:34,739
it's really important we were pretty

00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:36,509
much embedded in their offices and so

00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,189
that they could try that interactions

00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:40,709
and they understood what our pain points

00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:43,949
were and we understood how much they

00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:45,299
wanted their pixel perfection so it was

00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:46,529
really good to better work with them

00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:48,719
otherwise you know you have this thing

00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:49,829
where they finish their job they throw

00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,269
it over the fence and then no one's

00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,160
happy because you think you didn't

00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:56,880
really see the detail that they will

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,190
for next one year caching caching

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,089
yeah just accept that it's hard and

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:07,289
there's lots going on the next ones

00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:11,190
maybe not so obvious think about your

00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:13,109
country and think about custom what we

00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,700
found was that sometimes there was a

00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,619
piece of functionality there's a contrib

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,880
out there that would do that but that

00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:22,289
country might do 10 10 other things and

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,270
we had to be really careful not to

00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:26,849
overload the site with stuff that we

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,319
just didn't need so Oh quite a lot the

00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:30,450
time we were looking at a contracting

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,069
like for example wish list there's a

00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,200
wish list akan trip out there but didn't

00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:36,690
be quite what we wanted so we ended up

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,210
using flag and some custom work on that

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,130
so it we just found that just because

00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,020
there's a contrib it doesn't necessarily

00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,760
mean it's the right fit so it's

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,950
basically spending time if any weight

00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,349
and figuring out what's the right thing

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:51,990
and next one's remembering the legacy

00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:53,640
especially for an agency who's going to

00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,490
be picking this thing up who's going to

00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,250
look after in a long term you know in

00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,020
our in our situation we've got to

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,190
remember the in-house team we've got to

00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,260
remember that these guys going to be

00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:07,559
looking after it so we ideally want them

00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,210
involved and also obviously we want them

00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,279
to understand what we've done so we

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:16,260
don't just arrived on launch day and say

00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:19,400
there you go have fun and then the next

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,630
thing yeah the last thing really try it

00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,130
when you're with moving in a fast-moving

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,539
environment these guys they had a launch

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,930
date that launched st. wasn't going to

00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:30,869
move we had to get this stuff out there

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,490
but we had to think about what was going

00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:34,049
to come post-launch there was a ton of

00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,150
features that we didn't quite get ready

00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:38,819
in time but we knew what they wanted to

00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:41,789
do so it's all about planning for that

00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:44,250
but if you spend all your time planning

00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:46,339
and figuring out oh well if we do it

00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,839
this way we've got to worry about that

00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:50,520
that's coming next and that's a

00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,160
perfectly valid to do but if you do it

00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,930
too much you never launch so what we

00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,400
have to do is like we've got a plan

00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,319
we've got to think about tomorrow but we

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,180
don't want / engineer everything that

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,329
it's okay to come back and change some

00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:06,270
stuff later in the next iteration so

00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:07,150
those are our lessons there's a lot

00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,040
going on here a lot

00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,150
lots of stuff to talk about and we love

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,800
talking about this project and it's

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,000
great to be able to talk about it with

00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,800
with with with Ryan as well so and any

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,350
questions or anything were open to the

00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:31,120
floor the mics in the middle there thank

00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:34,000
you very much I left you room for

00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,920
questions now yeah otherwise Ryan would

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,400
just keep talking hi do you guys come

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:48,190
out to the white do you've got because

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:49,360
of the recording I'll repeat this

00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:56,040
question is why are you making me work

00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:58,090
with this TV microphone yeah sorry yeah

00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,620
well first of all thank you very much is

00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,050
really good to take a detailed look at

00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,370
an excellent site like this I was

00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,890
wondering if it's possible for us to

00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:08,650
have a deeper look maybe at the actual

00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:10,990
forms for creating and editing the

00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,940
products on the site and that's

00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:16,360
something you yep I could I can do that

00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,370
maybe not live but I can probably do

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,320
that in our stand maybe later that's all

00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,850
right and because yeah this I can

00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,400
definitely show you the back end how

00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:27,250
it's working for editing products I am a

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,570
I can't quite do not a live demo but as

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,090
you saw how much trouble I was having

00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,820
earlier then by all means we'll catch up

00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:36,040
yeah how did you implement customer

00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,700
reviews and that comes up girlie often

00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:42,180
okay so yeah customer reviews was it's

00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:47,890
just a custom content type okay using

00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:50,740
five star and flag so we use flag for

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:54,460
the report as inappropriate and the like

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:56,590
and don't like part of the review five

00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:00,250
star for the stars obviously it expects

00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:03,070
and then we used entity reference to

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,080
refer them backwards to the product so

00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,390
pretty standard Drupal components

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,550
actually for that and probably a little

00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,310
bit of because of the way we had to do

00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,620
that the most popular theme the most

00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,890
popular review the most recent review

00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,640
and the top rated one for example we had

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,709
to do some some work in voting API to

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:33,359
recalculate all those sums on kron and

00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:33,359
supply that cool any others

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,970
however guess we call it oh we got one

00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,970
more

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,609
hi I am yea verily good talk looks like

00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,490
a really complicated e-commerce site

00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:51,750
obviously so how difficult was it to

00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,609
define the requirements of a client

00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,270
getting you had a fixed deadline to work

00:48:53,609 --> 00:49:00,260
towards so this was an agile project we

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:04,830
were working to an MVP although that

00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:08,280
became a bit of an in-joke as MVP meant

00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,720
everything so no but we were working on

00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,550
agile process so we was in two week

00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,750
iterations demos at the end of each and

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,190
although we weren't launching anything

00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,050
between those iterations it was very

00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,500
much keeping the client and the design

00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:24,000
team in touch with what was going on

00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,200
making sure that we were working on the

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,690
critical path of e-commerce

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,910
functionality first and then all the

00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,580
associated story stuff so yeah this is a

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:36,330
this is a pretty good agile agile based

00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,980
case study as well and and highlighting

00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:40,170
the importance of colocation in that

00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,670
sort of scenario as well she's not

00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,099
something that I normally think is

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:47,700
hugely important but in this case it was

00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:49,770
really good to have Drupal developers

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,300
with the agency working on the

00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,369
interaction and making sure that

00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,550
everyone knew what everyone else was

00:49:53,369 --> 00:50:02,130
going through at that point so yeah

00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:05,520
thank you hi yeah sorry go on listen

00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:07,800
yeah it's great a great case study so

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,730
thank you first I was wondering if you

00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,670
could talk a little bit about the

00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:13,980
mapping integration that you did and are

00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:16,440
you actually doing anything with the

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:19,430
inventory music going back to the actual

00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,440
stores where things are available ok so

00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:26,099
the mapping was open layers with a

00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:30,390
custom google google maps overlay a

00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:32,310
custom style set and the as i said to

00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,320
you that the actual content is delivered

00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:36,839
from solar so what we were doing is a

00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:40,349
custom no no it wasn't personal it there

00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:42,480
is a way to present solar geospatial

00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:44,670
results in openlayers it needed a little

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,780
bit of a tweak but generally what we're

00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,420
doing there is spring the results

00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,520
straight back and then we're displaying

00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,609
them like a normal local mayor's map so

00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,130
all of this is a lot of it is slightly

00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:59,450
tweaked but the fundamentals

00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:01,470
you know Drupal the way it should be

00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,540
sorry there was another follow that

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:05,760
wasn't there sorry i'll come back to the

00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:09,060
other one in a sec i was just wondering

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,850
is to usual christian but who are you

00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,130
competing with our Foolish whether using

00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,590
drupal already or did you know fighting

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:20,490
against time way or other they weren't

00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:23,610
using drupal yet and we were considered

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:26,160
the wild card i think i think it's fair

00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:30,270
to say and we were competing against

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,980
miles here and you remind me yeah

00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:34,650
Demandware and magento were the main

00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,840
competition in the pitch we were last in

00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:39,750
and but i think because we were able to

00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,360
offer that unified vision of one system

00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,230
doing everything it was really something

00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,280
that they were looking for when i

00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,590
realized i could do and so yeah I think

00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,090
it certainly made them feel like it was

00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:53,610
worth that fort worth taking the

00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,870
direction of Drupal I think there and

00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:58,010
now they're flipping all of their

00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,850
properties so must have been okay and

00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:02,370
sorry the other question was about

00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,930
inventory and I didn't go into that

00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,910
that's a whole nother story but that

00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:09,180
they do have a thing for the kitchen

00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:11,130
which is limited around products and the

00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,260
way they work is that they do a limited

00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,090
batch out of the actual kitchen they

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,670
make up two hundred of something of

00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:20,610
products and they sell them out for that

00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:22,650
one day and as I mentioned the lush is

00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,480
out there know what's coming this week

00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,830
they tweet out what's coming and there's

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,660
massive demand for these products in the

00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,430
short space of time so what we've had to

00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,940
build for them is a stock reservation

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,170
system so what it does we've had a

00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,100
couple of protease but the one we've got

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:40,290
currently it it works a bit like a deli

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,260
counter so you get a product you take a

00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:45,780
ticket and that you get half an hour to

00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,390
finish check out and if you don't your

00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,680
ticket self-destructs and then you might

00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,330
be able to get the product you might not

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,700
depends whether it's got anything left

00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:56,340
so we started off with the common stock

00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,440
module and but we weren't able to get

00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,910
that working super reliably with that

00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,240
type of concept so we've ended up

00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:06,630
building a custom stock reservation

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:09,310
system which may be our speaker Ryan may

00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:13,120
be worthy of going into con trip and

00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:14,770
so yeah it's but the the actual physical

00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,650
stock is held by the external system so

00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:19,540
we're doing a lot of web services chat

00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:22,570
to figure out what's in stock at any one

00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,100
point and lots of caching of that and

00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,380
the last thing we've done is adaptive

00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,150
caching so when we're checking for stock

00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,560
levels if we know that there weren't

00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,350
many left will check more frequently

00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,360
whereas if we know there's 10,000 then

00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,130
we'd probably not check till tomorrow so

00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,050
again just a little little performance

00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:48,070
things like that trying to figure out

00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:50,350
what we're doing it yeah sure do they

00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,990
have a multiple well system or just one

00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,820
in the UK and global world yeah there is

00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,760
a single warehouse at the moment yeah

00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:01,180
and can people buy and collect in stores

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,520
as well no not yet it's on the map it's

00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,010
on the road map we're not doing that yet

00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,470
moment we're in the process of launching

00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:10,690
the Dutch site and the and the other

00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:13,390
European sites so that's taken priority

00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:17,050
at the moment over new features so very

00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:19,450
soon we'll have pan-european sites that

00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:21,820
look like this one the ones that look if

00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,870
you look at the dutch spanish and other

00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,020
European sites at the moment they're

00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:28,780
using their old conceptual design and I

00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:30,460
just found out actually Brazil launched

00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:32,020
this morning and which is a great

00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,320
achievement for the team out there

00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:38,230
working with something it's a good story

00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,850
that i went to the code sprint with ryan

00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,460
back in a couple of years ago drupal

00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:45,310
commerce and met a developer from brazil

00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,450
and i'll only have really met him once

00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,250
but you seem like a good guy and he

00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,230
seemed to know his stuff and so lush

00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,990
asked us ok do you know anyone in brazil

00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:54,910
to help the launch so we found this guy

00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:56,500
up and he's been working there for last

00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,840
six months and he's just finished launch

00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,760
it so he was using you know he's

00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,470
basically been following along behind us

00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,330
taking the features as we build them and

00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:07,710
doing a lot of portuguese translation

00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:10,990
obviously and so yeah really nice little

00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:12,520
inner story there that worth going to

00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:17,780
drupal camps and drupal co springs you

00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:19,610
never know what might happen ok

00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,970
maybe last one and then one called time

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,970
yes

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,670
is it a drupal distribution and if it is

00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:34,890
Drupal distribution is it free okay so

00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,859
this is not a distribution specifically

00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:39,869
I it's there's a few bits of custom work

00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:42,900
that we've done what quite a lot I guess

00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:45,240
and but most of it is off the shelf

00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,359
country modules so there's not a

00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,529
distribution that holds it all together

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,880
but all the component parts are out

00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:53,640
there and all the component parts are

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,339
free and we've been able to build where

00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,230
we've done a couple of new modules those

00:55:56,339 --> 00:56:00,420
have gone out into into the community

00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:03,599
and we've got about three or four other

00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,920
modules that are probably candidates for

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,890
going out like the one I just mentioned

00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,890
so although there's some custom work in

00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:15,329
here most of it the majority of it is

00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:17,940
out there for anyone and sorry guys I

00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:19,680
think our time is up now so thank you

00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,359
very much I'm around for the whole week

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,529
anyway we've got a booth if you want to

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,660
come and chat anymore about any of this

00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:27,650
and commerce guys obviously here as well

00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,650
