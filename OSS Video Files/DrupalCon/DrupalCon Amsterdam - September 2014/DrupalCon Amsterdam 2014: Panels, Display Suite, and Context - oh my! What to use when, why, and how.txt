Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Panels, Display Suite, and Context - oh my! What to use when, why, and how
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: ohthehugemanatee
Drupal has a whole ecosystem of modules to help you with layout. Which one do you use? There are Display Suite die-hards, Context converts, Panels proselytizers, and even people who swear by Core's built in template/block system. Who's right? Which layout system should YOU use?

In this session you'll learn that the answer is "all of the above". Each layout system has unique strengths and weaknesses; you'll learn to combine them to maximize those strengths! We will discuss and demonstrate the three major approaches, highlighting the best use cases for each and ways they can be combined. We will cover extensions to each module such as Panelizer and Field Group, and when those can be helpful as well. Finally we will review some case studies where a combined approach has improved maintainability while reducing setup time.

You will leave this session with an in-depth understanding of major layout concepts in Drupal, and with some practical experience in combining them for optimum effect. Why restrict yourself to one layout system when you can use them all!

good morning everybody in only one

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,410
person good morning everybody that was

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,389
just great thank you heartwarming in

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,420
traditional DrupalCon fashion we're

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,100
starting a little bit behind here today

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,109
also in traditional DrupalCon fashion

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,710
there's a lot of information to cover

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,539
here so on the one hand I'm going to try

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,820
and move through things quickly but on

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,980
the other hand especially since this is

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,080
a session that's for people to start to

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,059
understand the possibilities here I

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,250
really want you to interrupt me with

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,690
questions if you have them just stick

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,690
your hand high in the air if you have a

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,760
question the only thing is I need you to

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,620
get to one of the microphones to ask the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,300
question and it's not because I can't

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,890
hear you and it's not because our

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,250
friends here and the audience can't hear

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,379
you

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,760
we're all just fine it's for all of the

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,370
millions of people who are watching

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,739
breathlessly on YouTube breathlessly

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,680
alright welcome to panels display suite

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,640
and context oh my how many people here

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,170
are familiar with The Wizard of Oz

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,909
excellent oh and you know I'm never sure

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,409
which cultural references will work and

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,020
which ones won't so I'm happy this one

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,990
will be okay so first of all an

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,810
introduction my name is Campbell vertice

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,189
I work for forum 1 and I've been a

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,830
Drupal is for nine years still scary

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,810
every time I say that I've been lucky

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,880
enough to work on sites for big

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,380
nonprofits and got non-government

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,030
organizations and some government

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
organizations it tends to be my

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,400
specialty so I do sites for people like

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,119
Mozilla the German Marshall Fund the

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,060
United Way the tools that I'm going to

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,810
be talking to you about today are

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,950
absolutely my bread and butter

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,020
they are as much as I can give credit to

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,780
specific modules for making my life

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,170
easier being able to combine these

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:04,350
modules intelligently is really how I is

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:07,020
really how I make my living so first of

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,170
all this is a confusing area to talk

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,730
about there are lots of complicated big

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,690
complicated modules involved here

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:21,050
there is the core block system there is

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,140
context there is panels there is display

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,500
suite and there are extensions and

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,209
customizations on each one of those

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,770
things like panelizer field group

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:35,150
contacts plugins and lots more it's

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,530
actually quite a lot for you to get your

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:43,880
head around there's also a bit of a turf

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:51,560
war involved in layouts layout is the

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:53,780
job of the themer right hands up

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,739
everybody here who is a themer primarily

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:01,970
I shouldn't put my hand up hands up

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:04,130
everybody who is a coder primarily yeah

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,790
interesting thing about layouts is that

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,200
it kind of belongs to both of us so we

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,600
fight about it a lot

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,660
people get legitimately upset about this

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,880
stuff I'm actually gonna give a whole

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,750
talk about this on Thursday morning at

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,610
10:45 in the big room I'm gonna uh I'm

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:27,260
gonna kick some femur butt all right all

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:35,180
of you coders make sure you're there on

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:38,840
Thursday morning my session I don't want

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:46,370
your kind here Adam Duran everybody

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:51,220
little hand you're going down it's the

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,720
Batman voice right back to this talk

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,859
part of what's tricky about this is that

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,209
there's a lot of people out there who

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,100
are gonna tell you what you should use

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,709
and how and this is an open-source

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,239
community which means that in

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:08,780
open-source opinions are like

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,390
bellybuttons everybody has one there are

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,820
lots of blog posts and articles about

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,310
how to do layouts exactly right for

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,500
every single site using just one of

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,900
these modules in fact just last week

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,300
there was this reddit post about exactly

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,590
this subject I thought I had to include

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,419
at least a screenshot of it but we're

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,949
going to look

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,629
some of the top comments here for a

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:34,960
sampling of the kind of advice that you

00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:37,539
get so a be web us writes custom theming

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,099
plus hook block lists and info and alter

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,039
as may be needed for all the more

00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:46,719
complex layout logics so this guy all he

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:48,219
uses is core blocks hands up everybody

00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,090
here who does their work with just

00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:57,539
Drupal core blocks hands up if you are a

00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:00,849
be web us I mean I got a check right

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,289
right below him stank will eyes are fart

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,500
I love it that we have to say this with

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:07,509
some dignity right stank eliezer fart

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,639
says that display sweet seems to do

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,340
about 80% of the heavy lifting for him

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,680
or her so it makes sense for me to keep

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,689
as much there as I reasonably can hands

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,229
up everybody who uses display suite

00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:22,509
primarily who's interesting when we get

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:27,339
to the gang war later on the block guys

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:30,849
have better bring zip guns doobly-doo

00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:33,339
Dow Boyle likes to do things with custom

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,550
code with Tao specifically of one of the

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:39,490
one of the great base themes he finds

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,449
display sweet to be slow and voice of

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,250
experience says that he prefers panels

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,169
per component passion caching and the

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,419
ability to fall back to DS main sites

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,699
are easy to maintain and very fast to

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:55,120
use hands up everybody who uses panels

00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,409
primarily hands up everybody who thinks

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,409
that panels is fast

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:07,539
I like you right it's an unusual thing

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:09,250
to say about panels the problem is that

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,389
on the internet everybody has an opinion

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,069
and everyone thinks that they know

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,139
what's best for your site and in reality

00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,940
there's only one person who knows all of

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,860
your needs perfectly and who can advise

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,860
you on exactly what to do and that's me

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,210
but seriously since Drupal is an open

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,039
source community there's lots of advice

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,300
about how to do layouts right and none

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,630
of it is gonna be right in every

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,030
circumstance so my objective here is to

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,099
help you understand the major tools and

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,080
when to use them what they're good at

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,770
what they're bad at what are the edge

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,599
cases that they can sort of manage and

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,639
the end point is that you should build

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,560
your next website somewhere a little bit

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,030
safer than beside a tornado that you can

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,789
make some intelligent decisions about

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:56,199
how to mix and match so I'm gonna help

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,740
you make sense of the crazy world of

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,090
layouts in d7 but before we go it's

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,909
important to remember that the goal is

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,830
not just something that works I know

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:08,199
that the goal for most people who are

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,270
starting out in Drupal is just something

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,860
that works cuz it's complicated but we

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,259
actually want something that's a bit

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,300
more than that so the objectives that

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,909
we're going to evaluate with each one of

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,409
these systems not only what does it do

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,570
and what does it not do and what does it

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,219
do well and what does it do badly but

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,219
we're really interested in having it

00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,469
minimize complexity we want to avoid

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,840
unnecessary modules whenever possible

00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,250
every time you add a module to your site

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,169
you're increasing the amount of memory

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,550
that that you need to run the site

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,650
you're increasing the amount of

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,740
complexity that you have to deal with as

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,050
a site maintainer there are lots of

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,090
downsides to having unnecessary crap

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,000
running and we're going to really try to

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,800
avoid that also complexity in terms of

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,110
the you of the administrator interface

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,430
is something that's really important to

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,020
consider we're going to try and use

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,650
systems that have and make it easy for

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,090
you to have repeatable patterns so that

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,159
when someone when someone else is

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,159
looking at your website they don't have

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:12,139
to guess on every single page layout how

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,639
did this person build it what bizarre

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,310
Lovecraftian horror combination of

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,350
modules to this guy use here we really

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,449
want repeatable patterns and maximum

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,340
transparency so that it's clear and

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,550
obvious for the next site maintainer to

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,060
understand we want to use repeatable

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,710
patterns and maximize transparency so

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,020
that whatever you do it's clear and

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,169
obvious for the next site maintainer to

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,240
understand we also want to incorporate

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:43,260
cats because we're from the internet and

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,209
that's important so we're gonna start

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,760
with Drupal core block system I'll move

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:52,500
pretty quickly through this one so who

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,510
here has used core blocks I am surprised

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,890
by everybody who here has not used core

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:01,260
blocks okay that's actually very

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:07,560
interesting I was expecting those guys

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:11,220
to be not awake can I have a volunteer

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,470
to tell me what is the core block system

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,709
like actually just start shouting out

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,440
individual words that's totally cool

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:26,779
fast slow overwhelming that's a great

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:33,510
one easy unwieldy that's even better

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:34,709
limited backward workflow yeah core

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,740
blocks is one of the things that we

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,270
talked about building from the roof down

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,220
interesting

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,140
all right so core blocks is the right

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,270
place to start for most people obviously

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,310
it's included in Drupal core so we most

00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,110
of us get a chance to use it so it's

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,670
very simple I'm gonna run through this

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,220
but in your theme you list your block

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,990
regions in your themes info file you

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,670
just mark out what are the names of

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,740
these regions and then in your template

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:03,390
files you just put little placeholders

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,950
PHP print sidebar left totally easy to

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,700
understand if you can understand the

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,410
surrounding HTML in your code you make a

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,690
list of blocks that you're going to have

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,190
in hook block info and you write the

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,709
actual code to make them appear with

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,140
hook block view it's fantastic it's easy

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:22,260
it's simple it's all done in time for

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,990
tea all you have to do is deal with the

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,700
block admin form

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,560
so this is this real screenshot from a

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,600
real site that I built this year more

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,540
than three hundred blocks all listed on

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,920
one screen I think we're oh I see we're

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,990
missing a little bit of one side here

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,930
but we're uh we're somewhere between the

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,760
ease and the apps here 300 blocks on one

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,470
form and it's drag-and-drop and it's

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:49,760
easy right maybe we won't have t quite

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,070
as soon as we thought but that's okay

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,570
cuz it's great for complex sitemaps with

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,490
lots of different layouts right well

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,220
only if you're okay with having a lot of

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,320
theme regions this is the dot info file

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,090
from Bartok one of our core themes

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,310
that's supposed to be the demonstration

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,380
of how you do this

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:13,490
Bartok does a good job if you only have

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:16,340
one page layout ever it has 16 block

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,310
regions to do that job so a simple use

00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,290
case done well it's more or less 16

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,390
block regions you had better be prepared

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,880
to work with a lot more if you're gonna

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,780
build any kind of complexity or complex

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:33,350
varying layouts into your website I

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:37,880
would not advise T at this point yeah

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,140
that's that's legible right yes so this

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,550
is the only system I'm not going to

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,050
bother to demonstrate because we've all

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,540
used it already we're just gonna jump

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,950
right to the pros and cons in the pros

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,080
column it's in core that's actually a

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,030
big deal as far as reducing complexity

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,180
and making things transparent it really

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,250
doesn't get any better than this core

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,100
modules only is a valid legitimate

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,810
approach because it's in core it

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,330
integrates well with lots of different

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,850
modules especially including views this

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,950
is another important note it's one thing

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,570
to produce a fantastic custom layout

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,560
module it's another thing to have it

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:18,130
work with anything else in the ecosystem

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,130
it's in core

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:27,949
but it's it's in core I really started

00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:32,029
to run out of pros here cons it's

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:34,730
unmaintainable in the UI it is difficult

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,259
to maintain in features or in code this

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,389
is a bit of a tricky one you can export

00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:43,819
some block information into features if

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:47,180
you use the features extra add-on module

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:49,430
which works most of the time and there's

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,499
no dependency detection there's no

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,629
guarantee that the blocks will be there

00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:56,779
or the the theme regions are going to be

00:12:53,629 --> 00:13:00,079
there and if you are actually declaring

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,300
your your blocks in custom code it's an

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,309
even bigger pain in the butt

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,769
to not have an easy way to export

00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:09,170
changes I've actually seen shops that do

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,209
core blocks only and they disable the

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,009
entire admin interface for blocks

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,379
because they're so worried about

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,970
somebody some developer going in and

00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:20,800
moving a block to a different region and

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:25,670
it's just really hard to keep track of

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,470
it's not particularly flexible I've lost

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,709
my mouse cursor it's not particularly

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,839
flexible it is hard to add themed

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,639
regions or layouts to an existing theme

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,529
without a fair bit of work once you've

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,769
built 90% of the site and the site and

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:42,319
they and the client says hey I want this

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:46,069
other cool page that's totally critical

00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:49,100
before launch you actually have to do

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:51,110
quite a bit of reengineering flexibility

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,699
is one of the great strengths of almost

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,170
actually of all of the other systems

00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,850
that we're going to look at today I

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,790
think it's one of the primary failings

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,949
of the block system and so we're gonna

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,949
get a good sense of how this falls down

00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:08,360
that's right only simple display logic

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,069
is allowed so core blocks we all know it

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,199
will let you choose whether your block

00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:14,720
should display yes or no based on

00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:17,929
content type based on path you can even

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,449
include some complicated logic using PHP

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:23,980
if you want and you can even do that in

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,980
the UI if you want to go to hell

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,360
we have very few Commandments in Drupal

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,780
but code in the database is definitely a

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,230
big one the big problem is you can't

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,810
reuse blocks and reusing regions on

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,340
multiple pages gets really difficult you

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,380
know what if you want that user login

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,690
block on top on the front page but on

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,150
the bottom of a totally different theme

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,800
region on another page you actually

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,750
can't do that with core blocks without

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,770
building a duplicate block and therefore

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:57,560
doubling what you have to maintain so in

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,210
our rating system assuming that you can

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,150
get core blocks to do what you want

00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:05,210
it's definitely simple

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,400
so we meant we minimize complexity but

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,220
it's not particularly transparent and

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,200
it's very hard to repeat patterns and

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,760
it's actually even hard to notice the

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,530
patterns that you should be repeating

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,660
when they already exist in fact the

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,130
complexity goes up a lot if you have

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,520
tricky layouts if you have a lot of

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,320
theme regions if you have for example 43

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,200
of them which I saw on a project two

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,810
years ago 43 how do you even work with

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,490
that so even though this gets a thumbs

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,220
up it's important to note this is a

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:42,860
Garfield thumbs up so it's it's a little

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:46,310
bit me all right now we're on to some of

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,140
the non-core stuff context module hands

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,250
up who here knows what context module

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,360
does good I'm impressed

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,650
what are you guys doing at a session

00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:03,590
about this all right call out some words

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:05,770
for me what is context module do I can

00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,770
wait

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:14,000
flexible you just knew that I wanted to

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,710
hear that all right context lets you

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,140
apply different behaviors on your

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,680
website depending on contextual

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,930
information I had a site that had four

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,340
different URLs and applied different

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,350
color schemes and block layouts

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,720
depending on what URL you were using to

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,980
access the site it sounds ridiculous but

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,040
it was actually a perfectly legitimate

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,730
use case but that's the power of context

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,279
so now I have to switch into

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:48,949
screen mirroring mode here which will

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:53,899
take me just a moment and mirror

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:56,649
displays dun dun dun you guys can see

00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,699
behind the curtain now alright

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,220
know where this for when I'm looking at

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:03,699
my own screen so I have a demonstration

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,260
site set up here on my local machine

00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,910
it's called oh my

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,309
I've populated it with development

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,860
content everything else is out of the

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,380
box Drupal except I enable a couple of

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,390
convenience modules like admin menu and

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,939
module filter things like that that

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,790
don't affect layout I also enabled

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:27,049
context so we're gonna play a little bit

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,669
with this let's go up here alright so

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,990
first we're gonna set up and you guys

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,000
can see that note can't you right I

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,570
should have printed that out first we're

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,240
going to set up a front page context so

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,490
that we get a sense of how this works so

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:45,260
here's the context admin back-end and

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,650
we're going to add a new context unique

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,870
ID

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,679
we'll call this front page because I

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:54,620
like being semantic and I'm gonna give

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:59,470
it a tag front page this page is the

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:04,400
front it is not the back but the front

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:07,910
page now this is where the meat comes in

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,080
we get to set conditions and reactions

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,910
that should happen when all those

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,919
conditions are true or when some of

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,590
those conditions are true depending so

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:19,760
for this really simple context we are

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,950
going to say the path should be front

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,690
and you can see down here we have

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,190
instructions that explain how you should

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,330
write paths but it's the same thing that

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,299
you've seen elsewhere in the Drupal

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,440
interface so as long as the path is

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:35,870
front the reactions and we could do a

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,830
variety of things including settings CSS

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:43,179
body classes there's just tons we're

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,179
going to set blocks

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:50,409
oh yeah you guys are missing the best

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:56,259
looking part of my browser that left

00:18:50,409 --> 00:19:01,330
part oh yeah

00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:03,249
oh yeah that's satisfying yeah I know

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,830
the slides are hard cuz it's full screen

00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:07,869
and magic unless you have a clever trick

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,820
for it no all right that's just the way

00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:15,009
it's gonna be good thank you all right

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,769
so we're gonna set some blocks and I'm

00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:21,999
just gonna set some blocks for fun let's

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:25,389
say I want to see powered by a drupal at

00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:28,889
the top and I like system help we'll put

00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:31,659
those up in let's put them in the header

00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:35,440
just click add and by magic they appear

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:38,950
there and who's new and who's online

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,479
let's put that into the sidebar nice and

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,589
simple any questions about what is

00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:46,419
happening so far good I would be worried

00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:49,330
about you if there were this is quite

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:52,440
simple we're gonna hit save and let's

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,440
have a look at that front page

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,139
all right there's powered by Drupal in

00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,769
the header

00:19:56,139 --> 00:20:00,759
there's our who's new and who's online

00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:03,249
everything is working perfectly

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,379
according to plan can anybody tell me

00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:09,519
what is not going according to my

00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:12,899
context here has anybody noticed the

00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:16,359
blocks that I did not put in context

00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:17,919
search navigation with where did this

00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,529
come from I didn't put that in context

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,269
this is because context complements the

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:27,159
core block system those are the blocks

00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:29,529
that are there by default in core system

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,929
help up in the top main page contents

00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,789
which we can't get rid of search form

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,379
navigation so let's just disable those

00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,379
make this a little bit clearer

00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:46,210
interestingly you cannot you have to you

00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:48,909
cannot hide main page content in the

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,269
blocks interface it won't let you so you

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:54,639
cannot use context for a complete total

00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:58,739
page layout core blocks has to handle

00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:58,739
where the main page content is coming

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:06,720
great that makes a lot more sense

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,720
and if we go to some arbitrary node

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,450
suddenly we don't have those elements

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,060
that we put in context makes sense

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,200
nice and clear right so let's have a

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,770
look at some of the things that are a

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,690
little bit trickier with context we're

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,420
gonna add another context here that's

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,980
just gonna notice if I made min actually

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,470
we'll do one first that notices if I'm

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,620
anonymous and one if that notices if I'm

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:40,980
if I'm admin no LastPass I don't want

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:45,100
anything that great conditions user role

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,870
anonymous reactions blocks let's put our

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:53,940
login block somewhere incredibly

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,940
prominent like featured single click

00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:05,560
sure that's all we need and if we open

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:07,210
up a private browsing window we'll see

00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,540
all great it notice that I'm anonymous

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,420
there's my user login and enormous

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,460
characters actually it's not a bad idea

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:19,180
if you really want to make people

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,740
register register now we also have the

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,920
other blocks that are on this that we

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,110
positioned on this page fine and clear

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,890
let's add our next context which is for

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,890
admin user

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,400
same thing use a role administrator

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,010
blocks this time will do some of the

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:51,230
more interesting ones like let's put

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:51,230
back up my great let's put arbitrary PHP

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,740
yeah let's just find it and we'll put

00:22:53,670 --> 00:23:03,320
that in the sidebar and then let's also

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,320
do the context inspector here in content

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:13,740
so once again hard refresh please you'll

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,809
see because I'm anonymous in this

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,320
browser window I don't have those new

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:22,380
blocks because I am because I'm an

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,690
administrator I have my cool new blocks

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:30,059
so here's the first thing that's a

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:33,780
little bit tricky why is who's new above

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,280
the backup my great stuff like the order

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,220
of these is kind of weird whose new

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,450
backup my great who's online then PHP

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,250
code then switch user can anybody with a

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,929
show of hands does anybody know what's

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:55,110
going on here just call it out what do

00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:57,240
you think is happening the weight of the

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,740
blocks is set to zero which is exactly

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,540
the problem but it's a bit tricky to

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,580
describe it that way actually what's

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,770
going on is that there are two contexts

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,299
that are actually evaluating to true

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,549
here that are trying to control what's

00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,610
going on with blocks and what happens is

00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,890
they all just put them into the region

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,059
and then core blocks tries to sort out

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,570
all right well what blocks should go in

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,520
what order

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,460
and unless you're careful about it it

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,260
comes out more or less random so we'll

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,130
go back to our context interface here

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:29,400
and let's look at our front page there's

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,990
the blocks magic button that is usually

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,210
only used if you have JavaScript

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:37,080
problems but it's very useful in context

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,720
show block weights these are the weights

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,460
that are respected even across contexts

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,380
so actually I'll open up the other one

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,790
in a separate tab and we can have a look

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,790
at menus err

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,960
blocks sidebar first

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:55,409
oh yeah we're already there so you can

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,539
see negative 10 negative 10 so that

00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:59,580
happens alphabetically who's online is

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:02,039
negative 9 so that goes alphabetically

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,500
beside to execute PHP and then negative

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,000
8 so if we really want to make sure that

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,399
things go in the right place you really

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:18,350
need to manually set these so I'll make

00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:20,880
sure that the administrator pool

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:24,750
marvelous Oh would you like sorry is

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,730
that yes or no yes good this is the same

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,409
concept that we use again and again so

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,639
we'll just hit save and now we can see

00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:34,139
where it is great and now all of the

00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:36,360
admin's to fizz at the bottom right

00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,679
where we put it wonderful the other

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,289
thing that's a little bit tricky with

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,970
context is especially once you have a

00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,919
complete site figuring out where the

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,110
heck did these blocks come from it is

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,059
not unusual to arrive at a page and go

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,149
well who's new like where the hell did

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,309
that come from the context inspector is

00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,799
a fantastic tool for it it's why I

00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,870
enabled it for admin so this is actually

00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:00,330
a crew mo output of the array that

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,039
context is using to decide what's going

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,090
to be displayed on the page and you can

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,789
click through to see all right well

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,279
there are two contexts that are

00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:10,860
evaluating here front page this is the

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,889
basic information here the conditions

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:19,559
that have to be true here's the

00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:20,760
reactions and again this is actually

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,730
coming right out of the array that

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,980
context uses itself this is from the

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,600
horse's mouth so there are no layers of

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,639
interpretation or assumption that are

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,320
involved here it's quite a good tool for

00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:34,260
figuring out what the heck is going on

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,679
with your contexts let's see what I'm

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:41,940
missing overlap content inspector

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,210
relative block weight sucks yeah we got

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,909
it

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,090
so the one really useful use case that

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:50,250
I'm going to show you is one that I that

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,570
I like to do on some sites when I'm

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,429
gonna have clients acting as

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,549
administrators I like to make it really

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,720
visible for them really visible for them

00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,179
the fact that they're logged in as

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,879
administrators I'm going to use the same

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:06,600
at min user context we set up and I'm

00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:14,519
just gonna say I'm going to add another

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:17,249
body class admin user great now as long

00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,899
as you're logged in as admin let's have

00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:22,440
a look at inspect element here as long

00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:25,110
as you're logged in as admin body gets

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,289
this extra class admin user and it's

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,330
very easy to make a it's very easy to

00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,629
make a little theming change to make for

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,100
example all of the text read I

00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:36,480
definitely do that punishes the user

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,879
they shouldn't be logged in as admin

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:44,460
anyway keeps them paying my bills this

00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:46,169
is a really useful tool does anybody

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,999
have any questions about context before

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,940
we go to sum up context and move on to

00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:52,499
the next yes in the back you're gonna

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,940
have to run to a microphone though or

00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:55,940
all or just yell and I'll repeat it

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,890
what if you have two contexts with well

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,160
confliction you block block views for

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,410
example admins show search homepage does

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,240
your choice

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,060
what happens if you're an eponym now

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,400
based in that's a very good question

00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:23,160
context works by a white list of what to

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,650
show at least the blocks to do so you

00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,350
can't explicitly say don't show this

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,140
block so it's a purely additive module

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,300
so model so if you have two contexts and

00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,580
one doesn't say anything about search

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,130
and the other one says show this search

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:46,080
will appear good question

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:48,150
any other questions yes so it seems

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,930
context is a better UI for the block

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:54,240
system I wholeheartedly agree to a point

00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,860
and actually this is gonna be a great

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,660
opportunity for me to get out of

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:07,410
mirroring mode hope that you guys get

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:12,140
the right one I seem to have lost that

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:14,580
one entirely let's try this again

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,640
interesting did you guys see into the

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:21,780
presentation oh yeah there it is a whole

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,970
whole demonstration time excellent right

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,440
so that's the magic of context that's me

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:30,600
your nerdy magician and you can be two

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,150
context pros and cons so in the pros

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,470
column context extends core blocks and

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,870
templates which means it's a pretty

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,150
minimal add-on as far as weight you

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,100
still get the next nice contextual menus

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,200
to edit blocks you can still get the

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,240
benefits of core block compatibility

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,120
with everything else in the world this

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,000
is a big winner for simplicity you can

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,830
reuse blocks and regions which is a part

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,020
of what makes this way better than core

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,210
blocks you can get around that pesky

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,220
problem of a thousand regions or

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,800
duplicate blocks you can actually get

00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,700
the most out of those sixteen basic

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,160
regions context is extremely flexible

00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,230
it's easy to add a new context for a

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,450
very specific use case and completely

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,490
change the layout or styling there are

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,650
plugins for context that allow you to

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,930
say change the theme

00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,370
entirely right the same way that we

00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,370
change to an admin theme when were

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,810
anything that begins with slash admin

00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,790
you can change your theme entirely based

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,120
on something much more subtle is it

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,500
Tuesday we'll have the Tuesday theme I

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,070
actually did this once for Talk Like a

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:40,950
Pirate Day I had a pirate theme I also

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:43,850
had too much time on my hands let's try

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,320
not to spill around the electronics

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,290
let's see you need a new layout just one

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,940
click away contexts RC Tools X portables

00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,190
which means they are totally supported

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,710
by features this means that your

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,300
contexts are easily too easily exported

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:01,020
and controlled in code which is a

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,410
massive win and with the context

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,080
inspector you can debug contexts pretty

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,610
easily you can see which contexts are

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,010
active at any point in time and

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:15,990
generally figure out what's going on and

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:18,330
why in the Khans column this is where we

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,860
start to get the limitations context

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,590
doesn't actually do anything to help you

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,060
exporting your blocks if you have any

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,010
blocks defined through the core block

00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,080
system you're gonna have a hard time

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,880
getting them into coda just like we did

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,580
in the last in the first example here

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,090
context is very flexible but it's also

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,650
completely unstructured this is a hard

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,750
one to demo so I have to do this

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,180
conceptually how are you gonna

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,130
categorize your contexts you're gonna

00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,740
end up with 20 or 30 of them if you do

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:54,270
context only for your site so what are

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,950
those tags path based use they're based

00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,770
so like on the conditions or is it on

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:02,280
behaviors like block contexts or style

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:06,210
contexts or semantically by what region

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:08,040
of the site this applies to it doesn't

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,040
matter if you have three contexts you're

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,650
completely fine but if you have 15 or 20

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,290
or 50 this suddenly becomes really

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:18,240
important especially when the project is

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,070
90% done in the client says I want this

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,840
really cool new layout and you have to

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,880
figure out where are all those site-wide

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,340
contacts where all the things that are

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,410
adding these blocks and almost every

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,920
time you end up having to rewrite all of

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,020
the other contexts that are

00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,580
vault just to make this one new page

00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:38,950
work you can survive this if you are

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:43,210
really mean to your clients but I

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,580
haven't found a better way one set of

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,060
regions still has to handle all of your

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:52,600
layouts in our example so what if I had

00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,700
a layout that only has two regions and

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,940
two regions that are quite different

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:01,630
from the 16 that I've got already what

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,400
if I have one that needs 17 regions what

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,160
if I have a layout that still needs 16

00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,110
regions but in a different position than

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,640
what we had here so those region names

00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,310
don't mean anything anymore

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,250
what if sidebar left is now positioned

00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:17,590
in the header all of a sudden this gets

00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:23,140
actually really hard to manage you get

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:25,150
into some very unsymmetric situations if

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,440
you really have several layouts and

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,000
several set of conditions that

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,940
significantly change the site the

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,340
context UI gets awful very very quickly

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,960
this is a huge minus on the transparency

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,050
front and this is a limitation that I

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,030
think it shares with the block module so

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,730
in our rating system context does a

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:46,030
little bit better than core blocks I've

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,000
never seen a purely context layout site

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:52,360
that wasn't really hard to wrap my head

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,770
around and that's just the way it is if

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,050
you know how to use the context

00:33:53,770 --> 00:34:00,280
inspector it can be quite transparent on

00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:02,500
a page per page basis and a well-done

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,750
set of structures is built around simple

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,260
structures that repeat and get destroyed

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:13,660
by the client before you get to launch

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:15,490
every time every time so other things

00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,230
that you may want to look into if you

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:21,160
weren't terribly familiar with context

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:24,220
before spaces which allows you to do a

00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,679
lot more behaviors based on context and

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,390
actually have totally what feels like

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,610
totally different sites and a lot of

00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,530
different site-wide variables different

00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,470
site name depending on context

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:40,810
conditions actually very very powerful

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:42,640
for multi-site Perl which I hate because

00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,300
it sounds like the programming language

00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,090
but it's not

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,220
this is context / URL this is what I use

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:52,240
to get four different URLs that produce

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:54,370
different behaviors and of course the

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,530
ability to roll your own custom context

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,320
conditions and reactions there is one

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,690
piece of black magic and that is see

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,040
tools plugins they are confusing to

00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,110
learn about the first time but they

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,200
allow you to do things like custom

00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,180
context conditions that is an absolute

00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,730
must-have if you're going to use context

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,390
on a any really large-scale Drupal site

00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:18,220
there is a good block there is a fine

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:21,010
beautifully written blog post about it

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:24,760
at oh the huge Manatee org that you guys

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:30,220
can have a look at all right yes

00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,990
question no I actually haven't had to

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,830
use Delta but would you like to give us

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,830
a quick explanation

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,869
so I'm just gonna repeat for the our

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,450
Youtube million our YouTube Millions

00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:10,420
no problem so Delta is the module that

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,890
lets you change themes based on context

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,869
and you can have completely separate

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,160
themes you could have one that's Zen one

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,170
that's Omega and one that's completely

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,240
built from scratch by your nephew or

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,180
they can be different variants on the

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,009
same theme multiple variants of Omega or

00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,890
I think you can do even the same theme

00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:28,690
with different settings right right

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,890
actually very useful you're completely

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:35,890
right I should put that on the list for

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:39,700
next time yeah context conditions are

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,170
what makes Delta switch alright any

00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,089
other questions or comments about

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,900
context other cool modules that are

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:48,670
worth mentioning alright I'm sure we

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,210
missed some but it's okay YouTube

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:54,279
comments will trash us for it now it's

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,559
time to look at another big popular si

00:36:54,279 --> 00:37:01,720
tools based methodology panels

00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:09,039
who here's used panels why are you guys

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:11,140
here this slide is a little confusing li

00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,450
titled I know I said panels panels

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,569
everywhere it was a meme reference the

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:20,349
trouble is that there is also panels

00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:24,099
everywhere which is a methodology that

00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:27,460
means no core blocks no template files

00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:31,420
no theming no theming for the layout at

00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,999
all no code just panels for everything

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,430
in your entire site it's a pretty cool

00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:39,309
methodology it should tell you something

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:42,099
about just how powerful panels is that

00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:44,890
you can actually replace half the theme

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,390
layer with it but it's not really what

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,950
I'm gonna talk about we will mention it

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:52,710
a little bit more but let's take a

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,710
closer look demo time again

00:37:53,870 --> 00:38:05,060
mere wire awesome all right do we want

00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:08,410
to disable context entirely sure let's

00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,410
disable context entirely

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:26,099
it's gone beautiful layout is gone and

00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:27,420
we're going to enable you know what I'll

00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:35,579
do this in the UI cuz it's way more

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:39,059
legible panels lots of modules come with

00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:46,529
panels I'm gonna skip panel notes extra

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:52,470
layouts panels there's a views one too

00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:55,759
that needs to be here content panes yeah

00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:00,210
okay that's great because it was off odd

00:38:55,759 --> 00:39:02,339
all right so the basic concept behind

00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,380
panels is to give you a drag-and-drop

00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,239
interface for dragging blocks around

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,700
layouts that the solution to this

00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:11,369
infinitely long list of 300 different

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,650
blocks that can go anywhere and having

00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:15,690
to drag them around is to is to instead

00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:18,359
have an interface that looks like the

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,549
layout of your page a little bit

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,289
revolutionary I know and you should be

00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:31,289
able to drag a block from one region to

00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:33,150
another it's amazing that's the core

00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:35,130
concept behind it so we're gonna walk

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,470
through first of all a simple case that

00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:40,349
is really common we're gonna use panels

00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:43,049
to know we have to activate page mono

00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:48,289
man page manager but then we're going to

00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:48,289
use panels to create a front page

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:05,130
oops panels misclicked alright so we're

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,230
gonna use we're gonna use one of their

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,090
little wizards and you're gonna very

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:12,360
quickly discover the big Bugaboo is

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:17,010
about panels so we're gonna create a new

00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:20,400
page front the page which is the front

00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:26,610
and which is not the back but the front

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:29,610
and we'll give it a URL and make it our

00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:31,140
site home page so the first thing that's

00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,240
confusing is this is actually this

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,920
interface is not provided by panels this

00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,620
is provided by the page manager module

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,090
which comes with C tools which means

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,580
that it has no idea what you're creating

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:45,050
this page to do what page manager does

00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:48,390
is it lets you create a new URL and do

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:50,340
something with it out of the box what it

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,560
lets you do is just give an HTTP

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,770
response code you could have it have a

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,080
URL path that always gives a 302

00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:00,840
redirect for example it's a pretty edge

00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,480
use case but panels hijacks this to say

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:09,690
oh no no we want to have a panel happen

00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:15,770
here oh yeah that path is already in use

00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:15,770
let's change this front

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:24,900
may as well be cute right all right so a

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,510
panels makes it relatively easy to

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,589
define your own custom layouts in your

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:33,510
theme which means that you there's a lot

00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,460
to choose from I really like working

00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:37,260
with a module called panels extra

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,119
layouts which I highly recommend because

00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,329
it comes with some incredibly flexible

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,170
theme layouts like this one that you see

00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:46,170
before you

00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,030
this is nuts the number of block regions

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,309
that you've got but you never have to

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,240
see them in just a plain list so it's ok

00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,500
we can just drag things around it's also

00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,109
adaptive which is pretty cool it means

00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,119
that blocks expand to the rights to

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:02,010
their nearest neighbor so we have three

00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,780
block regions in the top key and three

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,280
block regions in the top here if you

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,200
have something on the far left and

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,130
nothing to the right it will take full

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,559
width let's take something a bit simpler

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,660
that I think comes out of panels itself

00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,650
I thought to be honest I'm not sure

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,299
let's take how many columns do we feel

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,710
like today let's let's do two columns

00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:30,210
there's now we'll do something different

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:33,690
63 63 37 stacked this is gonna be the

00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,880
front II page we have the option to try

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,920
and disable all of the Drupal blocks and

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,839
regions this works on some themes not on

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,460
others I'm going to ignore it for today

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,490
it is something that you basically have

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,230
to play with to see if it works and I'm

00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:51,900
going to include the in-place editor

00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:53,549
because it's cool and I'm just going to

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,680
hit finish it looks like I should do

00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:58,140
something here but trust me I want to

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:06,010
get out of the pages interface and into

00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:08,950
panels alright

00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,270
this is the panels interface finally we

00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,590
had to get through a bunch of wizard

00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,330
steps that looked like they were being

00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,100
friendly and giving us options we cared

00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,940
about but actually give us options that

00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,680
we don't care about so we're going to

00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,480
ignore everything on the left for now

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,880
most of that was set accurately if it

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,400
was set fine for us in that in the in

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,550
the wizard so we're just going to say no

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,590
title and some things I happen to know

00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,420
are provided in hard code by Bartok

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,890
because it's naughty we're gonna put

00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:41,890
things in the left side add content

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:44,410
views let's put the front page view

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,540
that's a nice one to have and we'll pick

00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,160
which display we want we could put the

00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,470
feet on the front page if we really want

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,030
it - oh and there are all these nice

00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,190
settings for how this view should

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,950
display including giving it special

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,200
arguments or overriding the overriding

00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,570
the URL or using different pager

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,770
settings things that are all quite handy

00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:06,520
if you're gonna be moving things around

00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:10,420
and here's the magic do we want that in

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:16,090
the header left or right can I get

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:22,090
applause left that was tepid right

00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:24,730
sidebar make it ugly header all right

00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,350
this is a right sidebar it is and I can

00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,860
do that sort of thing because I have a

00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,390
grown-up drag-and-drop interface and

00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:35,830
we're going to add something in the Left

00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:38,530
sidebar so that it looks nice powered by

00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:42,370
Drupal sure let's put something else in

00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:44,770
there though you get to check you get a

00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:48,190
some kind of a sense of what sort of

00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:51,880
options that we have here it's not menu

00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,770
yeah okay new forum topics let that

00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,820
happen

00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,930
update and shave let's have a look at

00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,470
our front page and see if I forgot

00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:03,340
anything

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:05,110
no there we go so two columns powered by

00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,510
Drupal in the main column and new forum

00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,970
topics because I hate those UX people

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,650
anyway and here on the right is our main

00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,820
page content because who really needs

00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:18,910
usability readability is there are there

00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:22,190
any questions about how that just worked

00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,230
excellent so that's this simple use case

00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,869
and that's something that's playing to

00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,760
panel strengths let's do something

00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,710
that's a little bit trickier now we're

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,320
gonna do nodes we're gonna actually

00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:37,130
change the way node layouts work if you

00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:44,480
recall our nodes have no layout right

00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:47,060
now so let's go back to panels and we're

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,440
going to enable the node template you

00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,750
should notice here on the right side so

00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,150
these are ways to override things that

00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:55,369
are have built in templates in Drupal so

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,410
if you want to customize the way the the

00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:59,210
node add edit form is this is probably

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,339
the easiest way to do it you can drag

00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,869
and drop the form elements if you want

00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,460
to customize the way your users look

00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:07,820
this is not a bad way to do it either

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:11,780
but we just want to say node template so

00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:13,880
we will enable that guy and edit and

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,250
once again we're in this really weird

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,770
interface and nobody knows what to do

00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:21,619
with it so the reason this is totally

00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:24,650
different is because when you when you

00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:27,680
are overriding a template the panels has

00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,450
a system of their variants kind of like

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,210
how there's a view and then there's like

00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,220
30 displays of that view and they're all

00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,190
kind of the same thing but all kind of

00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,470
not panels variants is a similar kind of

00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:42,170
model except that it will go through

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:44,960
checking each one in order to see which

00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,579
layout should be applied here so right

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,460
now we have no variants so it's just

00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:51,460
gonna fall back to Drupal we're gonna

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:56,210
add a new variant and we'll do this for

00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:59,810
forum posts and then everything else

00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:03,410
we're gonna do is exactly the same let's

00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:07,069
get another layout this time two columns

00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,819
I like this even to column because it's

00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:12,010
kind of useless

00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:12,010
I'll do the in-place editor again

00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:20,540
continue and create variant update and

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,700
save same steps that I did before

00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,950
ignoring most of the wizard because it's

00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,650
just hard to know what's going to end up

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:29,450
where so in our where this is going to

00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,220
be just the same as what we did a moment

00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,920
ago we're going

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,750
to say what do we want so now we have

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,560
some options here that come from the

00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:41,210
node we can take absolutely any field in

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,940
that individual field so let's put some

00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:49,460
things in the left sidebar let's put the

00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:53,060
image in left sidebar and I don't want a

00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:56,390
label and image is a great formatter and

00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,170
I don't know that's a nice that's a nice

00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,520
image style

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:12,140
that's pretty add content node body this

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:14,420
time now we also can set the title of

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,520
the page this gets set the HTML header

00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,670
element as well as the h1 element at the

00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,849
top and we're going to use a system that

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,530
looks a lot like what we get it looks a

00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:26,119
lot like what you get tokens elsewhere

00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,650
in Drupal and honestly it works very

00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,170
similarly on the inside but more

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,060
reliable you can look through this list

00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:36,800
of substitutions we're just gonna take

00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:39,619
note % node title and update and save

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,180
and let's go look at a page has been

00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:47,680
updated and saved and let's go find

00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:47,680
ourselves a forum post a forum topic

00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:56,289
oh there's no image on this one

00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:59,559
dun-dun-dun maybe there's an image on

00:48:56,289 --> 00:49:01,240
this guy either that or my image

00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:04,410
formatter is not working but we can see

00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,410
that we're in the right layouts

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:18,970
yeah that oh you know what that's a

00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:19,780
really good point I know good call good

00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,930
call

00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,539
great so one thing that you should note

00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:28,089
now if you haven't already is that the

00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:31,420
UI for forms is a confusing mess for

00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:33,359
four panels is a confusing mess the

00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,160
basic drag-and-drop functionality

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:39,190
awesome but you run into problems like

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,640
this all the time where why isn't that

00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:44,109
field showing up while I'm at it I can

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,650
show you some of the extended things

00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:49,960
that that panels can do like we can set

00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:53,890
CSS properties we can say oh this should

00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:56,950
have a special CSS ID or class we can

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,450
set a totally different special style

00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,640
system that has nothing to do with

00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,349
anything else anywhere in Drupal rounded

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,380
corners how the heck does that work

00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:07,750
nobody knows but it happens we can set

00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,430
special visibility rules to say things

00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,650
kind of like what we just did with you

00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,839
with context this should only be

00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:19,839
displayed if the user has the permission

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,140
edit terms in forums for example I'm not

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,230
going to do that because that's terrible

00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:28,089
we have special caching rules that you

00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,069
can apply actually panels has a built-in

00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:32,740
caching system that is relatively easy

00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:35,109
to write custom cache plug-ins for but

00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:38,319
even their basic simple cache is pretty

00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:39,819
cool set a lifetime and set granularity

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,670
so for example if your page has

00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:45,279
arguments like a node ID for example

00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:47,680
this will keep a separate page cache for

00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:49,839
each node and with a lifetime of 15

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,359
seconds that will work for authenticated

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,260
users as well you just got yourself a

00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:57,520
really fast site for authenticated users

00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,619
for context if you have any special

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,329
context conditions that we'll look at in

00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:03,190
a second in panels the panels is aware

00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:10,000
of this will separate it out

00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:13,420
contacts conditions yes and you're doing

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,160
these caching per field now because if

00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,130
you do want it for a whole page you have

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,910
in the top I learn it just a few months

00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:24,640
ago yeah so this is caching specifically

00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:27,370
propane per individual component of a

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,100
page this is actually for authenticated

00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:32,170
users really useful it's very common

00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,790
that you have one block that has custom

00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:36,040
information for the user and everything

00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:39,460
else can be cached and this saves you a

00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,020
lot of a lot of load the big downside

00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,180
with all of those options I just showed

00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:46,120
you is that you're never going to figure

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,890
out that you set them again you're going

00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,920
to look at this and go why the hell do I

00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,660
have rounded corners where did that CSS

00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,890
class come from and you're gonna just

00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,870
get you're gonna drive yourself to

00:51:53,890 --> 00:52:00,130
cutting over I had a theme or almost

00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:03,780
kill me go for it or just yell a few

00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,780
I'll repeat it it's fine

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,339
yes it is included in the in cash clear

00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,079
all one of the great things about Drupal

00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:19,460
7 is that it's easy for people to

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,069
declare they're all four modules to

00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,470
declare their own cash bins panels does

00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:26,540
as well I'm pretty sure that in the

00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,180
admin menu no I know in the admin menu

00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:32,450
it's included in page and else which is

00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:34,579
everything else but if you hit flush all

00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,920
caches here or if you run cash player

00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:41,210
all like happens on cron it's going to

00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,790
include panels caches good questions so

00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,859
the downside is we have this complexity

00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,150
that gets really hidden it's incredibly

00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:49,309
powerful but you're never gonna find

00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,890
those options but one of the big upsides

00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:55,099
that I really wanted to show you is this

00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:57,020
cascading behavior so we have forum

00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:58,369
posts right now and we know that apart

00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,900
from the fact that forum posts don't

00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:02,809
even have an image field that works

00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:06,980
great we're gonna create another variant

00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:12,980
I have no idea what time I'm supposed to

00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:21,970
stop can somebody tell me two minutes

00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:24,440
ago you're stuck we started late so

00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,059
actually this is an important concept so

00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,549
I'm going to finish this one and we will

00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:31,760
jump to summaries and the elixir of life

00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:33,829
and you guys can leave if you need to if

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:37,040
you need to I won't feel insulted for

00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:39,440
long so we're gonna add a new variant

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,940
this is going to be the default variant

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,480
this is gonna be the thing that it falls

00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:47,150
back to again exactly the same wizard

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:53,349
steps that we did before final use

00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:59,750
whatever the adaptive layout is continue

00:53:53,349 --> 00:54:07,880
title type default variant foo and let's

00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:09,049
add SEO I'm totally hurt and here I'm

00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,089
just going to add a couple of things

00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:14,290
quickly that I'm sure are involved you

00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:17,569
know some of the other ones like image

00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:22,359
finish and maybe will drop something on

00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:22,359
the right-hand side like title

00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:32,839
no title sure create variant so what's

00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:34,579
going to happen here and I'm going to

00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:38,149
tell you before I show you because it's

00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:40,249
faster it's been saved is that when when

00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:43,459
Drupal hits a node it's gonna go through

00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:46,039
these variants in in descending order so

00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:48,499
it's gonna first check and see oh does

00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:50,509
the forum post variant apply here and it

00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:52,489
will if it seems like forum post is

00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:54,199
right and if it doesn't apply it's gonna

00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,719
go to the default variant and the rules

00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:58,849
that it uses to tell if it should apply

00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,459
are under selection rules here

00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:06,769
oddly enough so we're going to say that

00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:14,899
forum posts only applies if the node

00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:20,179
type is forum topic again quite a lot

00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:22,399
like context great that's saved so

00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:28,389
forums are gonna get this same layout

00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:28,389
and I let's find on that's not a forum

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,210
and we get a default variant on every

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,310
other kind of nodes what this gives you

00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,860
is a really easy way to build repeatable

00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:46,200
structure that's visible at a glance you

00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,000
have one panels interface that shows you

00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,040
the content types that have special

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,080
layouts and falls back to a content type

00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,320
that to the default that handles

00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,640
everything else all right I'm gonna jump

00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,780
back this and I'm just gonna jump

00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:12,900
through the summaries because that's

00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:15,630
what we got time for and it's a pity

00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,000
I've got superheroes panels is the

00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,830
Magneto

00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,780
because if it's made of metal panels can

00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,450
handle it and do everything with it so

00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,890
panels very broad power very high

00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,740
granularity you can get down to the

00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:31,140
field level and individual CSS selectors

00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,870
it has great failover structures for

00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,300
repeatability the in-place editor

00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,400
actually is nice for novice users you

00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,260
can hit a button on the actual page and

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,190
drag elements around it looks kind of

00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:46,170
Drupal 80 if a bit more clunky and it's

00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:52,340
context-sensitive just like the context

00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:55,200
module was cons sole wrenchingly bad UI

00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,810
heavy codebase this does have a big

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,910
memory impact on your site see tools

00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:02,160
plugins are weird when you have to write

00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:03,840
something custom for panels it's very

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,970
similar to writing something custom for

00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,590
context but it's weird and hard to wrap

00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:09,810
your head around the first time also

00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:13,680
very good blog posts on all the huge

00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:15,240
Manatee org about it it's overkill if

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,630
you have simple layouts if you have two

00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,190
layouts on your website don't use panels

00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:22,770
and it's honestly difficult for

00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:24,750
individual fields if you just want one

00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:26,910
column and you want to layout title

00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:31,380
above body and in the comments below it

00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:33,060
don't use panels so we can see that

00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,740
panels has its own downside and

00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,680
complexity but it's sweet in

00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:41,190
repeatability it's sweet in transparency

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,840
in its own way there isn't time for

00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:45,060
anything else but these are the ones

00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,650
that I really wanted to get to and we're

00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,180
gonna jump through display suite I'm

00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:52,170
just gonna go right to the

00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:56,520
pros and cons gene Wilder

00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:58,980
I'm sorry gene display sweet works just

00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,020
like the Drupal field display user

00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,750
interface from the field API so it's

00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,640
really easy to use it has very high

00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:08,040
granularity you can even clean up your

00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:12,390
Dom with it and specify simplified

00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,609
classes and and and HTML you can use the

00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:17,250
exact same layouts that panels supports

00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:19,170
so the same list of crazy adaptive

00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:22,650
layouts that I showed you apply in the

00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:24,839
display suite as well it's incredibly

00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:28,170
flexible and it has great features

00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:30,630
support cons are it only handles

00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:33,059
individual entity layouts so that means

00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:36,210
individual nodes individual users it

00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,829
doesn't do well it doesn't do well if

00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:40,109
you have a page that is an assembly of

00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:43,980
other content like a front page might be

00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:46,260
or a landing page for example there is

00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,609
no structure across different content

00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,099
types

00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:52,470
so this means that with display suite

00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:55,319
you work with teaser mode full build

00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:57,150
mode and you can define your own there

00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:59,520
is nothing that makes sure that that

00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:01,920
teaser mode looks the same on blog posts

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,400
as it does on articles as it does on

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,930
forums but looks different on events

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,420
this means you can get into situations

00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:11,520
like I did a couple weeks ago where I

00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:14,910
was doing an audit of six different

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,839
display suite display types across 24

00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:22,440
content types

00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:24,869
it sucks sucks there are still some

00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,150
hitches with features field order is not

00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:29,599
great still with display Street we're

00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:32,400
working on it

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,520
so display suite has its own downside

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,440
especially in repeatability there isn't

00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,780
time for fences which is a really nice

00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,430
way to have clean HTML there isn't time

00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,589
for field groups which makes it look

00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:45,720
pretty or object cache and entity cache

00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:47,309
which make it load fast or for how to

00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,660
roll your own display suite fields but I

00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:50,760
encourage you to go to oh the huge

00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:55,290
Manatee org and read all about it there

00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,240
and that's not really it because I just

00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:59,040
told you why everything sucks the

00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,140
reality is that's just another way to

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,680
say everything is kind of special and

01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,040
has it

01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,470
own benefit core Blox with context is

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,230
great for site-wide structures you only

01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:12,089
need a handful of contexts in order to

01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:15,089
do that and context is cool if you only

01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:17,550
have three or four contexts panels is

01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:19,230
great for non entity and multi entity

01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:22,050
layouts like your front page or big

01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:27,210
landing pages and display suite is the

01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:30,150
best thing for individual entities so my

01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:33,900
theory is the Megazord

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:36,480
theory and this is the Megazord theory

01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:39,089
in a nutshell I like to use context for

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,640
the relatively permanent page item page

01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:44,369
elements which in most cases means the

01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,290
header and the footer but in your K in

01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:47,970
your case it may mean a sidebar element

01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:50,309
or something that pops in in an overlay

01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,540
if you want to go to hell or if you have

01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:55,440
something that needs to slide in on the

01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:57,390
right side I like to use panels for the

01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,819
main content area this is the area where

01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:02,579
you have the most variability in what

01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:04,530
blocks you want to display in what

01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,940
layout you want to use sometimes it's a

01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,500
left sidebar sometimes it's a right

01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,390
sidebar sometimes it's something totally

01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,240
different and the great thing about

01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:14,819
panels is that it makes that part easy

01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,010
to manage and it builds structure for

01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:18,420
you you can see at a glance that the

01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:21,000
content types have different structures

01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,530
you can enforce consistency across them

01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,150
and you can see that there are three

01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:27,569
other URLs that have totally unique

01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:29,430
layouts finally whenever I'm displaying

01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:32,040
an individual node whether it's in

01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,390
whether it's one response in a view or

01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,480
whether it's buried in the middle of a

01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:38,250
main page I use display suite panels has

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,490
one of those fields that you can add for

01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:43,410
node is complete node and it just takes

01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:45,299
whatever Drupal is handing back to it

01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:47,130
which includes display suite includes

01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:49,410
cache display suite and it takes

01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,210
everything that you've got for and what

01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,579
this means is you have a nice cascading

01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,520
structure so your themer

01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:58,260
is happy because every page has a

01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,240
consistent structure no matter how weird

01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,220
the layout is the permanent fixture

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,869
elements are displayed in exactly the

01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,760
Dom they write into the template every

01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:07,980
single time thank you very much context

01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,540
the structures that change have all the

01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,609
flexibility that they need built into

01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:14,280
the HTML with the crazy multi-layered

01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:15,300
Dom that panels can provide so they can

01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,160
find a consistent

01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,560
to theme even the most variable parts of

01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,630
the site Thank You panels and the

01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,890
content all the content elements all

01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,470
have simple consistent

01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:29,370
HTML with custom classes Thank You

01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:32,790
display suite and optionally fences so

01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:35,190
megazord is my way of getting everything

01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:37,710
that I want the nice thing is you

01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,510
document it once and everybody knows

01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:42,810
that on any page if you don't know where

01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:44,340
an element is first check panels and see

01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:46,650
if it's listed there and then check

01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,840
display suite that's all you need to

01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,280
know you can see if you're running if

01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,310
you're using displace wait you can see

01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,230
if you're using a custom layout all

01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:57,450
right I know that I've got to let you

01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,370
guys go I'm gonna hang out up here for

01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:01,170
any questions please do come up and talk

01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:03,330
to me and I guess I'm gonna have to find

01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:06,170
a ball because we're out of time thank

01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:06,170
