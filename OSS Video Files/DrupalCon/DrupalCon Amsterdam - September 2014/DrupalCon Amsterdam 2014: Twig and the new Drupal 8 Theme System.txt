Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Twig and the new Drupal 8 Theme System
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: mortendkFabianxjoelpittet
Drupal 8 will have a fancy new template engine (Twig) and a simplified theme layer. We'll show you the new syntax (don't worry, it's easy) and walk through how you can actually use Twig in your every day lives.

Are you a theme developer? Come see how consistent, easy, and straightforward it will be to create your own custom themes.
Do you maintain contributed modules? Come learn what you need to do in order to adapt your code for Drupal 8.
In this session some of your friendly Drupal 8 theme system co-maintainers will walk through the state of Drupal 8's theme system. We'll talk about what's different from Drupal 7 but also walk through some of the internals of different aspects of the theme system and how they might affect your day-to-day work with Drupal.

Topics include:

A high-level overview of the changes to the theme system in Drupal 8.
Some of the goodies that are possible now that weâ€™re using Twig as our templating engine.
Using theme hook suggestions to cut down on custom code and have themers thanking you.
Phases of the theme system and where you can step in to alter things.

Thank You incoming for this small little

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,960
presentation of a little project we've

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,719
been working on since 2009 first of all

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,179
if anybody by accident-- get offended by

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279

as more than DK DK is normally a

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,269
language code though for denmark that's

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,470
not true my name is going for the div

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,630
killer this is a missing out on so have

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,520
one little charcoal hay galletas content

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,079
themes and stop this going good but

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
today here we have three clones of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,500
Joelle so that's also a part of the

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,059
front end group we have Joelle here we

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
have fabian came in raise your hands

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,899
people have been the brain behind a lot

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,550
of this stuff we have done all I've been

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,320
sitting in whining to him about what was

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,149
wrong and he didn't hold it and then we

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
have a part of our trig army if you can

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,090
raise your hand if you've done anything

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,609
in trick you're a part of the trick

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,500
Army's thank you for being here and so

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,379
that's all because first of all why do

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,450
we need to do things later to make the

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,220
fund in the shut the up and what do

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,560
i mean about that well here's the thing

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,689
this is Drupal 7 and how it works in a

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,270
simplified way this is how jul seven was

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,820
architected to fund n despite back-end

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,830
developers we know what you did whenever

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,799
you needed by the devil is donation his

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,799
home for years what it was the disco

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,950
ball for this kind of the wonderful

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,780
wonderful motto that you will gave us

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,420
out of the box because you all know that

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,710
we need one mock-up lab you guys just

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,560
come in and sit on the floor in the

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,390
middle you can do that I will not stop

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,400
away from that so this is kind of the

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,320
mark-up we got off Google 75 which can

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,649
give us a lot of possibilities to board

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,299
or theme was didn't like that so you

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,909
know it was a big what the is this

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,100
because apparently Drupal 7 database

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,240
crime is in the theme there's okay but

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,729
having the element and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,020
control over the CSS and markup is not

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,060
you could say that was a design flaw 27

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,409
also had this problem about noahide

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,880
learning curve specially when you come

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,979
in from the thin layer like hey I just

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,380
want to build a site I've know how to do

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,300
mark of an allowance to CSS boom welcome

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,250
to Drupal here's your pre process where

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,900
do you find that Thank You juvenile now

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,319
Inc my life for the next four years and

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:24,720
another issue we have it every are slow

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,670
this is true 17 in 2010 when 2014 now if

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,370
we begin to implement systems there was

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,810
serious talk about implementing 960 grid

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,700
system inside of rubles call back in

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,250
2009-2010 there's even a movement and I

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,150
know who were behind it clips DC the

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,010
North remembers that this of trying to

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,799
get this in we even have people who

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,470
wanted to have bootstrapping son the

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,600
North still remembers and the thing

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,670
about this trying to put these systems

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,030
inside a true colors that we adapt so

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,370
slow so when 960 was hot else back into

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,290
nine to 10 we're now into 14 when

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,150
bootstrap was really really hard it's a

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,130
couple of years ago and our release

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,840
cycle is not working that fast so no

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,640
matter what we put into tubercle it's

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,130
going to be outdated as soon as Google

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,709
call comes out and basically Google is

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,049
doing it wrong we're trying to change

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,720
with something but we're not and that's

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,250
a problem and so what we figured out but

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,930
we use a disgusting and disgusting a

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,319
disgusting was there was like two ways

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,810
of doing this it's a three phase yeah

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,569
two ways only two ways we actually did

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,549
and I did a survey about six months ago

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,260
and asked out for what people have a

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,329
issue of what was wrong in the Drupal

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,730
system what they wanted and so forth

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,019
before and what we ended up with was

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,900
three different answers there's the

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,519
people who want to you'll have sensible

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,200
defaults and that's like having a base

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,940
class names and stuff that comes out of

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,350
trouble that they can rely on and then

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,819
you have the the people who wanna

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,610
absolute freedom to do whatever they

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,770
want and then we had a third group

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,770
i think is people who just don't care

00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,420
and we don't care about them so but the

00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,860
common which was this we want ever theme

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,650
that is in control on a controller

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,330
markup on a controller of CSS if we get

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,930
to it and also get a new version of

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,570
jQuery that would be pretty ace so in

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,459
comes the banana what is the consensus

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,489
banana well you will now know how many

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,930
here knows what the consensus panel is

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:23,360
not enough you will all learn that now

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,820
okay so the consensus banana it has the

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,610
result of many many years of discussion

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,880
that ended up at rubicon in austin with

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,310
about 25 front-end developers disgusted

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,380
discussing yelling screaming crying and

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,300
with the banana in the head and pointing

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,310
at each other figure out what is that we

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,470
want we actually found consensus some

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,570
would say that finally morton me and

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,280
john open sitting right there finally

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,520
figured out a common way of building the

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,080
themes without gagging at each other so

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
here's the be eating idea we have Drupal

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,640
core dual core put something out it puts

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,280
out a bunch of variables that we would

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,350
call like that we can then create stuff

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,620
on so he creates we can create markup

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,760
and create CSS on it that is then we're

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,800
going to care that's going to be all

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,300
sensible defaults so you can build seven

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,770
on that you can build bartok on that

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,750
that's basically what google call

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,790
provides now but we put it in as a

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,950
middle layer here in the middle why

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,810
we're doing that well because then we

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,900
have Drupal 8 coming out the release

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,220
candidate 2014 we don't know yet when

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,500
that's going to come out they say it

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,229
comes out first next year that would not

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,990
be so good right it does this really

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,690
have to have the light of day um so

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,520
another way that some other people want

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,410
to see like will do whatever they want

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,390
to so they want to just grab the data

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,610
directly from core oh let's say you want

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,590
to build your stuff on at other base

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,290
theme or you will do the same but you

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,360
don't have to rely on the defaults that

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,950
Google provides any more google will

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,600
provide the tools for you to build the

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,400
defaults so you want to build a special

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,350
class you can do that if you want to

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,050
inherit what drew comes with and so we

00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,160
have a reliable stable base we're going

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,910
to have that so we are going to have

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,440
best of both worlds and that means that

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,010
we are actually going to have a new

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,370
theme in google

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:13,010
yes it is called classy classy will

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,410
provide sensible defaults and it do

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,960
though we tried this to each commit

00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,120
alert because duties has yet not took

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,919
taking his finger and present the big

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,590
button that will make this evening we're

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,040
all happy forever ever ever this is the

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,440
issue if somebody has a phone and wanna

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,830
treated him at trees and ask him when he

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,320
gets this fixed i would i would not

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,750
protest against that yeah well if you

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,990
seem impersonal just in and saying about

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,820
we want classy you need him do it and

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,400
there's actually reasons for this um

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,720
anyway so back again today's the idea

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,510
here is that you have to break your

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,370
clans and then you basically I know if

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,680
you build building on base teens

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,600
basically you have a sin kind of theme

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,560
for is just a mothership kind of theme

00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,060
so easily have something that's

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,460
completely stripped of everything or

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,100
have a bunch of sensible classes and

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,530
structure that you can rely on that's

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,100
the two different ways so how many inose

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,840
twix as a language thing okay let's just

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,610
go through it really quick cause I'm

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,740
gonna two demos of it this is a variable

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,350
this is a filter for variable this is

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,650
how to get data in so with drew will use

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,780
was that so fast okay start there here's

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,280
a parable this is how you print it down

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,830
you can then add a filter on it so you'd

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,870
like modify on it this is how we use to

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,970
print Google stuff out your google

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,090
where's my thing with that wound and see

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,349
the one looking for the data because we

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,150
don't want to give the theme is too much

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:39,650
control of the stuff i would need to

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,729
keep them wait little bit this is how

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,710
we're going to do it now we're going to

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,240
do that you can drill in with a dot

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,250
between so then so you can find that

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,650
thing that you want sensible defaults

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,020
and this is trent the new translation

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,970
text so if you want to translate a whole

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,610
particle this is how you then do that

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,880
with the chance tunz tunz tunz it's

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,099
funny in germany so you can comment

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,950
stuff out by adding a hashtag on each of

00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,900
these things instead you have pumps or

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,419
stuff that's what the percentage sign so

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,990
you have an evil and a lift you can do

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:14,000
you can set a new variable inside of the

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,810
trade templates or is it through print

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,930
out the template that will give you

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,790
yeah if boom and if same again we have

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,740
loops so it wont to have if you have a

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,650
an array of data you can do you that

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,120
really easy we have loop controls that

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,650
goes here I'm walking to show you

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,360
examples of this you're gonna suppose

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,690
this lines different no no I'm going to

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,430
hide them so only I know this stuff this

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,779
slides will come up and yes i'm also

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,190
going to show you an example of this all

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,020
this is coming up coming up because i

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,909
have so many demos of cold them on a

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,040
show so that's why it's like just giving

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:51,790
you a year this all right there more

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:53,980
time i did have to plan about doing this

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,540
live life but i also know pi when i

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,460
tested the lab three days ago and

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,370
destroyed my soul because we're still

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,070
nothing in a real person that that's not

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,020
even fine so I magic been doing a little

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,910
bit of video recording so let's go for

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,180
the first one this is deepak how do you

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,400
find stuff now Andrew blade well here's

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,529
what your way inside I go in and instead

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,270
of installing all kinds of things I am

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,150
just going to look at my sauce okay

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,070
where's this coming from I have no idea

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,680
right no idea at all where is this

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,470
coming from so what I'm doing I'm going

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,720
to go into my site folder into a folder

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,120
called services and there's a thing

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,980
called treat debugging and then go debug

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:40,200
true yes lil bit further down and then

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:44,680
we take cash and say falls to that and

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:48,790
then I go back to my site I go come come

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,890
to exercise that yes and so i'm doing

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,410
here is i'm going with to our

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,850
performance and i am of course clearing

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,950
the cache because we still have to do

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,500
that over and over again it's about

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,209
we're working on so he don't have to do

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,020
that if it son you'll see a lot of time

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,940
to do it here Cashman this demo so what

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,400
happens here is she the queen stuff can

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,690
see that all the way down now you can

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,290
all right what is this oh no it

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,990
explains to me where stuff come from

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,180
what is that ok let's look at this

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,310
finally in suggestions this is the file

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,990
names that you can override this part of

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,329
the template with you don't know where

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,540
that templates come from boom core

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,070
modules no templates no HTML tray this

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,660
is how you figure out where stuff come

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,880
from and Google so that thing where you

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,560
sit and hate life for a week because you

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,010
can't feed our wet stuff come from or

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,870
like one doubt people on and I see just

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,510
to figure out where this come from those

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,400
days are now over its size default

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,810
services yeah I don't know why it's

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,880
there and I don't care just nowhere to

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,160
put it in don't put this this is in

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,400
production of course um by the way

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,709
there's an issue for who / 7 and david

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,600
the maintainer 407 agreed it can go in

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,520
so we will at least for the templates in

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,820
drupal 7 has the same you back out but

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,900
so if you find it out if you see it more

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,880
at your +1 on it to get it in as a tool

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,380
a tougher they are of course don't think

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,329
we should push these things back so we

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,779
force you to go up too late that's

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,249
nothing that was a joke brunch okay that

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,989
was installing your theme either thing

00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,089
you're called Lucas till you already see

00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:27,579
how majestic it is right and it looks

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,779
good it looks good so how do you stop

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:34,089
want you to see well here's my theme

00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:36,369
install its people okay now what is in

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,829
the theme it's but because you're brutal

00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,179
is a big badass tree if you up here from

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,459
the Scandinavian plants and you know

00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:44,860
that I have as you can see this looks

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,299
pretty much as you used to the conflict

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,089
pilot they're going to talk about later

00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,489
on but this first look at our info file

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,920
so I am I linked if nations as usual

00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:55,899
have my style sheets I have libraries

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,269
this library points to greet us your

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,029
face so as you can see here on the next

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,860
template the base here is I had a person

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,799
fall and then i have my javascript and

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,679
there and wait a little bit too quick

00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,929
we'll go back to it i also had a little

00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,059
spinner of jay carlin and that is going

00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:16,559
to be really sweet later on and i have a

00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:20,199
very big style sheet for my new theme um

00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,629
alright so what can we do with this well

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,939
here's my new flea in the Lucia it looks

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,309
pretty majestic by this is Drupal 7 8 in

00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:28,869
all its going now this is more to show

00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:30,639
you how you can do one of the things I

00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:32,439
really like to do removing stuff so

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,730
here's all the crap that you post things

00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,919
that should put out to me underneath

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,139
these policies because as you can see I

00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,419
only need one little piece of style and

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,459
science if we move is a new command we

00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:45,069
have now found the for my info file

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:48,369
where we can ask you say hey remove

00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:50,589
these CSS files permanently so we don't

00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:54,220
have to use that foad technique we used

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:56,499
to wear your collar and CSS files that

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,299
Dominic says so jubileus tum and forgets

00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:01,029
about it you can actually just remove

00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:06,279
them so in this case I'm going to end up

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:09,279
only having my own own CSS file and the

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,529
last one oh yeah so here we have another

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,269
come one Jake I mean I won't have J

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,010
climbing up my output because i'm going

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,230
to add a new version of it all just

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,860
look at it so I comment that stuff out

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,350
of my library I reload my page and boom

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,540
only my javascript files in that is how

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,880
you basically manipulate the overall

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,040
like external files you put in and

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,450
that's how you actually exchanged your J

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,930
private person if you don't think the

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:37,480
blade is fast enough in that people so

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,000
basically status you remove is a way to

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,100
command and tell us is the CSS files I

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,170
don't want to have if you want to remove

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,170
our adding libraries JavaScript

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,230
libraries you put that in your Indian

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,390
folk i live in dependency and this is by

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,010
the way to go home swords man all right

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:58,030
variables how do they look at available

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:01,600
in this thing well let's look at that so

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:03,880
I want to figure out how can they came

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:11,890
out with my note and I want to speak

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:16,090
things up so one we get that up in first

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:22,570
we have to have to install just develop

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:25,260
the whole module and also here you can

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,260
cost to do that

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,389
kids tint is the Lightroom oh but just

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,160
for two blade otherwise change that I

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,870
somebody who's no stop accident that but

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,610
King detected new way we're going to do

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,310
this so what I'm going to do yes I'm

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,100
taking available say kintz on it as a

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,350
function and then as it just to pump out

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,999
all the content so I can see ok what's

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:54,379
actually inside my available

00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:57,230
trusting eyes Josh do casual sorry

00:14:54,379 --> 00:15:00,829
castroville yeah insten it's the new CC

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,230
instead of clear cache is dead ok so

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,480
here we get all the different data I

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,970
directly out out of here so I can see I

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,920
have my fuel tax I have an image I have

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,499
a body image or further down to it and

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,309
that way now begin to see what I can do

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:18,980
with these rebels and like even go in

00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:20,689
and as you see here ok what is in my

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,569
text because we're going to do some fun

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:31,570
stuff about tax related again a clear my

00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:33,820
cache I believe he'll go

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:39,430
and here's all the beautiful data that

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:43,180
comes out that comes out of our auto

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,390
attacks so this is basically how you

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,480
inspect what is in your site and that's

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,430
all good and fine so I haven't simply

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,080
and I want to do over right then I'll

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,050
move stuff around I don't want to do

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,940
that with this place we or context or

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,460
cut thing I want to control it directly

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,130
for my templates so what you do that and

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,710
this is not going to be really fun is

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:09,070
just want to play like something no here

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,810
go so let's say I want to move the tax

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,150
that's placed down here on loop then we

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,350
run a column for itself on the left and

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,710
I've got half my images and all that

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,150
stuff or 1 divided said so I have two

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,370
days you can see left and right this is

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,020
really a bad stuff what I'm doing first

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm taking the content available and I

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,680
say okay print this without the fuel tax

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,410
so basically it's a plumb bob anything

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,720
that's in the content but without the

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:37,720
content of fuel text again I clear my

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,280
cache and we go or once you were bad

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,170
princess hurry that was not like six

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,510
year not but now is going to be fun so

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,610
how are you all right that was so early

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,320
ass through the debugging I'm like oh

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm gonna figure out where is this come

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,010
from just between my sister I have a

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,930
shame and this is why this is where the

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,750
fields comes from comas insistence if

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,580
its field it's a long way from home so

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,560
gonna find that override cheese from

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,550
home

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:14,060
isn't that normal to like a reception we

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:16,370
then take that someplace come on and

00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,060
then we figure out what name to execute

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:22,339
so you go about it the right place so

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,530
see here you can see it has a little

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,199
styles or out of these but it has an X

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,580
down the bottom it's the exit simply so

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,230
when you open up your source you look

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,910
into your template and look into the

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,460
sort like what is actually execute you

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,830
can see that on the X so I always have

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,900
my deal this is eli's you get control

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:43,490
with simply this is what I still within

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:51,200
and so I gave it that wrong no no fuel

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:55,610
build yah yah yah as you can see you we

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,040
now have control over the stuff of

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,310
course disappeared

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,850
an outsourced me that this file is now

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,880
built on my templates and it's not built

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,770
from google coiling more alright so next

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,570
up and this is of course and shape this

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,940
mock-up and create something I want to

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,110
do by myself castle that's what we do in

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,060
the front they do always have

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,860
difficulties we want to choose out so

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,250
it's not about just ripping things off

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:26,010
as I and I've seen in this thing I I'm

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:28,690
going to eat them and see here move move

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,370
but I'm necessarily must I think might

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:35,500
actually be in a section instead so by

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:37,180
having an intersection and what I'm

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,280
going to do is a sports as you hear that

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:44,710
X not cheating is this live code so the

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,680
next thing is to give you a little bit

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,890
of classes that are not going to use and

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,880
and then I'm going to do these loops so

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,900
I'm going to say ok if you're in the

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,200
first loop and do this else if you're in

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,210
the last blue to do this if you are in

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,660
takes number two you're gonna do some

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,460
super special as well for you then I'm

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,840
going to take the item the item is the

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,970
thing that can be spit out drug deals

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,130
the data and I just when I had a class

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,179
to all of them the best else command

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,139
down here

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,429
in this one like the default I speed it

00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,440
up a little bit because it took forever

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,700
to say the right also it looks like I'm

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,080
really feeling know what I'm doing right

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,970
let's face it when you can be cold stuff

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,559
you can kind of stop and check out the

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,210
state's XO when you break your side for

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,690
time what we need I'm not going to show

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,309
you that anyways here we go here's what

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,679
I do mark up the lecture Ada and the

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,470
Drupal didn't explode by not having six

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,779
thousand little elements in it so I have

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,240
a little bit of a telecom down here and

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:49,129
I have some some colors that I want to

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,230
use and so I'm going to add them in

00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:55,549
different places just for the fun of it

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,379
so on my second a second number of texts

00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:58,909
coming up I want to add a teleclass

00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:03,249
let's see if that actually happens as

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:06,320
well so the blue should already and

00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:08,990
as only the class customized by me the

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,669
class name I wanted to get India and so

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,070
let's do something out of this may be a

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,080
little bit dumb but also fun so you saw

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,600
all these things called pivot column

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,950
names when I have these columns in so

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,450
what we're doing is with drilling and

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,749
this is another way you can draw into

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,840
Drupal core into a intertrade we really

00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:28,460
don't on when we can hopefully joe says

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,710
that we're gonna have this space so in

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,749
the release so what i'm doing here is

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,210
i'm taking the item i'm dragging it out

00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:37,009
only the title this is not as elegant as

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,990
it could be i know i said that it had 30

00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:41,330
occasions this is one of the things

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,399
because to the way to concern was wrong

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,889
we can't do it this moment we're trying

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:52,779
to figure out how to do that and here we

00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:52,779
have it in class names so

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,520
here's another thing that's say so I

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,380
open my new first I want to do more fun

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,270
stuff I just want to do a count of how

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,280
many tax i have and i want to think of

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,350
it it's single or google and i just want

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,820
to write that out directly I kind of

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,920
don't want to provide it preprocess

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,510
function at us the counting kind of

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,510
things a little bit dumb to do that

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,250
stuff the funded so I'm certainly there

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,820
in the new place to say if you have more

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:23,720
than one do inside you know more than

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,750
one do you attack else you are text and

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:32,780
here you see how clever I aren't chasing

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:35,030
on the index Delta not on the counter as

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,790
we can see here I think themselves I go

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:39,830
back and I just like my mistakes but

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,390
what do you think how many how many

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,300
times have we look through this stuff

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:49,960
let's see what does they give us come on

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,960
wheels good stuff

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:58,200
oh damn it I caught this alt worthy hey

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,060
it always happens yeah now you now you

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,710
clap I'll just show you how we whip

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:07,490
through everything in dude I gotta you

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:09,630
made a mistake god damn it that's fine

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,430
anyways that was the principal Rogers

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:16,830
use a loop there bacon inside that

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:19,470
simply and wondering what a fine if

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:23,010
you're using user data as a class you

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:27,600
should use dish escape and then HTML

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:29,730
etre because of users might be doing

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,520
nasty things because the others kids at

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,020
free test does not work for classes and

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,880
because you need two different is king

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,620
strategy for that yes okay so another

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,260
thing you saw before I just ripped out

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,460
one element ality whole content so then

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,960
screaming at how that looks what you

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,860
want to do that more time so here's my

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,570
here's my fuel tax and she's a contact

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,510
without an idiot I have those fuel tank

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,670
then pi comma separating it even letting

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,650
interest rate up months both of them so

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,590
I'm kind of removed few tags and

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,150
comments and the fuel image I removed

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,870
them for my contents of that whatever

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,220
print it out and then I just want to

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,520
separate them out of course print them

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,850
out another place do that if I do it

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:19,530
content dot and then you know that feels

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,610
so you i want to put out of mine my

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,480
comments

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:28,730
and let's go or what hand is remove the

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,730
linksys all yes we are links

00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,400
unless you what that does

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,750
oh but they wander still wonders what

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:47,070
you knew so this is exit beta just how

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:51,000
you rebuild and you you modify your move

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,700
stuff around in Jubilee I do think this

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,220
is pretty damn hard to be honest but

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,880
it's not how does this trade clocks so

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,850
it drool we have a block and in trick we

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,760
also have a block because confusion

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,250
would be good and anyway the trade block

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,350
is a part of a template that you can you

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,600
can modify on so let's say we have the

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,399
front page of our site we want to change

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,779
that front plate want to change just an

00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:18,059
element of that that needs another

00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,190
header thing that says welcome to my

00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,080
page and I don't want to do that with

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,320
blocks and configure all that stuff on

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,480
how to fix that no I just want to do it

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,090
in my template so we do it like this so

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,230
I'm going to put a block in here and

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,409
what we're going to do I'm going to do a

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:37,590
defined block first not give it up as

00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:41,190
soon lead for this session it's kool Moe

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,870
Dee king is awesome that is this is my

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,820
block and my clogs going to have a dip

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,190
in in with it I know on the diff kill of

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,179
a decent Kennedy just to show you ma'am

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:58,370
also how soft can do it I'll give it a

00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:58,370
green class text to it I am trick part

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,430
and so as you can see never do a block

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,670
and in bubbly like give it a name that

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,530
name we're going to use in a second so

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:13,110
what it does do here that just got to

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,000
print itself out we have not yet told

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,500
the trick season that you need to do

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,420
something with this so the way you do

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,270
that is you look at the play that puts

00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,790
all this data up that's my place and NC

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,490
okay which of these templates do I want

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,430
to use to do this at the painter or at

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,020
the page con or the paint's email which

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:35,250
of these places do we want to know about

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,460
this part of of my sight so I've over

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,860
here i'll just copy my my my from a

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,320
paste HTML to a file a cover my new blog

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,780
i'm not on page one it's you know cover

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,290
that block out then i do the magic of

00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,290
extends

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,580
and this is the second effort you

00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:03,649
remember the exact syntax or achieve it

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,649
there are no extensions out extend

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,229
themes and so I'm planning to my theme

00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:12,090
folder because ill which is my my things

00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:14,580
about templates and paint it you know

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:18,389
saying okay this file when you hit paste

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:21,450
intimal trick and you are you have a

00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:25,019
cold space test runs at that point

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:27,299
exchange this part of template so let's

00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,399
reload please and see what happens to

00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,440
see how now on the front page it's true

00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:34,109
that see what happens when I go into

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,989
another place it's green now this is how

00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,279
it is extend on FB all of your templates

00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:40,679
you can do that all the way down to a

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,950
field so you can begin to how about you

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,200
really begin to trap your things up just

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,909
one little note on that you put in the

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,369
whole path there and you can do that and

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,559
but we have I'm pretty sure it now an

00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:54,359
aptitude test this out just make sure

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,400
that we actually I was working you

00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,170
should get the relative to place

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,560
so you have all these templates here

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,440
page is melted and any also of your page

00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,470
print personally

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,840
where he should have to cook a whole

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,970
and it also reference other base things

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,049
with us pat symbol whatever the name of

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,030
the page

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,030
and

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,890
so there's a number of ways that we will

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:26,600
look through the process to find the

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:29,240
right there as testament sure it

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,030
actually works you have any extended its

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,250
that wet trick is only looking at the

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,930
file system in the drawer pass that it's

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,290
a little more hopefully you can

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,580
recommend bae systems going and the

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,400
reason I did this with actually because

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,690
it wasn't working I felt like an idiot

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,230
though it was the AOS a couple of weeks

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,200
ago thats coping flame so all right so

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,240
here's a really sexy thing adly removed

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,740
classes from a new target perform a

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,530
template plus of that mean well this is

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,900
the part of the banana consensus that we

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,300
want to be able to from our template to

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,280
control everything that comes out and

00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,810
gave us a class name from Drupal so the

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,180
dual system will give us different

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,150
variables that we can work with and then

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:14,000
set a template we can add class limit of

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,910
classes from what trait file so how do

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,970
we do that here's my nose and I expect

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,460
this when I look through it and say okay

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,810
and all of these classes and we all know

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,520
that of course I don't need them because

00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,050
what will need the form so i want to

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,760
change them to something specific if

00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,990
they're all I want to change I want to

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,330
know they don't wanna call the notes

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,280
have any more kind of like content type

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,860
because that's how I normally say it all

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,370
gets confused about it this is hard code

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,550
then go in and you see this can't this

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:45,890
waiting for that sign children so

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,900
children is just say kata kata and then

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,420
the note front which is the name of the

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,250
cons inside and then this clean class

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,200
has been Vincent so I'm going to take

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,520
that part that's bearable that julep

00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,170
send us I'm going to end in to our

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,580
classes as we look the patron see what

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:07,160
happens here boom I have now overwritten

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,200
and controlled to lose classes there was

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,900
no more control of what my classes is

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,210
anymore that I do think is truly goddamn

00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,680
sexy and and here's the thing you can

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,300
still use don't do all these things

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,790
because they'll just have it as to who

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,220
puts it out but I can control it as I

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,410
want to know anyway I am what kind of

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,480
cop it comes out google that we have a

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,090
rear ended to go and replace and remove

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,950
them and so what I want to do here is

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,750
I'm just going to chest on my note if I

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,770
know it's placed on the front page what

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,780
I want to do I want to give them a

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,830
specific class and if it's not on the

00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,740
front page I want to give it another

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,840
cast common example so what I'm doing is

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,030
saying okay mr. on that's all apparel

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,670
and if you a question mark with again

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,490
and it fells if it's if it's front then

00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:52,220
you issuance then the colon and then not

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:55,700
fun and here by the way you can see a

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,050
beautiful Aaron's of it I remove the

00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,060
rest of this data cuz we don't need it

00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,430
right now screw that and let's just see

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,700
if you can add a front class kinloch has

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:10,120
again go back so my my King has been

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:15,400
what we look at so not fun and was a

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,400
comment happens and look at this

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,260
this is now we're not in the front what

00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:33,409
do we think that happens when I go to

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:33,409
the homepage anybody John can you guess

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:45,010
and there we go is front so we can now

00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,410
control our classes from the template

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,600
layer directly without Drupal doing

00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,040
anything and reprocess anything from a

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,130
module and say there's a module that

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,660
adds a class like high warden I hit you

00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,450
class which i'm pretty sure drew will

00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,550
does regularly i can then going to check

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,410
that class and remove that crap the

00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:06,010
reason for that is to say you have you

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:09,940
are working on a GSS with a bootstrap

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,350
all foundation or whatever kind of CSS

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,690
framework you're working with that has a

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,770
class name that Drupal also uses then

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,180
you're going to have a conflict you

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,100
don't want to have that in your theme

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,170
you can go and you can remove that stuff

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,270
or you can change that stuff and then we

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,390
can ask you you don't have to have

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,880
different themes and CSS frameworks to

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,470
battle with each other just at that same

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,660
point and there's some people working

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,640
right now to separate the classes that

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,720
are actually used for javascript from

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,880
the classes that are used for

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,160
presentation so the class abilities were

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,560
just returning today

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,530
attributes hopefully we're working on

00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,120
that right now but that allows you to

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,250
know like Oh and remove this class that

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,110
it won't affect my javascript is blowing

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:55,710
up and so we're trying to get makeup

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:56,940
chance yes yeah I need you if you have

00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,860
developed when you get really like

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,450
freaked out like hey my new module

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,650
should add a class because I need that

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,020
because something something something

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:06,240
well here's how to do that you're going

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,980
you have we still have to add huh we

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,040
still have two classes you can add in

00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:14,160
that array is object whatever that thing

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,530
the class object is still there so you

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,990
can still add stuff to it just from the

00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,790
thin layer we can we can we can work

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,530
with that so from a module developers

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,210
figure out develop expects it you have

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,830
the freedom to do what you want and from

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,510
the thin layer we also have the freedom

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,220
to do what you want so that whole thing

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,960
of us clashing and not figure out what

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,550
classes and stuff you want to happen we

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,620
have removed that and that is because of

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,170
the banana that's why we love to banana

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:42,780
and okay here's the thing how many he

00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:44,460
loves to do menu theme Jonah open is the

00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,320
only one who put his arm on by the way

00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,110
everything around us wrong with google

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,570
sevens team layer is John's fault

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,310
because he was the only Lima where you

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,050
worked on that part that means we're

00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:59,040
going to assign blame to him thank you

00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:00,750
John for your wonderful work all right

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,760
so this is one of the things that we've

00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,890
got in about last week and this is the

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,140
reason I have to trash all my own slides

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,090
because this is so goddamn sex you won't

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,850
believe it let's look at this so I want

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,880
to see the menu and this would normally

00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,890
make you hate life for weeks right so I

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,410
know how I look at my menu is there a

00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:26,460
what is going on here the c1 yes hello

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:29,730
so here's my menu colorful years at the

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,100
menu and I have going to sacrifice could

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,830
this be could this be viewing

00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,679
I love you that has everything in it is

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:39,809
a leading question anybody case we all

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,590
got the menus and it's yours as actually

00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:46,440
in there from dead over a woman theme

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,330
and cheering personal I do nicely for

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,919
the consumers and I thought it down in

00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,559
here so I don't want to go invite all of

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,690
my menus I only wanted over by one menu

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,710
that's the main menu right that's the

00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,870
only 1i want to touch so here we have

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:06,059
menu test Ashley you see the patent

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:07,320
system is your time damages so the

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,940
states is falling apart because

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,669
apparently there's a two hopper to hand

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,260
so anyways so here's my judgment menu

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,270
examiner had this one min you tell me

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,460
that I've been able to menu- menu test

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,020
ash mean to override it and this is my

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,850
evil laugh and when I was calling to

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,679
figure out this extra work this is what

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,590
this has been a thing we've been working

00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,830
on talked about for years as you for two

00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,840
years by since June community I spend on

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:34,470
I just wanna do something with okay

00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,450
let's go dancing so yeah this is the

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,060
macro we call calling to if you're not

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,129
going to talk about markers like to do

00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,570
that later on and so what I'm going to

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:45,480
do is I'm going to say okay filled up

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,399
the menu they will seal our ad in a

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,109
specific class for that it would be

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,149
really also if I could add in you know a

00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:53,100
class beats level and this without

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:55,560
having to call for different resources

00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:59,160
and figure out where to push this data I

00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:03,210
have all my data right here so we're

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,369
using any excuse at class so if I'm on

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,980
the menu level one I will have this cars

00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,830
on any of the other levels what I want

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,470
to do I just want to eat children Thomas

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:18,990
is it which level I'm on so I can do a

00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:22,830
menu menu test as little as see the

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,660
pumping in my own a few left menu del

00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:28,839
pez concern

00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:32,780
so that he used to read it and then say

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,369
we built cashing in it's getting kind of

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,549
teachers do that people has a thing like

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:40,339
by my left hand and I have that in just

00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:47,150
gonna said if you just go on okay here

00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:49,099
we go when you live one how many hours

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,069
and three forces to this stage it's

00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,180
stupid very good ol days and I'll tell

00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:58,460
you what I do here if I had another

00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:00,289
class as well you lose so there were

00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,140
once so I know this is my little ones

00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:05,180
ignores always motivated this also

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,160
reference ballet to talk John is

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,680
relative later on but talk about this

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,440
result about how we have defined our new

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,720
CSS augmentation that we have if we have

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,849
time for a min point to that I took the

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,420
demo files first because i had an

00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:23,650
unhittable to hold on I'll in the class

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,650
again it's you have

00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,590
yeah so I found them I'm figure out

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,150
either putting this refund is always a

00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,100
thing I've been handing in Google like

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:45,020
this leave class you guys remove that as

00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:48,410
well since eat slowly learning let's go

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,300
unenforced of us holy crap this actually

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,340
hope you lose let's let's kill a little

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,870
bit more classes just for fun because

00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,970
that's kind of a thing I like to do be

00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,680
able to customize moment things all the

00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,480
way down and I think we figured out that

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,970
we might gonna have to work on spit out

00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,100
a way to detect if a module or your

00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,300
template has assets inside of them but

00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,630
it's going to be anything we're gonna

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,650
work on their own but now we have a menu

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,360
that I have defined exactly as I wanted

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:17,900
with the classes as we kill that

00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:21,140
clairsville this is my venue out of

00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:26,020
drupal one menu 17 JS file and i can do

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,020
with it what I want he says now we clap

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:36,320
example no but you in the way your theme

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,210
dinner worked really hard to get that in

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,830
there and i'll probably my favorite

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:45,050
template in there because i remember

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:46,660
trying to use the tree mandatory the

00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,140
money tree does not have any contact

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,420
many variables it has a ul and the glass

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,540
menu and maybe change that if you wanted

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,730
as much as you can deal with that this

00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,580
now allows you that that level thing is

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,560
almost impossible to do in Drupal 7 it's

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,820
not fully one move it it's almost

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,700
impossible and that makes your menus a

00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,200
lot more flexible what so just kind of

00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,480
want to give a hand up to the dinner and

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:22,120
that all young people work tonight this

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:23,860
is not an issue probably a savory unique

00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,470
that's two years of discussing it

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:30,310
together how sweet this for here's

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:34,030
another for example the pager besides of

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:36,580
John who likes to theme a pager okay if

00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,870
i say to you that pages now 67 lines of

00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,540
template children you can do with it

00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,400
what you want oh yeah exactly so let's

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,830
take a look at that it's inspector

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,050
already yeah my patient and it puts out

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,210
this by the way weird so the class names

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,300
you trying to do it they've whole CSS

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,680
name's Kim how we're doing that so it's

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,880
all pretty it's all good out of the box

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,630
but they say I want to do something

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,910
specific to it so I again again I do my

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,920
whole probably the template / renaming

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,020
it here just kind of like all the pages

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,420
in the world i doing on page i'm going

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,890
to remove that you ll right because i

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,600
want to it but span tax with that

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:14,140
because that's just how I want to have

00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,970
my my mark up today so I'd saying all

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:20,450
the

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:20,450
lifehacks move them make it to a span

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,430
know something as well

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:41,030
yes Jamal young good it's short cash oh

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:44,330
yeah let's say the picture I two minutes

00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:45,790
either it's exit this is between closet

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:49,550
just so you can see amazing are fabulous

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:52,700
let's sort of you know that again that's

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,430
your pager that's all future of the

00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,350
painter looks like this and then Adam

00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,359
remove myself as I once again detective

00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:01,310
what I want to panic at work but is that

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,170
really had wanted and this is the matter

00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,840
for the optimal move these parts of our

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,490
could each one text all over it go and

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,140
do something completely different you

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,970
have all that in I just wanted to give a

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,830
shout out to LA we're sitting right in

00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,810
front of here and and looking for

00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,510
kicking ass on this subject it has been

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:19,280
a pain in the ass but used to do

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,869
pages there's kind of the most hated

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,760
thing I don't get as a funding to be

00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:24,619
liked by the way the client has to get

00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,570
this in the picture and like dot damn

00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:27,800
it's going to take him fall into 60

00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,140
hours and people going to think I'm a

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,910
bigger moment that it used to be now I

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,500
actually have to bet control of this

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,359
file and there's even there were

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,130
comments inside of the heat if the

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,109
Eclipse names if I want to do something

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,660
else than having three dots I'll have a

00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:50,210
little emoji icon there I just put it in

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:51,890
that is a piece of you alright so this

00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,570
is just a basic thing here's another

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,700
thing you know what a lot by doing a new

00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,859
thing when I'm going to move my theme I

00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,780
have to get all of my image styles with

00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:02,240
me have to reinstall them I do it

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,010
normally in a feature move day or what

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,030
Drupal 7 and then something breaks and I

00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,500
hate my life here's a sweet thing about

00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,900
cmi that I was not aware of until

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,570
however months ago without like I wonder

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,240
if I can install an in style directly

00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,850
with my theme so here's with Julie party

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,100
version and it has a images and just to

00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:26,080
see Joey I'm not cheating this is my

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,900
limit styles directly vanilla yeah I

00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,490
want any any stance and all this

00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,290
2.beijing what I want to do how I

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:40,630
installed and if it's time with my team

00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:43,570
how do we do that Oh up here we have in

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:45,520
the country I have an epic style- files

00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:49,810
called Odin because of your oldest

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,360
badass and this is a case file as we

00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:54,670
love you you can argue with it so let's

00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,440
hear by his mother official teen is

00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:02,080
false let's go down aluminum stars oh

00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,750
 i installed anywhere sighs

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,340
everything with my theme so now when you

00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,220
pack the themes you can actually move

00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:15,130
certain as far as an ounce is that can

00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:18,490
see the light of day and so um tell this

00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,890
below this here's my here's my is my

00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,570
opening let's say all the way the

00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,300
modified I don't want be saturated water

00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:27,690
is going to beat that no reason to help

00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,690
anyone

00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,860
so what I want to do now so make sure

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,930
next time is wrong with you as you're

00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,820
gonna update my human style so my name

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,740
is Stan out of it there's just resized

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,600
it to a thousand times something

00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,800
something I now think spot in my culture

00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:48,230
Jimmy styles and I go down and I five in

00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,250
bit cities and somehow gave me a false

00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:56,300
let's try that again so to look through

00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:58,730
the ESU dome here's my coat so this is

00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,580
this piece in the configuration hope

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,860
that you will forget and the image style

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,770
or in the other files they are like a

00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:11,270
snow-covered start over and I think then

00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:13,100
I remove the you ID on it so you don't

00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:15,200
end up having issues with one side stop

00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,390
kilometer other side it cost me a pain

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,230
in the ass a long time so just to show

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:25,940
it off so this all I'm install my theme

00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:28,180
on installing the nearest i'll delete

00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,180
that

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:32,769
catching over people showing videos of

00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,559
this I wasn't pretty sure that they are

00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:37,420
totally cheating on that just like tar

00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,009
there's little annotations in there but

00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,119
it's actually not so now I don't have my

00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:42,119
costume all right

00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,000
alright so install we install the

00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,520
resulting Avengers to see if my newest

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,940
files actually change this time let's

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,650
see how to reload the page of course

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,990
assume there's change we missed our

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:09,790
bachelor dinner cruise outdated just

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:13,090
before and a safe save it those days

00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:15,820
really lets you change voila you can now

00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,800
import export in it stars which are

00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,980
things you can actually do a lot things

00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,590
here you can change your settings and

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,960
stuff your shootings but there's

00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:28,450
possibilities here that we've got just

00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,580
only trust in the layer so that's a new

00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,680
one is eloping besides of that we have a

00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:36,580
ton of you shiny things how much time

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,410
that works 50 G's okay so this is going

00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,240
to be so here's the thing you saw that

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,070
the theme boom is that we have not added

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,080
logic so you can put your themes into

00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:46,600
the themes folder in your call side I

00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,340
know it's like it's Tracy you don't have

00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,680
to like look look like the new kitty the

00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:56,650
most that's way too long as sad news for

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,420
you if you are into I six I 70 I ate two

00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,580
lanes not going to support that sorry

00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:07,600
for that we're going to go straight up

00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:11,200
html5 unity of the largest nine months

00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,440
of my life on it added kind of training

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,070
people leaving the issue queue ID s no a

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,750
note with an IP on is no more this is

00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,460
how an article look now if you really

00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,620
want to have your article I have an ID

00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,330
on this is how you put it in so those

00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,730
five people in the world wanna have an

00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,500
ID on that note to select because that's

00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,900
the thing with your use you don't do

00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,710
that in or be removed almost every

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,780
goddamn idea we could find yes here is

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,910
another little one you all know the form

00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:43,540
that has that div inside of it that we

00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,310
really need it is gone this my first has

00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,540
ever

00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:51,960
years ago I got it out yes Thank You

00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,840
html5 away and talk about changing to

00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,670
CSS how Drupal 8 your business is it we

00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,590
actually sat down and talked about that

00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,390
from a front-end perspective which

00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,760
matters do we want to use we're gonna

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,020
use maximum value some been living John

00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,410
who's sitting right here is doing a

00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,270
session later when tomorrow tomorrow

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,710
three children lot about this as well as

00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,110
he's been like the lead on that so we

00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:16,230
actually have a decent naming convention

00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:18,690
and KS prefix doc if you have a class

00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,430
that JavaScript puts out because you

00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,800
need it then jewel is not going to

00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,690
prefix that with jas so you never again

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,240
when you kill all the clouds from use

00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,710
makes make sure that the Ajax call

00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,860
doesn't work getting open cause there's

00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,080
actually a place that says hey Jas don't

00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,760
remove that and what not though is

00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,830
saying that you should use data

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,540
attributes with that this is also known

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,060
as the theme of don't this class up

00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,520
and but using data appears instead that

00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,950
means make secure the logo is no more

00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,370
doable oh I've got new team engine these

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:52,560
functions are yet I am so sorry for that

00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,660
and we have templates instead we have to

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,240
have a lot of template so developers who

00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,340
is trying for that I won't even try in a

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,010
big cup and I'm going to do coffee on

00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,660
that and enjoy its morning template

00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:07,170
files are there are functions it's a big

00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:10,020
thing as in jewel said we have 35 cents

00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,880
from 150 for different functions in

00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,890
Google eight right now we have 21

00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,390
functions we are hopefully going to have

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,880
civil team functions when we go to

00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,430
release candidate one and at this point

00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,770
we have 149 templates at last count

00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:28,050
we're trying to minimize these it's a

00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:29,460
lot of work but that's so serial

00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:33,690
functions and see what's in place in

00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,310
juvenile all right so no you will do

00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,590
that the Christian thing what I'm doing

00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,870
by how to create faq of question that we

00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,330
thought over the last 12 years the first

00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,920
one is sex and relate i know that ninety

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,900
percent of us

00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,660
you said no we're not going to have sets

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,069
down into port hole as you saw first of

00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,770
all you can remove just use as father

00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:54,650
then do what you want so that's just how

00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:57,079
it's going to be seven into blade why is

00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,690
it not told eight well here's the thing

00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,750
seven is a name it's actually a string

00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:05,690
it's not a number so that's why I saw me

00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:08,359
you don't rename your kids 12 and three

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:12,230
right so that's why it's called sediment

00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:14,210
okay headless drupal trait okay holy

00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:16,549
crap we get more passwords into one

00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:19,040
sentence if you're doing a hitlist Rugal

00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:20,660
you can't figure it out yourself PSP

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,030
template what if I really want to use P

00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,740
said they thought you can still do that

00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,960
you can send a few million rupees be

00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:30,650
typically then rewrite all of the feel

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,210
for templates and the functions and the

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,309
add/remove class and all the other stuff

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,290
and then figure it out so have fun I

00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:38,119
don't know why we've had it and here's

00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,549
the thing I've accused john for epic

00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,470
fail the Drupal 7 5 years he was

00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:45,079
actually just trying to like not making

00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,760
chocolates if it fails i got this

00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,109
question a lot of times if this feels

00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,670
more now you have been dealing about

00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:52,460
this for five years and been trying to

00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:54,200
put this board is it your fault yes it

00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:58,640
is and i will take full responsibility

00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:01,430
for that um bootstrapping call nope

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,069
that's not going to happen there's an

00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:07,670
issue for this that has a lot of fun

00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:08,839
tenders for really apeshit so no that's

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,250
not going to happen that's actually the

00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:13,280
whole idea what we ought to do this

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,869
banana feasible by being able to add in

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,480
what we want that what we need to eat

00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,579
from jooble call back portraiture Jubal

00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,040
cell have fun with that we're not going

00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:23,930
to do that dragon to offer you I so you

00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,589
saw that whole whole thing while like

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:29,329
moving stuff around or in contribute

00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,190
might have to create some kind of

00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:32,809
modulating two tix if you have

00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,700
overridden everything because there is

00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:37,579
some UI control ourselves and Jubal

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,020
eight other discussions we had way back

00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,730
was how do you want to have to wait too

00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,170
long have everything controlled by a

00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,500
template or should everything be

00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:48,079
controlled from at you I the besides of

00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,050
one person two years ago in the room of

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,700
this size where we ask that

00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,550
there was one person that wounded want

00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,620
to have that you I because she was I was

00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,920
likely to do it was uncomfortable by

00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,660
working directly descendants and that

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,520
was the only time we have heard from a

00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,470
front end was facing that anybody wanted

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,610
the UI so that's one of the decision

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,730
that we're trying to push everything

00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:11,770
into cent wings another thing I heard

00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,560
that's a christian i got from from one

00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:15,880
person yesterday was like is it

00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,610
scandinavians off he was the loudest so

00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:23,500
i kind of want to figure that out so can

00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:26,820
i get a sound from the things whoo okay

00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:31,500
can't get us down from the skinny

00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:36,130
even John all right I'm sweet but yes oh

00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,050
that's why we have that much beef all

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,000
right so June has the hashtag do

00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,680
betrayed here's the thing if you think

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,510
that what we have done so far is pretty

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,130
awesome or is pretty much failing when I

00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,960
help out and you do want to help up

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:49,180
because we have a long road starts go we

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,770
are far deep down where we want to be

00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,500
and actually we further down than

00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,940
asphalt will be hashtagged Rugal trade

00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,040
we use that on trailers like a noun

00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,380
stuff but it's also the I HD channel

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,690
that we're using and it's kind of the

00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,220
place to do that do all that stuff the

00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,200
using the really don't just call it

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,090
triggers first of all it's impossible to

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,210
Twitter to use trade just a word and

00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:13,570
it's all not to be confused with the

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:16,180
trade projects and another thing tonight

00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,520

have control our classrooms now we can

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,160
override everything google puts out we

00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,320
can detect under we can change that it

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,360
that is a piece of Ewing and that

00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,640

to end up being of his pal also our

00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,340
popcorn and we know that at the same

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:01,100
time there's also the women to clean up

00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,810

more or less all nights just if you

00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,020
