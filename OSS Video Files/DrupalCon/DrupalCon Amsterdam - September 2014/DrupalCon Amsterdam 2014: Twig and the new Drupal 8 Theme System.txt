Drupal 8 will have a fancy new template engine (Twig) and a simplified theme layer. We'll show you the new syntax (don't worry, it's easy) and walk through how you can actually use Twig in your every day lives.

Are you a theme developer? Come see how consistent, easy, and straightforward it will be to create your own custom themes.
Do you maintain contributed modules? Come learn what you need to do in order to adapt your code for Drupal 8.
In this session some of your friendly Drupal 8 theme system co-maintainers will walk through the state of Drupal 8's theme system. We'll talk about what's different from Drupal 7 but also walk through some of the internals of different aspects of the theme system and how they might affect your day-to-day work with Drupal.

Topics include:

A high-level overview of the changes to the theme system in Drupal 8.
Some of the goodies that are possible now that weâ€™re using Twig as our templating engine.
Using theme hook suggestions to cut down on custom code and have themers thanking you.
Phases of the theme system and where you can step in to alter things.
