00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:40,299
all right thank you first of all want to

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,819
thank you all to being here my name is

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:48,310
you talkin about I'm IT manager at year

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:51,280
old calm and I will first start to say

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:55,000
something about our company what are

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,159
what are we selling online and why we

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,159
started the Drupal project two years ago

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:07,150
eurocom is a one hundred percent

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,120
ecommerce company that means if we only

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,049
sell online so the internet is really

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:19,359
important for us so no offline time is

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:22,629
is good of course and what we do is we

00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:25,989
sell train passes not just train tickets

00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:28,949
where you can travel from A to B but the

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:32,019
train passes so when you want to

00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,689
discover Europe for instance you can buy

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:39,280
a global pass and you can travel through

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:43,389
europe by train and we're in the top 50

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,459
of dutch ecommerce companies and we are

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:51,280
situated in with it and we have 30

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:54,000
employees so that's not a lot i explain

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,009
later why we can do it with 30 people

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,900
and we have an expected turnover this

00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:07,449
year about 60 million dollars euros and

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:12,489
i wish i can keep it all but it's not

00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:15,549
how it works in fact we buy our of the

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:19,799
passes by the ural group which are the

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:23,169
30 european railway companies together

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,349
so they are united in the URL group and

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:30,340
they have products and we buy their

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:35,620
products so we sell them online so in

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:41,050
fact we are an official agent the uriel

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,029
Paul was already introduced in 1959 but

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,930
at that time there was of course no

00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:47,990
ecommerce so

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:53,090
time the Pro Bowl their bosses at the

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:55,039
local train stations so since 2006 we

00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:08,780
started the company just first with one

00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:14,210
person and after did I do that you did

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:17,270
it and so just as one person and LA two

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,690
years ago we were with 18 people and now

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:26,240
a rare 30 so we are growing very very

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:29,449
fast we have three websites we're

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,759
selling the pulses it's the URL com

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,630
interval dot EU and German real puzzle

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,419
calm and why three different websites

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:41,960
that's because the interval project is

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:45,370
only for European residents and uriel

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,990
product for non-european residents

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:52,310
German Rail Pass is just the one country

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:57,889
pass you can travel through Germany of

00:05:52,310 --> 00:06:01,610
course how does our websites look like

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,699
as this is after the project really so

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:09,169
it's the current website sure you can go

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,810
to adopt eurocom and see the website

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,120
look like this I'm not sure if you can

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,690
see it but and the top menu there are

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,380
some some topics of course we have the

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:24,229
pulses you can see we have for URL for

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,150
flavors what I mentioned earlier you

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:29,419
have the global path so you can travel

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,520
through Europe and besides that we have

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,860
the four country path so you can travel

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,930
through four countries the original past

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,590
two countries and the one country pass

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:42,590
of course it's just one country we also

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,570
have information about trains all the

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,370
trains in Europe we have information

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,159
about all the destinations you can

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:53,150
travel to all the countries so these are

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:56,390
really good information that can be kept

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:59,630
in a content type as you can see

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:03,680
our interval website looks pretty much

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,290
the same the the colors are a bit

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,860
different but the tone of voice is

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,820
completely different because we try to

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:18,950
our main customers for interval are

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:21,950
students or graduated people and for

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,310
Ural it's more a once-in-a-lifetime trip

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,080
people from the United States or

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:34,520
Australia coming over to Europe and want

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:38,030
to do a a europe trip so I was talking

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,580
about we only have 30 people and so what

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,710
we are doing in fact is we concentrate

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,600
on everything that has to do with trains

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:50,540
and etc and everything where we're not

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,220
good in and we're experts around the

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:58,280
world like drupal we find a good partner

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:04,010
or supplier that can help us achieving

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,800
our goals so our internal focus is of

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,970
course content migration of content and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,460
media creation so we have a lot of

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:17,000
content writers were right on the

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,970
website but also on our block customer

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,860
service is one of our major points

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:28,400
because we have customer service people

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,380
all over the world so if a guy from

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,900
Brazil has a question it's really good

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,910
that a Brazilian customer service agent

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,430
can reply in it it's this native

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:41,090
language and he knows the culture so it

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,760
is really close by of course it is some

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,370
business development and a strong point

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,480
what we have is the search engine

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:54,140
marketing SEO etc so what do we not do

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,390
for instance their complete payment it's

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,850
done by our gonna and again our

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,520
fulfillment center so once you buy a

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,500
pulse it will directly go to our

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,270
fulfillment center where actually the

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,100
pass is printed and sent to the customer

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,940
you would say why is it not

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,009
tronic yet we have to deal with 30

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:20,120
railway company so it takes a long long

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:26,360
time to have a one decision it's like a

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,370
European wall etc and pasta livery we

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,519
don't do and even the translations we

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,610
don't do we have a special company that

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,220
craps our content from our website as

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:42,230
translated by humans not automatically

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,810
and it's put back on the only website so

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,000
we don't have to worry about the the

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,350
length of the translations we only care

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,350
about the English version of the website

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:59,600
three years ago we had a supplier we are

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:03,410
not pretty happy with we were we had a

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,089
lot of ideas we want to go fast and the

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:12,290
current supplier was really able to to

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:14,899
have that same speed and I think through

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,120
the years we were bigger and bigger and

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:22,459
Falls and Falls and they couldn't keep

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:25,310
us so and also the quality was it not

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,250
dead create so at a certain moment my

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:32,180
management team said okay we start a

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:36,230
website project and we start all over

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:39,800
again with from from hosting to a

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:44,360
complete website layout design so it was

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:49,490
a very big project and and main some of

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,380
the objectives the goals were find a new

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,079
partner non supplier with a partner that

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,259
really thinks with us because we are not

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,660
the experts and we have to rely on what

00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,870
they're at five we'll give it a try they

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,930
gave us and it should be in Europe

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,240
because our translation supplier is in

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,490
the United States and they are good too

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,589
but you always have the time difference

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,139
between Europe and the United States so

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,720
it's really hard to set up a conference

00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,500
call so one of the things okay we have

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,819
to work together very close so it should

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,379
be in Europe

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:30,470
and only with Drupal expert so not doing

00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:33,139
magento no do in Drupal not doing small

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,720
so i do' another CMS system no

00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:42,039
specialist in drupal so there was one

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,619
make sure the website is always online

00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,919
it's now yeah it's always online now but

00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:54,499
at that time two years ago we had a one

00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:58,779
or two our downtime a week so it's for a

00:11:54,499 --> 00:12:05,649
hundred percent ecommerce companies it's

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:05,649
versus increase

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,639
increase the user spinning of

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,279
performance on the locations where our

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,819
customers are and we are selling through

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,920
you throw the world so our markets are

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:28,829
United States Canada Brazil Sydney

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:33,059
Australia especially Sydney and but also

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:35,579
a CO and with only one server at that

00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:40,679
time located in the Netherlands we had a

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:43,860
huge delay in showing the website so and

00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,860
there Alexei will tell you more about it

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,639
in detail there are the CDN comes into

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:54,990
play content management should be super

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:59,699
easy at that time we all my the content

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:02,369
writers should have skill in HTML

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:05,069
because otherwise was not possible to to

00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:07,920
create an article and since they're

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:09,869
trained specialists they do not know

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,389
anything about HTML so you can imagine

00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:17,149
what the page looks like after go like

00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:20,999
that page so it doesn't look very nice

00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:23,879
at that moment we had only web page so

00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:29,939
we had no you a content type whatsoever

00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:32,279
so if we want to change a part of for

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:34,319
instance was one country out of the past

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,259
then we have to change it on 30

00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:39,059
different places so it's ridiculous

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,249
because with the content type you can do

00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,079
it automatically and change it once but

00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:46,589
at that time we are just the content

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:51,509
type web page and now we're a lot of web

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:53,220
pages so and but one of the things is

00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,679
because there were a lot of information

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,160
already there so we had to migrate all

00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,259
the data the content from the old system

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,059
to the new system from an unstructured

00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,850
way to a structured way so you can

00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,850
imagine how much work that was

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:20,670
and then before high season so it was a

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:23,370
bit of time pressure and of course if

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,010
you can have a better system and we can

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,440
make more money and that's where it's

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:36,269
all about for us because we're a

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:40,890
commercial company yeah I will be

00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:46,290
talking about yes yeah we will really

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:49,440
present so one of the things was that we

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,209
had a Drupal supplier that was also our

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,420
hosting supplier and we want to split

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:58,709
that so we would have liked have Drupal

00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,709
specialists and hosting specialists and

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:05,010
the same we have had at that time was an

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:08,070
e-commerce specialist and also a hosting

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,779
so we had double double hosting so for

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,870
the website and for the web shop so

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,940
that's not really very handy so we were

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:20,279
looking for a new Drupal and for a new

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:23,270
housing partner and at the time we had

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:28,529
Drupal 6 so we want to move to and rupal

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:32,130
7 and besides that would be nice to have

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:37,260
a new design that's easy no it wasn't

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:39,270
and of course not just migrating the old

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,529
website to the new one it's which you

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:47,579
will be ready for for the future and

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:49,890
some railway companies are experimenting

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:53,130
with a ticketing so we will take at

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:56,970
least five years from now but it's good

00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:00,300
to have it already there other points

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,660
are API and web services so when we want

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,550
to connect for instance hotels to up to

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,949
our paths it's really happy to have a

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,800
some kind of connection between the two

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:15,209
systems so an API would be very handy

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,950
then and other items that would be very

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:24,960
nice to have

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:28,300
so in the end we took a long time for

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,130
selecting a partner and at that time i

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,480
went to the tuple conan munich and

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,750
that's very nice because there are a lot

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,420
of suppliers and i already had a short

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,730
list so it gives a really good

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,590
opportunity to speak them all to not

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,110
only speak to the sales people but also

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:50,020
to the two technical people and how they

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,680
see things and are they thinking with

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,840
with you or is it just okay i can create

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,200
it i can make that yes no problem at all

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:03,040
it's are they are they working with you

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:08,770
or please you only so it was very nice

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:14,579
so in the end we selected re axiom for a

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:20,290
Drupal partner and a Kia for our hosting

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:23,260
solution and then was before we start

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:27,670
project there are a lot of advantages of

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,460
having all the expertise outsourced but

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,440
there's one disadvantage and it's when

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,430
you start a project like this because

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,290
it's a huge project and all the

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,290
suppliers have to be in sync so if you

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:44,620
change there it can affect the other

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:51,510
supplier so that was a real struggle

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,510
during the project alright

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:03,140
I'm continuing with key steps and the

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:07,190
timeline how we did it actually so the

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:09,230
project was are divided into several sub

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:14,980
project actually the request for

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,980
proposal was received at the end of 2012

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:22,040
we agreed to run the of onboarding to a

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,360
web platform in the beginning of the

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,450
year later we put this Drupal website

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,880
into support maintains by the acts and

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:38,450
also we started the migration path to

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:42,200
Drupal 7 in the beginning of 2014 we

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,710
have released the Drupal website we

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,570
started the support on it and then we

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,690
launched the ecommerce project the huge

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,760
brand new e-commerce project and next

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,890
year we're going to release ignores

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,380
project and will start to iterate with

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:02,300
new features new developments and new

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,920
elements I'll go through all the sub

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,430
projects and project to show you how

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,180
actually we were doing it and what

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:14,300
actions have we have we performed to

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:18,530
accomplish the goal so we'll start with

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:21,670
them boring actually unbore ian was here

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,290
to address plenty goals and objectives

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:27,500
we had to journalize the existing

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,270
problems we had to perform the audit we

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,160
had to correct the security and

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,690
performance issues we had to onboard the

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,900
applications on a new platform we had to

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,260
ensure that there are no functional

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,300
technical directions and if we are

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,970
talking about the steps actually on the

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,240
top of the slide you can see that the

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,970
time frame where when we were performing

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,190
this order task so you can feel actually

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,980
how much time from time to time it can

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,740
take to perform this or that so the

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,929
first step for unborn was of course that

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,039
off boarding

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:10,149
you can see the the checklist icon on

00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:13,059
the left and well actually it's always

00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:15,249
good to use checklists you can put

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,249
things there and you can validate the

00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:20,799
deliverables against this list so it's

00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:23,230
it was really handy for us to do it for

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,440
full of boring so actually while doing

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,169
of boring we were requesting the

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,690
previous supplier to deliver us all the

00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,720
exports all the configuration files we

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,119
were check in with eurocom to see the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,909
latest outstanding accidents on

00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,269
production to focus on on the on the

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:47,649
existent problems later we have to form

00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:51,279
two two audits first of all one was done

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:55,029
on the course site where our colleagues

00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:57,159
from require was were testing the health

00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,259
and security and performance of the code

00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,169
they were analyzing the Customs Service

00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:05,399
servers configurations on our side we

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:08,619
were doing functional discovery and

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:11,080
performance third-party integration just

00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:15,610
to be able to take this application into

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:18,490
support and maintains as soon as the

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:21,279
audit reports were delivered we were

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:24,309
able to define actually the list of them

00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,379
the issues which we are facing most of

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:29,740
them were in the performance and

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,929
security area so we agreed with with our

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,450
colleagues from URLs that to deliver and

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:36,190
to unbore it on the new platform we need

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,429
to correct the critical and blocker

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,679
issues so we won't have any outstanding

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:44,860
security or performance problems as soon

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,249
as it was done we started to work with a

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,619
quiet to prepare the platform so what we

00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:55,769
did we measured with the help of the

00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:55,769
traffic with the help of the server

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,820
resources usage we have measured how

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,910
powerful platform should be we provision

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,760
it later we put all the necessary

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:11,280
configuration in that we adjusted and we

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,970
corrected those configuration to meet

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,390
the best practices which is used by a

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,000
choir and at the other end we put

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,370
applications there we are talking about

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,080
three different applications which are

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:29,330
running on the same code base so it's

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,880
free websites and the same code base as

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,160
soon as the project was on world we

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,650
started to perform the functional and

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,470
performance testing so functional

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:45,390
testing were shared between eurocom our

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:48,300
team and EDX team so so we were ensuring

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,570
that the no functional or technical

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,720
regressions on it of course one of the

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:57,390
important issues was to measure how our

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,060
performance improvement work so we used

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,620
such tools as blaze matter or and blitz

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:06,900
cloud performance testing tools so you

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,270
can see actually after onboarding the

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,050
results were much better than than

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:16,710
before and of course the release were

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:18,750
were planning the way that the risk were

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,810
minimized so we started with the project

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,110
which had less traffic less revenues

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:27,690
were coming from this web project so we

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,580
started from general passes than we

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,250
passed the stabilization period of one

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,940
week and then we on board and activated

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,210
other websites as soon as it was done we

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,540
started that the Drupal 6 support

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:44,340
objectives of course support assistance

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,000
preventive and adaptive maintenance and

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,890
of course SLA as far as the project is

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,740
completely ecommerce and one hundred

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:58,050
percent online while running support

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,470
project we also performed two small sub

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:06,060
project one of them was CDM integration

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:08,220
activation which actually allow us to

00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,930
proved the availability of the website

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:15,180
and performance of the website and such

00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:20,400
painful areas as China Russia countries

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:23,460
of solvent America second sub project

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,090
was integration of automatic testing so

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,100
we integrated the test for the to

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,370
support our continuous integration and

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:36,930
on other side to avoid any any and

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,760
unavailability of the content of the

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,390
major functionalities who performed the

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,580
user flow tests which were executed on

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,140
daily and weekly basis by automatic

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,940
tools and which were delivering the

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,180
report to us saying that this or that

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,630
functionality is available all the time

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,430
in parallel we have started Drupal 7

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:59,490
project so the goals for this project as

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:03,780
was already mentioned by Hugo was to

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:07,760
make the redesign in terms of front-end

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:11,520
to rethink the the architecture to

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,180
improve the content and media sharing

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,930
and of course by making this migration

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:24,300
to ensure that search engine will still

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:28,410
like the site as one of the first step

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,660
we decided to to keep iterating on the

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,730
on the business requirements and non

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,640
functional specifications so start

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,320
starting from the business requirements

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,060
initially and with the functional

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,750
discovery from which was coming from

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:46,230
Drupal 6 website we we made plenty of

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,960
iterations on the on the design on the

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,430
functionalities and it's one of the

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,950
things that we discovered for us it's

00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:58,290
never late to test new things and to

00:25:52,950 --> 00:26:01,140
improve things various architectural

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:06,090
decisions were taken so structured

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:09,150
content no blog system improved sharing

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:13,680
system improved back office product

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:15,480
display and project selection as well in

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,220
terms of development of course we were

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,299
using agile methodology

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,850
fits this project quite well it took us

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:28,380
around 15 Sprint's to release almost

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:32,130
most of them were three weeks springs

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:35,940
but at and when we were finalizing and

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:38,640
stabilizing the the application we

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:45,780
reduce it to one with sprints so

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:48,240
actually our backlog was iterating and

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,820
it was updating all the time with new

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,450
ideas with new things and finally we

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:59,070
decided that three weeks three months

00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:01,080
before the release we will make the

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,750
fries of features and fries of content

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,669
so no more features will be integrated

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,850
into the scope and normal content will

00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:12,320
be added on the current website very

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:17,330
very interesting and very complicated

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:22,020
element for us was the migration path

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:26,940
actually we had to to be sure that after

00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,830
the migration to to Drupal 7 and while

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,720
changing the application changing the

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,169
structure of URL changing the structure

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,350
of the content we want to lose the

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:41,240
availability of the those projects in

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:44,669
the search results so to ensure that

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,539
together with euro team we decided to to

00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:51,720
perform some upfront actions so all the

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,490
pages which had to change in Drupal 7

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,470
website were merged and unpublished

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:01,909
aurion original website like three or

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:04,950
four months before before the migration

00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:07,500
the content was iteratively translated

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:11,159
transformed into the new version on

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,860
original website so search engine would

00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,260
get acquainted with this information

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,200
much before the release moment and we

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:24,279
won't have this a spike of

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,490
unsatisfied search engine of course

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:31,120
migration of them of the content with

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,820
all the URLs and very interesting method

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,230
we were using for the for the testing of

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,720
the migration we actually were doing

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,620
mirror testing so all the traffic which

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,899
was what which exit which exists for the

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,169
current website was replicated to to the

00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:53,230
to the new website so we got actually a

00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:57,789
real traffic on the new platform which

00:28:53,230 --> 00:29:00,460
wasn't hard mode with this we would

00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:04,690
detect it directly all the 404 errors

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:07,840
all the missing elements so we well

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,429
adding like 301 redirect and so on by

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,549
creating extra content we were

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:14,639
fulfilling through this gap of which you

00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:20,860
usually face while doing migration and

00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:24,190
of course before releasing of the new

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,710
project always think about the platform

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:30,639
so we made the workshops with our

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:33,580
colleagues from a choir to to remember

00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:36,130
and Rida mention the platform to to

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,700
support the Drupal 7 application which

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:43,260
is usually more more resources consuming

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:47,769
applications of course tested against

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:52,299
already existing test cases are with

00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:55,860
blitz and blaze matter release same

00:29:52,299 --> 00:30:01,330
strategy works fine white why change it

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,950
as soon as the project was released so

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,429
that happened in the beginning of this

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:11,440
year we activated Drupal 7 support for

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:14,019
for our our client we had the same

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,049
objectives but this time as far as the

00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:19,990
code was owned by ID acts we didn't have

00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:25,299
any major issues single life so since

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:29,980
beginning of this year as soon as that

00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:32,620
was done we come down a little bit in

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,580
terms of new features and stuff but very

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,940
soon you're

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,800
returned to us asking if we can start

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:43,350
thinking with them about e-commerce

00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:47,170
project in Drupal so it's how the new

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:49,840
project arrived completely new project

00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,870
which is ecommerce in in the application

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,980
so the goal for those projects for this

00:30:52,870 --> 00:31:00,600
project was to to refer to rethink the

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:04,630
e-commerce component of the URL com

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:08,260
ecosystem to improve the architecture to

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:11,830
remove all the outdated and manual

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:16,810
processes and of course be prepare

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:21,660
prepare the the project to to be able to

00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,660
to receive new features in faster way

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:47,770
yeah step zero was how we'll do it and

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:55,730
we made several workshops with URL and

00:31:51,560 --> 00:32:00,170
other partners to see what will be the

00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:05,420
best solution for 444 URL com way that

00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:09,830
the two major options were the

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:14,290
integration with magenta and integration

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,290
of Drupal commerce into the applications

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:20,530
y magenta was not selected in this setup

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:30,470
actually one of the goals for URL that

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:32,480
call was to to decrease the number of we

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,720
can call it useless synchronization

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,320
between different applications there

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,240
were the issue with additional

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:47,720
application to support there was a

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:49,640
question of additional associated costs

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,820
when some business logic should be

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:57,950
replicated from magenta to Drupal to get

00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,680
this work together and of course the

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:04,340
integrated solution drupal commerce

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,830
which can be seen can be easily

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:12,110
installed and then tailored for the sake

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:16,100
of girl that converse was selected next

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:18,410
step for this project was capturing of

00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,470
business requirements for this sake we

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:24,010
involved our colleagues from London

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:29,780
office of Commerce guys who helped us to

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:32,770
collect up to 300 user stories more than

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:36,650
thousand acceptance criteria swere

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:40,850
described and which later will evolve

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:43,910
into detailed testing plan and some

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:46,880
white papers were written to to describe

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,360
the potential technical decisions which

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,679
can be taken we were working on the

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,320
architecture we had two very

00:33:52,679 --> 00:34:02,070
solutions we had 22 different solutions

00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:04,499
one which is on the left was having

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,649
drupal commerce drupal commerce actually

00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:09,000
integrated in each of the applications

00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:11,750
so as far as we're having three

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,980
different websites we are thinking that

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,740
drupal commerce inside of each

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:21,599
application can can work much better

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:25,309
than the the situation when drupal

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,960
commerce will act as a multi-channel

00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:31,559
ecommerce solution for all of those

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,220
websites for the sake of development and

00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,260
planning we we splitted all the

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:41,639
functionalities into the building blocks

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:44,250
which were which will which are owned by

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,240
by a separate project manager who who

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:50,389
isn't who is ensuring the communication

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,669
with third parties with payments

00:34:50,389 --> 00:35:00,359
provider with our fulfillment centers

00:34:53,669 --> 00:35:03,690
with partners of course at the end of

00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:07,260
the of the iteration of this project we

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:10,069
will be working with a quarter to Rida

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,630
mention the platform to it onboard

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:16,849
correctly the e-commerce solution in it

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:20,730
mostly two areas would be the

00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:26,880
improvement in terms of database servers

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:29,460
to perform more transactions and extra

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,770
from servers to support customer service

00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:37,370
and check out processes as for release

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:42,530
still the same it works

00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm moving to the resultant lennon's

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:48,690
area and it's very important we found

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,080
out with the Hugo that it's very

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:55,260
important after certain number of

00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,950
iterations prints we sit together and we

00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,130
we discuss actually what what results we

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:06,960
have after those iterations what

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:10,020
actually lessons we learned after each

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,140
of them and we try to improve all the

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:17,880
time but after the end of the Drupal 7

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:20,010
project we identified the the next

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,440
result which for us are the most

00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:26,100
important ones so from the technical and

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:30,230
business perspective we receive very

00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:35,550
scalable and the stable hosting platform

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:38,670
as far as we were not having any down

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:42,150
times during or since since beginning of

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:48,740
the of the year this the sales are very

00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:52,290
stable the editors of the Ural dot-com

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:54,630
precise that the user experience and

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,960
content management was improved and of

00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:03,600
course ecommerce flows were optimized by

00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:06,930
removing out dating processes and very

00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,830
manual operations would you help me with

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,830
the with other

00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,130
so I wrote on a couple of lessons

00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:21,329
learned we learned a lot during this

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:25,049
this year and two years and what really

00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:29,670
helped was taking the time to find the

00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:32,729
right supplier I think it took me almost

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,880
six months to find the right one because

00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:38,849
when you select one you will stick stuck

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,269
with them for 35 or maybe ten years so

00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:46,829
it's worth taking the time for selecting

00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:49,380
a partner that's breathing almost the

00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:51,269
same as you do so it is they were

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,929
working together working in the same way

00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:58,019
thinking with you etc so it was a good

00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:59,819
learning experience you find word

00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:03,719
flexible is all about functional

00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:06,660
specification I asked my management team

00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:09,059
about flexibility how flexible should

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,069
the system be and I asked the same

00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:14,189
question to our content writers you can

00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:17,609
imagine the ounces weren't exactly the

00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:21,209
same so it cost me a lot of time to say

00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:24,689
okay what really do you want and why do

00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:27,079
you need it because the content writers

00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:30,119
that yeah they were used to add

00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,969
javascript and HTML to it so is it oh

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,939
that that would be very handy but yeah

00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:38,910
our management is I know your your goal

00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:41,609
is to write as many train articles as

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,890
possible so it was real really a

00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:46,769
struggle in the beginning from what do

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:50,999
you really want to have on this new

00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:54,929
system steering committees we every

00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:57,719
month we set together with eurocom

00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:59,459
project managers and a DX project

00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,890
managers and we had a steering committee

00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:04,559
and it was not about technical details

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:07,679
but it was how is our collaboration

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:11,059
working is it's fine or do we see any

00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:14,249
problems do we communicate enough

00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:16,799
because their leader situated in Paris

00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:19,949
and we are in Utah so there's a lot on

00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:22,680
skype on conference calling etc and

00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:25,590
sometimes it's better to sit in one room

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,650
and actually say what you're trying to

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:32,280
say and especially when you're doing

00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:36,660
specifications so once a month it's its

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,160
real worth taking that time and there

00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,770
are a lot of good times too so and

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,710
there's nothing wrong with giving a

00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:47,610
compliment when it's going okay so yeah

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,410
it was really and we try to do it coming

00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,870
Thursday we had another steering

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,020
committee so I'll actually will be at

00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:58,650
our office and we talked about how can

00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,140
we improve communication as actually

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:04,110
mentioned or now five project managers

00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:09,630
at our site so you can imagine how much

00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:12,300
communication there is re act is using

00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,270
at the moment read read mine system it's

00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,790
a tracking and documentation system and

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:20,880
it was really helpful for us because we

00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,920
can we could see what was what the

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,890
developers were doing at that moment if

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,170
they had any questions they could

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,630
directly put him on the on the tracking

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:33,990
system and we could directly answered

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:37,860
them so it was was real a time-saving

00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:40,920
there and now we have during the whole

00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:45,060
project we continued updating

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:50,700
documentation so now we have it all okay

00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:54,330
on a non redmine content migration that

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:59,310
was I think you're all IT kind of guys

00:40:54,330 --> 00:41:03,000
so yeah content is a total different

00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:06,120
aspect of the project for us it's just

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,640
words words words just cut copy and

00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,800
paste them there but for a Content

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,790
writer it's totally different it's it's

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:18,000
their baby it's their creation and same

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:20,160
for for the images so we just copy the

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,860
three images over there oh no no no it's

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:29,790
can be done should be pixel perfect so

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:32,040
it took a while and as mentioned by lack

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:35,220
say we had three weeks prints and for us

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,950
and the other side was also very

00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,500
because we could write this functional

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:43,710
specification we could do the acceptance

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,260
testing we could all start with the

00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:51,410
content migration viral little parts

00:41:46,260 --> 00:42:02,150
already finished so we created our own

00:41:51,410 --> 00:42:02,150
three weeks print that's about it

00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:08,720
and your students do have any questions

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,079
yep please if you prefer

00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,680
yeah actually from technical perspective

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:30,050
there are several tricks that you can do

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,020
with it first of all you can use the

00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:35,720
access logs which is very safe so you

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,080
take the exact slope of your web server

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,490
like for example apache or nginx you

00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:46,550
scan it and you simulate the same the

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:49,310
same traffic the other trick which

00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:53,990
exists and it's not very fair for end

00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:57,770
users because because end users

00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:59,630
experience some extra downloading but

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,750
actually the trick is that you can

00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:05,960
include on each page of your website you

00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:09,520
can include the higher I frame which

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,890
takes the URL of the current page and

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,130
directly cause the new platform the

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:20,150
Hyden platform so user doesn't see the

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:22,970
page loaded but back-end experienced the

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,370
the heat Ole Miss or whatever so

00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:28,600
actually the combination of those two

00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:34,870
tests was we're used to from one side to

00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:39,320
validate the migration to see the 40404

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:41,720
301 errors and on other side to test the

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,850
performance as well to see if we are

00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,130
able the current application is able to

00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,080
cope with the same traffic the same

00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:51,290
level of traffic so at the moment of

00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:55,640
switch the platform won't experience any

00:43:51,290 --> 00:44:00,010
any spikes in the in the in the runtime

00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,010
I hope I have answered your question

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,450
yeah because

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,450
a question about

00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:15,809
so you had an existing setup google 6

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,809
how to identify

00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,840
ultamate

00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,760
use

00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:30,670
i also i'll start with the second

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,940
question so we are using Jenkins web

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,220
server the debt test server continuous

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,910
integration server and we run the tests

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:44,740
written on Ruby and koo kumba so this is

00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:47,410
the question of of the tooling as for

00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,470
the question how we haven't identified

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:53,170
the zone that should be automated so

00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,690
that two to two groups of

00:44:53,170 --> 00:45:03,070
functionalities first group is the group

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:05,500
of critical zones and critical paths so

00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,630
which should be and the critical

00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,110
features we should be validated each

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,850
time the code is delivered so this is a

00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,400
part for continuous integration so

00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,950
usually you can easily identify those

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,720
zones for e-commerce platform so this is

00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:24,160
shopping cart buy it now buttons

00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:29,980
availability of the products this place

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:34,410
or what is ecommerce funeral process on

00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:37,870
other side when you want to verify the

00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:40,690
availability of several critical

00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:44,380
contents of the side you usually you can

00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:49,000
ask the owners of the content owners of

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:51,880
them of the web application to help you

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,860
to identify the first of all the

00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,860
critical information that should be

00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,530
tested why why we were testing

00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:03,250
availability of Compton because

00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:07,150
initially there while while working with

00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:09,040
another provider the quality was not so

00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,800
good so pages we're disappearing from

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:18,010
time to time and if it's not a secret

00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:23,680
one person in URL com had to go on daily

00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:27,280
basis and check availability of 1 to 20

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:32,050
pages I would say that was automated for

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,550
example and of course there are some

00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:38,900
cooling which allows you to see

00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:41,570
the fastest actually user flow to the

00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:45,430
funeral so you usually test the areas

00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:45,430
which help you to convert

00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:59,390
responsive was that delivered

00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:02,079
consider

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,079
experience

00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,010
was that

00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:18,269
yeah we we did a project before this

00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:20,999
project for doing a new redesign and we

00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:24,589
did not take that into account so is

00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:31,679
that ok we are not doing that besides

00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:35,609
the real our bosses are not cheap so it

00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,889
is a real lot of money and so for a

00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:41,549
little mobile phone you're you're not

00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:43,829
using our website is our experience and

00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:47,849
we we measured that and it's less than

00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:50,759
one percent so so but we're taking it

00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:52,499
into account now but yeah it's a bit of

00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:55,349
ways of money of course because you have

00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:58,049
to start all over again but we're not

00:47:55,349 --> 00:48:01,139
sure what to do with mobile I can't

00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:03,959
imagine that we use mobile during your

00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:06,089
your trip in Europe so then but then you

00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:08,429
don't need our website then you need our

00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:11,609
tooling that helps you traveling through

00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:13,380
your so we are not quite there which

00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:20,809
direction we have to go so there was

00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,809
that's fun yeah yes

00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:43,430
for us for us it was because it was from

00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:47,090
the past we saw the current hosting and

00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:49,520
Drupal expert we're doing two times not

00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:52,130
a good job which is 50 50 s and we said

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:56,510
okay let's go for a real Drupal expert

00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:58,910
team and another for the hosting so

00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:02,210
that's more about how we saw at that

00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:10,580
time but from the technical perspective

00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:14,240
I would say that that if you ain't an

00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:18,230
expert in something you should stay in

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:22,820
this area and do the maximum you can in

00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:24,560
this area it's one of the that one of

00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,680
the things that we learn actually energy

00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,690
acts we had so many opportunities to

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,150
expand into different technologies but

00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:37,370
we focus on Drupal and it's what our

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:39,530
colleagues from a choir is doing in the

00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:42,610
holding area i would say because they

00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:45,440
have some extra departments were working

00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:47,990
the idea behind splitting those things

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:53,570
is to map to separate the zones of

00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:55,760
responsibility where one-eyed jacks in

00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:59,750
this setup and drupal provider in

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:04,130
general thinks about application itself

00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:07,250
it might go a little bit further and to

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,560
check the configurations and stuff but

00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:13,100
the hosting is completely different

00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:16,370
thing and you have to do to to hire the

00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:20,000
experts of completely different profile

00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:24,680
who knows how to to identify the zones

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,290
you have to to tune the applications and

00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:31,250
it's very two different areas and

00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:34,070
domains of expertise so by separating

00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:37,270
and doing things correctly in each of

00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,990
the zones we ensure the quality which

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:44,450
which

00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:47,020
we see i would say for this project any

00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,020
other questions

00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,180
um

00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:21,370
you are okay I was actually at the

00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:24,100
current stage in Drupal 7 project as I

00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:27,010
called it we had to integrate with a

00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:30,910
standalone ecommerce solution which is

00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:35,170
called inter shop where drupal was

00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:38,020
acting as a veteran website which was

00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,700
integrated as well the shopping and

00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:43,920
dynamic elements for the product

00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:47,950
management and of course my account zone

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,860
where all the e-commerce logic cook

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:53,020
boning sheep being fulfillment and other

00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:57,310
stuff was managed in the standalone

00:51:53,020 --> 00:52:00,190
ecommerce platform today when URL that

00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:02,470
cone would like to minimize the number

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:05,550
of applications and in the in the

00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:09,130
ecosystem where drupal actually can act

00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:14,230
both as a content management system and

00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:17,380
as e-commerce platform I think it's kind

00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,900
of logical move and of course there were

00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:23,580
plenty of other reasons why I URL that

00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:27,640
Congress decided to move and to go

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:30,460
ecommerce quadruple so yeah right now

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,180
we're running this project and it's the

00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,770
first Sprint's of the development of

00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:37,450
this project and which will be released

00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,720
in the beginning of next year we're

00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:44,620
actually ecommerce will be migrated from

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:53,610
the second stand-alone application into

00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:53,610
the drupal yeah right

00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,820
slides

00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,309
yep

00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:12,730
we need to see actually the weather if

00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:16,960
we can share them but those white papers

00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:20,250
are about the best practices how you can

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,650
make for example white labeling how

00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:27,610
architecture can be selected for these

00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:30,940
all that sake I don't know we need to

00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:33,550
see if if we can you can take my

00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,530
business card and send me an email to

00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:37,480
check this out I cannot answer it right

00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:39,490
now but we can discuss it with with the

00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,040
year old at come at the current stage

00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:43,960
which internal documentation are which

00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:49,330
was delivered by commerce guys and I

00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:52,650
Jack's for your elders come any

00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,650
questions yeah

00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:07,290
I I felt what we were calculating it it

00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:09,300
was yeah I don't know but but in average

00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:13,380
it's those projects of this type is

00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:18,270
around 15,000 hours of all the profiles

00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:21,690
so it's actually for the last year we

00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:24,570
had a team of three to four I never told

00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:27,740
I I didn't make a slide for the for the

00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:31,680
team I will tell you so we had a team of

00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:33,870
development team of three to four

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,690
persons it was dependent on the on the

00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:39,630
on the Lord actually are because some of

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:42,240
the springs were taking more features

00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:46,550
into it some of them were taking less so

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:49,170
the team was there we had the QA team of

00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:53,160
two to three person depending on the

00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:56,010
Lord so this is many or QA teams we had

00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:59,340
a one person who was ensuring the

00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:02,940
automated testing system administrator

00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:06,450
we had to project managers on our side

00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:10,130
and this year it will be three project

00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:14,580
managers team of five persons of

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:17,400
developers and yeah ecommerce project is

00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:19,650
very short-term project we if I don't

00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,150
know if you noticed but we play we are

00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,150
planning to deliver it in five months

00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:34,380
yeah so I would say it's around 15,000

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,180
hours total and in general when I have

00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,590
presented the project what we are doing

00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:43,380
it's the project of averaged 10 to 20 to

00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:46,490
25,000 hours it's the project of one and

00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,490
more year yes

00:55:48,400 --> 00:56:02,869
any other questions okay thank you very

00:55:55,670 --> 00:56:08,440
much good life just to show you one

00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:12,820
thing I d axis running Drupal 8 hoc

00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:17,000
contest the goal of this contest is to

00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:20,330
try to hug Drupal 8 installation so you

00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,910
can find it by this address you can go

00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:26,060
there there's Drupal on it it's a

00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:28,790
separate virtual machine which has or

00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:32,530
has not some security updates installed

00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:36,619
or deployed each day we are delivering

00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:39,020
extra well we are simplifying your job

00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:42,230
we're delivering extra features for you

00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:45,680
so last time we have activated I think

00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:53,020
the registration without without

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:53,020
confirmation and log in without without

00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:03,349
without our control actually you can try

00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:07,760
to brute-force the thing if you want so

00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:12,020
the one who who will hack Drupal 8 will

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,780
gain the parrot drone and you can go and

00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:19,310
see it it's a huge flying machine so i

00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:22,730
think you should be motivated so please
