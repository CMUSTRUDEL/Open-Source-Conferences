Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Drupal 8: Undercover Initiatives
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: pcambra
Drupal 8 core initiatives introduced a new methodology for Drupal core development, they've helped to focus contributions and efforts very effectively towards the main objectives of the release. All these initiatives, "Views in core", "Multilingual", "Configuration management", "Web services", "Blocks & layouts" and "Mobile" have accomplished really important milestones, key for an innovative and powerful Drupal 8 version.

However, there's a number of other efforts behind the scenes that have brought major changes to Drupal 8.
This session will cover the most important changes that are not necessarily covered by any initiative but the community has made possible. Some of these changes include the way that menus work, field and entity api changes, actions, modules that have made it into core, features removed, etc.

Join me in this talk to take a look to the most relevant changes coming from these often overlooked initiatives that will change the way we face projects in Drupal 8.

This session is intended to site builders and coders willing to know what's going on under the hood of Drupal 8 and get a better understanding on all the changes that are coming.

welcome to the delight in undercover

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:12,950
initiative session this is a talk about

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:17,789
how Drupal 8 has changed in the past few

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,430
years now besides all the official

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,330
initiatives you've heard of so my aim is

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,000
to maybe you may see something that you

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,449
know already but maybe something you

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,440
don't so my goal is to put light and all

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,870
those initiatives that or all those

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,969
changes that haven't been so publicized

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,820
besides the official initiatives so

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,510
before we start I have a couple of

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,010
disclaimers the first one is that what

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,739
you see here while you're going to see

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:58,410
here may not may be true is not I'm a

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,840
liar or anything is that I mean I've

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,969
been running this session for a year or

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,850
so now and i was looking to the initial

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:11,040
set of slides and i probably changed all

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,729
those twice or three times so the things

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,150
that I'm presenting our there but is not

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:22,580
guaranteed there may be changes or some

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,580
things may may not happen eventually

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,450
second is that I'm showing code so if

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,280
you don't see it properly from the back

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,280
I mean it's a pretty small room I guess

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,880
I guess you will but if you don't see

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,520
those lights are either embedded Lee it

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,950
/ the eight undercover so if you want to

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,840
check those go ahead so about me I work

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,009
in a company called in bruh we're based

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,350
in Barcelona and London inp Canberra all

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,540
over and I happen to be the truck sure

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,170
of the quadrant development a track for

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,090
for this cone on the new small PHP one

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,430
so if you have any feedback out with

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,649
those I mean this is a random list but

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,899
you have any feedback of those just find

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,990
me in i'll be happy to to answer any

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,050
comments

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,580
so let's get started first of all I want

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,800
to talk about what the Drupal 8

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:25,010
initiatives are and how they are

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:29,720
relevant I have two scripts here that's

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,430
great yeah so this is a new way to

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,010
develop the polite we didn't have that

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,400
interval seven so it sets a very

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,680
specific goal of very specific objective

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,640
for the for the leaders of those

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,390
initiatives that are appointed and it

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,090
improves the focus of the volunteers

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,040
working on them on those initiatives so

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,640
whereas you may not have a clear idea

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,010
what to work on they do and you can look

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,050
up and ask them what their goals are and

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,120
they have the authority to make

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:07,940
decisions so these if you're not

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,770
familiar with the initiative DRDs hard

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,270
initiatives like we have the web

00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:17,000
services one the abusing core the cmi

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,810
the mobile one so these are the official

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,380
one this these guys had a goal and move

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:33,190
Drupal 8 22 that goal but a ton of

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:37,550
things happen outside these initiatives

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,790
so I see drupal 8 like you get a new car

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,180
you open the hood and then you get a big

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,489
snake there you probably didn't know

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,520
about it but you probably want to do

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:55,160
something unless you'd really like mix

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:58,580
next so this is like the graphic vision

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,440
of this of this talk there are really

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,459
big things changing and you should be a

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,560
work now I'm starting with a couple of

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:10,040
things that you probably heard Tom's

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:15,019
about it first one is that we have a new

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:19,160
with week in Cork didn't tell you about

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:22,780
this one right yeah ok so we've been

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,420
complaining for no six years in Drupal

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,360
that we don't have

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:30,090
wysiwyg editor want to install that's

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,900
how like the main conversation that you

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,020
used here and as soon as it happened

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,910
well the first thing we did is complain

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,790
because it maybe it was too much which

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,480
we got all wrong another thing that

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,190
happened was twix if you haven't heard

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,810
about it there's a great session about

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,350
it I don't know where it when it is well

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,890
they just look into it so we had these

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,440
in Drupal 7 this is how we render block

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:03,480
with PHP template right so there's a lot

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,320
of PHP here and there and then print no

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,260
this is not really safe for handing over

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,780
and you probably how many of you have to

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,280
consider yourself developers ok well

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:21,990
there's is there anything more in the

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,630
room well maybe this is not really safe

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,020
to handle someone that implements the

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,150
design there's a lot of security issues

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,120
and things like that this is the same

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,210
file with tweek you know you have a nice

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,130
output here there is no PHP everything

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,130
is sanitized so it is a great addition

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:55,290
there is a new how to load or you have

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:59,850
probably heard about the PHR thing and

00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:02,640
before you ask stands for proposal for a

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,850
standard request I probably forget this

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,120
after the dollar store and this is not a

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,250
code thing is just a standard so it

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,360
marks how the files should be organized

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,940
so Drupal 8 started with PSR 0 which

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,860
means that you put the right file in the

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,830
right directory and it will just load it

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:30,030
will auto load for you so that means no

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:35,560
more requires or model includes or files

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:38,020
array or hook menus with path and

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,389
I'll and everything you don't need that

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:44,530
because you put the file in the right

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:50,010
place and it will just load and PS are

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,010
for simplifies the folder structure and

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:59,110
this is great for our really important

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,320
reason that when you download a model or

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,260
when you get a piece of code if you want

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,360
to know where the menu our menus are

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,750
implemented or the forms or where the

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,380
entity definitions are with these you

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,389
just know you just go to the folder that

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,790
should have them and all the models

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,870
should be implementing these otherwise I

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,660
will consider that broken I mean I

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,570
suppose us getting hook menu that

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,389
defines the admin page in an unmeaning

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,360
file or just in the model or just in a

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,820
folder called admin or just you know so

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:42,940
you have a very very good structure and

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,520
you know what to SPECT there are some

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,360
things that have been gone from Drupal 8

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:55,539
core so no don't bother looking for them

00:07:49,360 --> 00:08:02,050
them there so it's been core is smaller

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:05,229
in a way one thing is gone and I'm very

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:10,260
happy about it you should too is a pitch

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:15,810
p filter is gone I feel safer already I

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,810
mean if you get handed I mean a project

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:23,580
you had get handed a project the PHP

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,539
filter could be enable anywhere waiting

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,630
just to hand you because you know it's

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,820
the Civil rasta and it has a security

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,669
and performance issues so if you put a

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,050
PHP filter PHP code with peach people

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:45,250
during a node that invalidates cash so

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:48,070
that's not very good and it solves a

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,580
very specific use case in the past but I

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,800
don't think

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,190
we have that anymore so it was useful in

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,540
the past but you know but if you're

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,030
willing to take the risk that you don't

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,570
honestly there are some countries model

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:10,540
that enabled a PHP filter for those but

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:12,580
like risky sport oh you have when you

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,830
get this lies you have like links with

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:20,230
the history there and how the things

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:23,590
happen may be useful so these are gone

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,770
as well so we don't have the profile

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,860
model we don't have to look anymore we

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,780
don't have trigger because honestly how

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,820
many of you did actually use the trigger

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:41,170
mode of core okay one there was a shy

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:45,940
hand in the back I didn't die sure is

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:50,980
gone open ID you know how hard is put a

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:54,870
blink nowadays in HTML overlay is gone

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,570
Paul is gone and no gar belong anymore

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:03,520
now maybe be a sad panda thing but we

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,560
have bartok now and all of these are is

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,810
not that they just wipe out the code is

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,330
there all of them are in a country

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:16,330
mobile now yes they are not in Drupal

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:20,290
core okay so this is a quote from the

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,930
issue queue says disabled models are

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,720
broken beyond repair I'm just being

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,880
literal that's what it says and this is

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,340
something that I mean a very graphical

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,980
images came to my mind when I read this

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,450
and we want to share it with you Stace

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,790
so you now have something that was great

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,340
at the beginning then got a little less

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,760
great and then over time then someone

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,830
came and trying to fix it I was not

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,790
really possible you know it's not that

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,900
it was a matter of skills it was really

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:59,680
really impossible to do so no more model

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,830
disabled for us and this is a very

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,590
controversial part of lying person

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,760
normally because people say well I used

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,070
model disabled I think is useful I'm not

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,980
reflecting my opinions I'm just doing

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:20,240
that it has happened so basically in a

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:25,080
nutshell disabled model means disabling

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:29,780
how it behaves with other things say the

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:34,020
user say other models say the database

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,060
so say you disable a model and you'll

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,360
leave it like like that for a while and

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,220
your side the bulbs when you go to

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,280
enable that model again you may have a

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,710
data integrity risk because all that

00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,360
data go to stale in a table for a while

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:53,940
and then you don't really know if that's

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:57,470
going to work in Drupal 506 you know

00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,630
when building website seemed simpler

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,610
this work very well but in Drupal 7 we

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:08,270
already started to notice that this

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:13,640
wasn't a very good future plan so

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:17,250
everything that looked like a disabled

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:21,150
action for models is gone so now a model

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:25,170
is either install or uninstall so if you

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,930
have a model and you enable it install

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,610
it for the first time for getting rid of

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:36,060
that you need to actually completely

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:39,660
uninstall it and thanks to the slide we

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,000
say we saw before without PSR for there

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,520
is a new autoloader so if a model if

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
installed is its installed at the

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,410
autoloader will look for the files and

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,240
we load the files of the dead model that

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,270
makes disabling it really really

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:59,130
difficult because it will be a very big

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:03,000
overhead on the autoloader and they

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,740
might be a model for this it's just I

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,260
mean that they just reserved the

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,090
namespace and let's see if someone

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,290
figures out how to do it but not in car

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,400
normally the use case you have for

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,530
disabled model is

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,960
like I'm doing a migration and I want to

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:33,720
just disable this thing to see the rest

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:35,580
are working right so yeah yeah yeah I

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,640
said a book tool that's the other use

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:42,770
case so you have her narrow and then you

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:46,110
have to do you use like the very very

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,090
deterministic approach of being like

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,470
removing things and then see if it's

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:57,090
working I would say that you need a real

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,780
debugging tool like I mean which one is

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,640
failing and you can put like a nice and

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,270
as break point and then they work the

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,340
whole thing you won't be able to do this

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,760
in Tripoli name you won't be able to

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:16,470
disable mobile and just see if the site

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,980
gets fixed as I said and this happen is

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,980
not mine

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:34,820
we'll see don't kill the messenger so

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,150
another thing that is gone and this may

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,250
be surprising this has happened

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,960
previously I mean like it's being a

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,210
progress for the last few months and

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,810
we've been happening for a while is that

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:52,310
we don't have a menu model anymore but

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:55,550
wait before running away panic yeah I'm

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,430
just run get away I mean we have a new

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,770
menu safestone it's not just a model we

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,290
have a new menu system and this menu

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,180
system starts for the for the roads so

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,220
we have the roles there and you define

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,090
like the starting point like the URL or

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,550
the URI and you have a subsystem for

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,340
every other menu components and we'll

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,100
see this in a little bit of mod tail but

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,740
the things that we have in in Drupal and

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,560
we call it a menu are like the menu

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,380
items like normal menu item that is in a

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,390
hierarchy we have actions I mean we have

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,130
tabs we have actions and we have

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,490
contextual links that's it like the

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:37,160
typology of things we have and actions

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,340
if someone because I have to look this

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,430
up to see what the action goes like the

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:47,330
glass create new node type that's not

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:49,640
you know and and then we have the custom

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:53,990
eight items that those that you just

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:56,780
create by interface and many you is gone

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,260
so most of the things are basically part

00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,810
of the curve libraries but there are two

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:07,840
new models so for each one we kill we

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:12,230
get to New we have many new UI that

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,600
takes care of the of the interfaces like

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,390
the you know like if you disable views

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,230
you eyes you can't create a view plus

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:25,070
what it is and menu link content that

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,410
takes care of the customers are so if

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:31,910
you enable that the user will be able to

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:38,250
create new menus new menu links inside

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:41,580
through the internet and this is what

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,209
the menu is in Drupal 7 as for today I'm

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:49,890
just trying to reason why this happen

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:52,980
and here you see well we choose your

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:57,540
number of things a cook menu that we all

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,190
love and declare like a lot of things so

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,050
if you declare our menu you are actually

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:06,750
creating a route you're actually

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:12,179
creating a page but you're also adding a

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:17,670
call back with a wild card and access

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:21,660
and where it is and white type what type

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:24,630
it is so I mean hook many is clearly

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,740
doing too much away and that is that is

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:33,809
a big problem so that's why the menus

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:40,260
got replaced by these new collection of

00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:43,890
of tools and this works as this so we

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,200
have the root first so unifirst need to

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,520
create the entrance point like the URL

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:54,600
so we have a routing system that you

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,200
define in general files will will seem a

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,040
lot of general stuff in this

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,040
presentation journal it's a yet another

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:12,150
markup language so self defines very

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:16,130
well it's like Jason but not Jason so we

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:18,990
have roots that map basically the path

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:22,790
with a controller and this controller

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:25,500
can be a method in a class can be

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:29,400
liberation leveraging the entity form

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,970
system so if you want an edit form for

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,280
an entity you need this and that's it

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,320
you have a lots of examples you'll see

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,610
if you go to diss track you'll see a lot

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,640
of these examples these these days but

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:47,150
it also defines permission and access

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,850
to that road and you can even put

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:54,590
regular expressions to say this argument

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:57,300
here is only a string or it can only be

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,880
decimal or any other crazy regular

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,860
expression you can come up so this is

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,050
like the entrance point this is just

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,410
defining the route I like the path of

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,510
the paint which actually if you think

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,820
about it doesn't have anything to do

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,970
with the actual menu the navigation menu

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:19,470
of the user so if you actually want that

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:27,300
menu as well you need to define it in

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:30,630
another jungle file which are the note I

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,450
mean denote the model name the links

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,510
port because we need something and then

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,030
the type of the menu so you have task

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,570
with our action we have item we have

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,020
many of them and this is actually what

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:49,770
creates the menu that the user sees the

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:53,250
navigation thing and custom menu links

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,400
you can have it as a normal content

00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,270
entity so when user creates a menu is

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,330
actually a new entity like a note or a

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:06,930
taxonomy term or the same user shares

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:11,880
shares the same the same thing so the

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:13,860
thing that you need is the root name so

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,670
I don't know how many times you've

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:21,660
changed an application in in hot mode

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,790
when the the URLs change so suddenly the

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,460
user wants a new URL for something

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,890
that's pretty common has happened to me

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,950
last week and you have to basically

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,550
search and replace every word you've use

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,890
it right so with this system with the

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,590
new routing system there you have a

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,720
machine name for the road and just one

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:49,230
place for defining the URL which is

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:52,130
great yeah contextual action doesn't

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,130
menu links that's it

00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:01,850
okay so as I said for every model we

00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:05,299
killed in Drupal 8 2 extra at least up

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:08,000
here so actually Drupal 8 I mean that

00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:11,409
before was a plain life it's not drunk

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,640
at all it's bigger than ever and

00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,529
something you could say that I mean all

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,909
the hooks or many of the hooks are gone

00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:25,429
now and with replace the hooks by upturn

00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:29,090
of files object object style and that's

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:34,309
probably good long-term it's been a

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:37,120
painful process but one great thing we

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:41,450
have in coron jubilate is my great and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,220
there are sprints right now all this

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,230
week in my grades urine if you're

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,120
interested in this that's a great place

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:55,159
to learn and so you know they upgrade

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:59,000
the update PHP URL you have in Drupal 7

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,070
6 5 and probably earlier than that that

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,929
will be racing migrated to my gram a

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:09,529
great as in the country of my great

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:12,919
model because it really I mean how many

00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:18,890
of you have done a client work using the

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:24,470
update PHP okay you risk your hands I

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:25,789
mean it wasn't really working honestly I

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,429
mean if you as soon as you have

00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:31,190
something a little more complicated like

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,159
that than the normal use case like the

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:37,669
expected use case you probably just

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,520
already did my Great War flow right you

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:47,270
just build a new site import all the

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:49,789
content and then go even for from for

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,350
Drupal to Drupal and actually dirty the

00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,799
first thing one of the first things that

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:58,309
got into core with the my grade and

00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:02,750
model was the migrated from Drupal 6 to

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:04,240
Drupal 8 so there are tools to migrate a

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,750
Drupal 6 to Drupal

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,750
eight more or less I mean you know

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:14,260
previous statuses everything else in

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:17,440
court right now and my great for Drupal

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,440
8 i will show you some code now uses a

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,650
best practice like a mini score now so

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,440
it's the quality of the code is a core

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,950
standard and it's testable and it

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,730
actually has tests so you can guarantee

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:37,179
that something is working or not and

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:41,309
that's a very a very powerful tool so

00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:41,309
you can you could potentially pass

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,970
sample of your data to your migration

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:57,120
tools and see if it's working or not

00:23:47,970 --> 00:24:01,690
doing the test this is how you define a

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:05,380
migration these days in Drupal core as I

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,559
said this may change slightly or not in

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:12,790
the future so you have a general file

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:15,910
that's a surprise and you have the name

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:20,530
of the model migration and this is the

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:23,860
machine name of it this migrate user

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:26,800
roles from Drupal 6 to the power 8

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,830
because the other big thing with my

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,390
grade in Drupal 8 is that you can

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:36,340
actually migrate also configuration so

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,130
you can integrate both content like

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:45,730
notes and configuration like a user role

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:48,600
or our taxonomy characteristics or

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,559
anything anything that is actually

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,570
configuration variables all the

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,910
variables have an app it's already so

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,460
you can migrate your variables the same

00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,940
way you migrate your content and that is

00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,940
a good thing

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:13,260
so and did I find a plug in line you

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:16,470
will go to that in and you define a

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:21,450
serial of series of transformation so

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:24,930
you have a plug-in system to your

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:27,540
sources meaning you're getting from a

00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:32,040
database you're getting for an XML how's

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:36,210
your XML doing I mean is it this VR is

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,710
in an excel file you can have a plug-in

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:43,920
for that you have an object that takes

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:47,700
care of that then you have processors so

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,910
this thing here converts whatever string

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,500
you have to a machine name to make sure

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,690
that the use of roles you are important

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,540
are you are really a machine name and

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,480
these take curves that the entity name

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:03,090
is not duplicated so you could add

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,230
processors to your migration that

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:09,810
transform your data over game over the

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:12,540
process you doing and at the end

00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:16,080
somewhere sorry I'm looking there you

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,560
look here you have destination and

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,510
that's another plug-in so you can have

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,700
destination that is an entity that is a

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:31,320
variable that is and you can overwrite

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:33,090
that and all of these are pluggable so

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,310
you can actually extend them you can

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,400
actually provide your own you can you

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:41,850
can modify them and this is the example

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,070
of the machine name of this is a process

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,290
plugin for my great this is not a my

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,140
great talk is just to get you like in

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,390
the in the right in the right path but

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,870
when you do a process what you have is a

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:57,960
transformative it gets something an

00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:00,320
output something else and this is

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,770
generating a machine name so it gets the

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:09,260
transliteration value it transformed

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:12,999
lower case it does a break replace a

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:15,189
regular expression to just have the

00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:19,599
underscore to have machine name and then

00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:22,209
just return them a value that's it so

00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:27,479
you have another transformation you can

00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:31,329
just go in this exact same reaction so

00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:36,429
wait plugins was that because I've said

00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:38,709
it a lot and a plugging is just piece of

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:40,809
code with a specific purpose you can say

00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:46,839
like a that's a very broad definition

00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:50,099
and Drupal 8 has plugins everywhere the

00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:53,829
block system plug-in system the

00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:58,199
migration is a blogging system abuse has

00:27:53,829 --> 00:28:00,909
a incredibly lot of plugins there so and

00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:03,849
this is just a weight of a fancy way to

00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:09,279
say all your code that was in model

00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:14,349
files should be that's more or less data

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:16,509
and if you want to know more I'm going

00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,939
to just because I chick like that I'm

00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:21,099
just recommending you systems there is a

00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:23,319
session in the plugin system if you want

00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:28,739
to know more time to be played with Joe

00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,739
syndra highly recommended Thursday

00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:39,609
speaking of plugins the action system is

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:41,649
a plug-in base as well so as I say how

00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,869
many people did actually use the trigger

00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:47,259
an action action models in Drupal 7 I

00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:51,669
mean you had rules at some point so it

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:53,619
wasn't really really powerful so actions

00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:55,869
are now an outdated plugins and this is

00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:57,459
one of the other Peggy point of this

00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:03,629
presentation you will see that in a

00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:07,709
minute and we have configured actions

00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:10,479
that doesn't require a user input and

00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:11,919
those are configuration entities and

00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:14,199
we'll talk about that in a minute as

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,229
well so that your model will be just the

00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:21,309
interface I'm actually not sure if the

00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:24,669
action movie section you I know that

00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,169
means we have have simplified we use

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:29,289
bulk operation

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:31,989
in car which means that all your

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:35,470
listings in the admin interface will

00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:37,239
become views so if you want to provide

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,999
the user with an extra field in your

00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:42,970
node listing you can you don't have to

00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:45,609
do anything really really complicated to

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:49,749
happen and that is great right it's not

00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:52,179
good in this guy as you have the actions

00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:57,429
API you have a conditions API as well

00:29:52,179 --> 00:30:01,960
like matching and the rules countries

00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:05,679
model will probably be based on these so

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:09,549
this is an example of a plug-in from the

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:13,899
action this is how action plugin so you

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:20,049
have a configuration and you have the

00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:22,269
form so for example to provide a user

00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,700
with a new role that's a very classic

00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:27,159
triple action yeah you have a user I

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,029
want to give it giving a role so I need

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:34,179
the UI for that so the role you're

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:36,970
giving him will be exposing a form here

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:42,309
and then you have a normal validating

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:46,809
subject function but if you want to

00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:49,269
provide a pre-configured action like

00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,460
with your installation that the user

00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:56,649
doesn't need to actually select anything

00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:00,940
it's just an action but when when this

00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:02,590
action runs I just create this role for

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,649
the user I just assigned this role to

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:09,249
the user no selection or anything this

00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:10,720
is a configurator a config entity have

00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:18,419
you heard before about configuration

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:22,960
entities no no why yeah what

00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:25,749
configuration entities you know we have

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,820
content entities there are like no sex

00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:30,549
anonymous users those are filled of all

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,460
those are they useful entities we are

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:35,110
just to work with we have configuration

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,780
entities now in Drupal

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,270
which share the API with the content

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,380
entities so you can just create them or

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:48,860
delete them we'll go back to that and

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:51,020
used it uses a different storage in the

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,840
active conflict what is called instead

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,430
of being in tables in the database well

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,910
actually they are in tables and others

00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:02,480
but instead of being a normal table it

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:04,370
will be a key value pair normal and you

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,440
can create these configuration entities

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:10,040
just to put in just by putting a right

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:14,720
jamel file in the right place so you

00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,310
don't need to do PHP code to do that and

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,820
you can move them around between

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:24,980
environments very easily and not feel

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,350
double and you if you have the

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,170
temptation of having a configuration

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:32,810
entity to add a field to a configuration

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,240
entity it's probably not a configuration

00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:40,640
entity is not for that so let's look at

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,460
this of some disassembled again this is

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,610
a configure action and we created just

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,130
with entity create we don't need any

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:52,790
other API we create the configuration

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:55,610
entities by call if we need it with this

00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:59,380
with the same API otherwise you just

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:05,570
provide the Jama file and good to go

00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:10,370
yeah so I have a very important point

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:12,470
here that is while all these other

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,390
initiatives were none and these were

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,410
these are great don't misunderstand me

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,830
but a huge thing has happened in the

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:25,370
back like the back of the room nobody

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:28,100
was watching the whole field system and

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:32,740
the whole entity system is changed

00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:36,640
actually it's been changed twice

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,970
and we are all talking about symphony

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,160
and everything related this week but at

00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,980
the sea of see a message for content and

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,190
that's where the content is that's the

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:53,080
really important part and a lot of

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,540
things have happened and one of the big

00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,200
things that has happened besides having

00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:01,390
them date field from the moment you

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,950
install because you know you use dates

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:08,020
right email link fields there are

00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:11,590
simplified sport simplified ports of

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:15,520
these of these models so when you

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:18,010
install the telephone field do you don't

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,290
get all the countries in the world in a

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,780
drop-down okay you just get a plain text

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,990
field so it's a simplified birth but the

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,879
great thing is the entity reference so

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,470
there is no more discussion about how

00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,320
you relate entities between each other

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:35,980
in Drupal 8 you use entity reference

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,159
it's flexible is extendable is plugging

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,500
base again so if you want to go nuts

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,040
with it you can just provide plugin for

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:51,609
it and you don't need to do any any any

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:53,679
hacking and this is this one is great so

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:56,080
I don't know if you have the necessity

00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,580
of having a comment and something that

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:05,140
wasn't a node yeah sounds familiar to

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,660
some okay i know i did comment is now a

00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,869
field so you can add comments to

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:16,410
anything meaning that you can have

00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:18,910
comments to comment you know forums and

00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,369
you can have several comment fields for

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:24,160
every every entity type and you can

00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,020
reuse existing fields so everything that

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,000
is good about fields you have it in

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,330
comments which is which is a great thing

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,970
and there will be if there is not

00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,800
already a migration path for a braid in

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:40,050
your old comments to the new system

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,920
which is a good thing to have

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:47,400
this is a slide I totally stole from the

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,380
field ap I said this is where Phil API

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:56,370
meets the configuration management

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:57,660
management initiative so all the how

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:04,290
many of you have a struggle with

00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:07,680
features at some point you know at the

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:10,830
field config thing and the bundle

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,080
settings right the Vandals event is one

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:18,440
of my name in their nightmares every

00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:23,580
night those are gone so fields under

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,520
definitions are general files there are

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:30,960
configuration entities so you can deploy

00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,090
them in environment that's good they are

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,820
they supposed to be human readable I

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:39,630
mean I mean is a jungle file is a text

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,930
file so it's better than a bunch of PHP

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:47,940
now feature file and can be deployed as

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:51,740
I said and in Drupal 7 when you delete a

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:55,770
field you got a table called feel

00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:59,610
deleted and a number it's familiar with

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:01,290
that and when you try to create a field

00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,900
that it was named the same way that the

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,210
old what you couldn't all you could all

00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,050
you could hope for is to run crown and

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:12,630
finger cross it will they will go away

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:17,160
which sometimes didn't happen now the

00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:21,740
delete fields are kept in a state in

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:25,380
state variables on the state storage

00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:30,330
state is a new storage for storing key

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:33,330
value pairs interpolate so they are not

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,520
deployed so it's like you will store

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,040
there the last time the crown was run

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,750
and that's not something that you are

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,760
interested in moving in between

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,500
environments so the delete fields are

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,650
going to be stored there and you will be

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,650
good to go that's a great addition and

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:58,290
what we use to call fields is now called

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,770
field storage this means named many

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:04,860
times over the past month and you define

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:08,100
a field like this I mean you normally

00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,190
wouldn't create this yourself you'll

00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,650
probably create the field by interfacing

00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,770
then export these to a channel 5 that

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:20,220
would be like the normal workflow and

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:25,530
you have the entity type and you have a

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:29,820
lot of lot of things here and the name

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:33,290
of their of the Jamel file to put in

00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,000
your model will be like a field storage

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,150
entity type because the fields are born

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,930
to an entity type and the name of the

00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:48,420
field and what we used to call instance

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:51,210
is now called field and you will end up

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:55,080
with something like field field juicer

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:58,110
juicer juicer picture okay so is this

00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,180
the entity type this is a field this is

00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,310
the field entity type this is the entity

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,200
type this is the bundle and this is the

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:09,930
number num name of the field okay so

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,900
don't put too many users and then you

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,760
relate them with our with a bundle with

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:22,130
orange attire and you can have

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:22,130
dependencies there but just yesterday

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:33,210
okay maybe maybe it was two days ago ya

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:37,410
feel name is not filming anymore his

00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:43,800
name ok so this things changed a lot

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:46,500
still and there's a Drupal 8 cm I

00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,600
session with Matt Cheney Matt Cheney and

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,340
Dave Strauss on Wednesday you want to

00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,320
know more about cmi because that's a

00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:59,120
little out of scope and I think this is

00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,880
like I've Ivan I've changed it 13 times

00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,190
now I'm not exactly so if you want to

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,050
create a field there are configuration

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,600
entities so you can use entity great for

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,050
that so you can enter to create a field

00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:16,560
storage company or a note with this name

00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:21,150
which is tied and then you can create

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,560
the field config is the instance so you

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,990
can create the instance for this

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,720
actually this should be named sorry

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,810
about that and this time and by the way

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,850
that's how you would create a field you

00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,650
can put tones of setting sir but that's

00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:38,130
the basic thing to create a field in

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,260
Drupal 8 by PHP you can put the Jamel

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:44,070
file and it will and import the

00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,620
configuration instead and you can just

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,540
change things like this you can change

00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,870
the few countries change the cardinality

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:55,080
and then call save like it as if it were

00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:57,390
another entity which it is and then you

00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,740
have a limited set of hooks that have

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:04,550
survived the hook destruction some of

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:09,080
them are still there so you can you can

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,080
hook there if you if you really want

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:16,860
just this is just the last note widgets

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,830
for matters and field types are now blue

00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:23,940
down now plugins as well so we'll see

00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:26,400
we'll see how do we find those so it's

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,759
where I mean this is a very something I

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,429
struggle with

00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:33,669
seven for a lot of time that if you want

00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:35,380
a formatter for a field that is similar

00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:38,309
to another for matter that you already

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:41,649
have but not quite you have to just

00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:43,749
duplicate the whole thing well now these

00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:45,849
are plugging so you have inheritance and

00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:47,949
you can just overwrite just the parts

00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:50,079
that you're interested and if the other

00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:54,849
thing changes you just carry on the

00:41:50,079 --> 00:42:00,749
chain and this is the thing I notated

00:41:54,849 --> 00:42:04,209
plugins what's that that's the other

00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:07,989
pain point of these this is not a

00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:12,369
comment this is the beach view way of

00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:16,049
supporting annotations inside code so

00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:19,599
you have the field widget you put an ID

00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:22,479
label and then the field types this with

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:27,339
this piece of here this water plays

00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:32,189
hooks like hook feels info or hook feel

00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:34,630
widget info in this case same goes with

00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:37,630
well this is the implementation of the

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,549
widget so for a widget you have said in

00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:42,130
form the form element you have another

00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:44,259
element and my favorite name of

00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:47,049
functional Drupal 8 massage foreign

00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:50,309
bodies which is like a pretty validation

00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:50,309
thing to massage the data

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,730
for mothers are the same thing you have

00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,370
a set inform you have the summary for

00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:03,050
the listing you have a beauty you prefer

00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:07,010
view sorry and sorry and the definition

00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:10,040
of both widgets for mothers and fill

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:13,100
types is similar to this one to the

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,980
annotations so you put the plug-in file

00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:19,220
in the right place with the right

00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,950
annotation and you will get a pin type a

00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:26,530
new field type be careful with this

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:30,170
because if you put if you screw with it

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:32,240
like you put a comma you put a comma

00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,910
where he shouldn't you don't put a comma

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,840
where you should like a formatting thing

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:42,740
you will get that incredible incredibly

00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:45,290
awful doctrine error in your page which

00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,120
is very lives you very clueless so if

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,910
you get that just probably one antigen

00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:53,000
that is not properly formatted waited

00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:56,570
for others and totally recommend it

00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,260
because the field system may be written

00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:02,600
in these two days while we wait there is

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,630
a session with the fill a p.i and the

00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:11,420
entity feel a pea I by the guys had made

00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:17,750
it oh yeah and this is like a blank

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:20,210
slide because without these guys the

00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:23,120
undercover initiatives all these things

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,090
happen but were really necessary and

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,100
really really useful these are many more

00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:31,190
are the responsible and most of them are

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:38,000
here so say thanks or something you see

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:40,790
them oh I'm final I notice there's there

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,950
are sprints the whole week but on Friday

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:46,930
us had very dedicated sprint on all

00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:49,280
these things and more so find

00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:54,550
information there if you if you are

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,550
interested and that's it thank you

00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:07,780
please please please please write the

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,540
session we have two ways to write any

00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,480
system one is in there if you go to

00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:17,110
/schedule in the drupalcon website but

00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,710
we also trying to do writings in joint

00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:23,290
in so if you go to bit ly right d8

00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:27,780
undercover I would much appreciate that

00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:31,780
I don't know we have time for questions

00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,240
yeah you have any question just there's

00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:37,540
Mike there otherwise I'm I'll be

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,900
sticking around for a while so thank you
