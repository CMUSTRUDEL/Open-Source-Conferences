Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: pcambra
Drupal 8 core initiatives introduced a new methodology for Drupal core development, they've helped to focus contributions and efforts very effectively towards the main objectives of the release. All these initiatives, "Views in core", "Multilingual", "Configuration management", "Web services", "Blocks & layouts" and "Mobile" have accomplished really important milestones, key for an innovative and powerful Drupal 8 version.

However, there's a number of other efforts behind the scenes that have brought major changes to Drupal 8.
This session will cover the most important changes that are not necessarily covered by any initiative but the community has made possible. Some of these changes include the way that menus work, field and entity api changes, actions, modules that have made it into core, features removed, etc.

Join me in this talk to take a look to the most relevant changes coming from these often overlooked initiatives that will change the way we face projects in Drupal 8.

This session is intended to site builders and coders willing to know what's going on under the hood of Drupal 8 and get a better understanding on all the changes that are coming.
