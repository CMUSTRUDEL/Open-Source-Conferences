so my name is Jess I and II Oreo thank

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,200
you so much for coming I head up product

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,599
marketing at aquia and as we're sponsors

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,190
of the show we get to do this great

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,660
presentation but what we've learned from

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,460
the audience is they never want to hear

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,170
from us and they just want to hear from

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,430
people giving real world examples so

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,800
we've brought along a great customer

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,539
today and the BBC good food team while

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,460
you guys introduce yourself hi I'm Doug

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,480
McKenzie I'm the product manager for you

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,950
see good food top gear as well hi I'm

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,719
Alan Mackenzie have a readable developer

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:42,390
related once MC ones m.a.c so and I

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,780
would lose my job if I didn't do just a

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,430
couple of minutes on oo quia real quick

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,230
just to get a pulse of the audience we

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,059
typically have a split between those who

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,410
are hands-on development and those who

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,579
are more on the business side could you

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,230
raise your hand if you're hands-on

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,129
technical development okay and then if

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,039
you're more on the business side

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,420
business development 5050 all right we

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,760
will do our best to accommodate both

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,130
audiences and I'm going to start with a

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,689
really brief update of aqua products and

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,520
then we're going to turn it over to the

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,860
BBC good food team to tell their story

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,200
about the evolution of BBC good food

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,820
digital experience so how many people in

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
this room are confused by what Acquia

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,100
does what we sell what our products are

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,420
one brave soul i would i would guess

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,070
pretty much everybody in this m i'm

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,100
confused sometimes it's my job to make

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,659
it simple so most people have a hard

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,130
time understanding when we have

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,020
different offerings how it all comes

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,900
together and how we help customers and

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,640
unified way so we are releasing the Aqua

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,399
platform which is really just a unified

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,840
way to learn about what we do in harmony

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,149
with Drupal and the products and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,820
services we do that surround successful

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,530
Drupal implementations agility is a

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,240
great thing to talk about when we're

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,680
talking about the position of Drupal and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,140
how that's going to help organizations

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,060
move faster in the digital age when

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,710
digital disruption is making everything

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,619
much more competitive and you have to

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,880
have updates social integration etc and

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,520
you're going to hear about how BBC good

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,030
food has worked with the mobile access

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,410
challenge so agility is necessary

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,550
resiliency is

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,620
is what we talk about when we talk about

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,630
aqua cloud are there any aqua cloud

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,340
users in the audience okay great when we

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,570
talk about resiliency people typically

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,640
think of it as something that's just

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,260
about the hardware side of the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,300
infrastructure side they think of it as

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,190
up time but we think about it a little

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,560
bit differently we provide a holistic

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,970
set of tools that allow you to make sure

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,800
the application quality is where it

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,780
needs to be before you launch the site

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,890
so ideally the infrastructure is kind of

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,840
an afterthought and it's all about

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,460
getting the application ready to scale

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,860
so we have a host of tools that help

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,380
ensure application quality like aqua

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,390
insight which does a lot of testing on

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,560
the application proactively helps you

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,470
understand what needs to be improved

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,570
across performance security and general

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,160
Drupal best practices so for more

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,660
information on this type of thing it's

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,130
not planned in the presentation today

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,230
but I'm happy to talk with anyone after

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,630
or you can go to the Aqua booth and we

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,750
have amazing engineers and product team

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,280
members ready to do great demos for you

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,500
the aqua platform is about agility with

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,750
Drupal resiliency with Acquia cloud and

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,790
then connectedness which is both a

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,130
Drupal value proposition because it's

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,510
about the ease of integration with

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,910
whatever technologies have already

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,190
implemented in your portfolio and then

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,170
it's also about how aqua can help you

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,660
get that next mile when you have a

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,430
unique implementation or integration you

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,420
need to work through with Drupal and our

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,220
team can help you through that so we

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,380
talked about the resilient cloud it's

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,489
scalable reliable and secure and you're

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,350
not going to be able to see all of these

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,260
because of the technical issues but this

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:53,520
is sort of a quick update was anyone at

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,290
triple con Prague okay so we really just

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,850
wanted to do a recap of what's new since

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,130
then and there's a there's a tremendous

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,450
amount of innovation that's going into

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,090
the Aqua a platform at any point in time

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,040
but a few really exciting releases are

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,950
aqua inside I talked about as this

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,360
testing tool we released both an API and

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,489
the ability to create your own custom

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
tests so it's not just us projecting

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,430
tests upon your application that we

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,720
think you should care about you can

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,820
dismiss them if they're not important

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,739
and you can add your own test to it so

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,260
that way the application becomes custom

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,910
to your unique needs so we think that's

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,060
been really powerful for developers in

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,440
particular teams and permissions is all

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,090
about making sure the right people have

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,490
access to do the right things with anak

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,290
whea and that was really critical from

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,520
our partner community that we create

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,460
that and I think it's helpful for

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,130
general development teams as well second

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,840
version of dev desktop is a release

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,180
candidate right now just as a couple of

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,010
highlights and then we came up with a

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,570
bunch of platform monitoring tools

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,520
platform health and other ways to

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,320
interrogate performance issues whether

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,880
its application or and we have our own

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,190
that we've been created for our own

00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,780
infrastructure to spot-check there the

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,430
digital experience solutions this is

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,320
really just how we position Drupal and

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,479
we talk about modules we talk about

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,639
distributions and we talked about many

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,710
ways to get started you can start from

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,600
almost at the finish line with

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,070
distributions and this is really

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,479
appealing to companies who haven't

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,830
really gone all-in on Drupal yet and

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,060
they don't understand it and they need

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,590
something that seems a little easier

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,930
seems a little customized for their use

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,370
case so we position that as as digital

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,500
experience solutions and we have

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,630
recently created a new comer strategy

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,950
and this is really about bringing more

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,410
visibility with all the marketing power

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,900
that we can to Drupal being great for

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,550
transactional sites some use cases are

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,940
at Drupal commerce is perfect for and

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,229
some use cases where there's a

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,080
significant investment in the backend

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,210
commerce platform we've created a new

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,830
use case we call content for commerce so

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,210
use Drupal for that better content

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,460
experience which drives better

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,919
engagement give marketing more control

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,660
and keep your ecommerce platform as the

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,740
plumbing and what makes the transactions

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,300
go and the post sale support so in terms

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,440
of technical innovation for that we're

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,120
actually working through our connector

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,680
strategy and we started with a company

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,880
called demandware which is a well-known

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,470
commerce platform and last thing I'm

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,090
going to give you an update on is the

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,250
most exciting thing that we've done this

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:21,930
year is launched aquia lifts anybody

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,860
heard of aqua lift great well should we

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,990
have time towards the end of the

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,729
presentation Steve Smith our vp of

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,320
engineering farokh we lift is going to

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,360
give a quick demo but it is a

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,250
personalization solution that's that's

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,960
tailor-made for Drupal many

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,760
organizations struggle with what's

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,530
called shadow CMS when they go to test

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,620
they have to create duplicate content in

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,910
another CMS

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,010
sit and when they get the results then

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,720
they come back to implement but this is

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,139
all embedded within Drupal they've

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,220
created great technical innovation that

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,720
they've contributed back to the

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,600
community and then we have our own

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,250
service that we also sell but it's

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,410
embedded in your workflow you don't have

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,530
a redundant content system you have to

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,240
go to it drives relevance we acquired a

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,530
company called true centric this last

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,690
year which is also very exciting and

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,030
that's how we acquired Steve and his

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,550
excellent talent and they bring offers

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,710
and recommendations the table and this

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,000
little logo you see here smart that is

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,180
to be continued we'll be launching

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,770
another product in November so that's

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,660
really about real-time data management

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,699
and bringing in different profiles of

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,930
known and unknown users we're very

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,600
excited about the digital engagement

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,240
services we feel like one of the things

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,060
that we owe the Drupal community is to

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,590
help enterprises think of Drupal as an

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,050
enterprise solution so we have to close

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,910
gaps in point solutions that our

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,039
competitors like Adobe incite core offer

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,080
they've acquired these technology areas

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,810
so we're doing everything we can to

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,340
invest in making drupal's seem much more

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,889
appropriate for the enterprise and

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,870
providing the right level of integration

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,090
with existing marketing systems and

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,860
really trying to give Drupal 01 up with

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,660
embedded solutions that help drive

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,130
better engagement and at the end of the

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,280
day impact the bottom line for whatever

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:03,039
your business outcome is so we launched

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,380
aquia lift in February we were able to

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,000
launch offers and recommendations in

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,949
July which is when we acquired true

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,419
centric and then we're working towards

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,210
integrated view of the customer which

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,830
was what I was just teeing up there so I

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,539
would love to talk to anybody who is

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,220
interested in learning more again we'll

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,990
do a quick demo of the personalization

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,330
solution if we have time towards the end

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,320
but unless there any questions right now

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:31,440
at this point I'm going to turn it over

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,440
to the BBC all right guys thank you

00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:57,050
alright

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,790
right thanks to everyone for going

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,710
there's a huge number of people here

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,480
which is slightly terrifying than also

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:09,850
very exciting at the same time oh hello

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,680
is that better great yeah I can do that

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,490
multitask click and speaking a

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,970
microphone thanks so we're going to talk

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,370
about BBC good food today I just wanted

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,660
to get a show of hands who'd heard a BBC

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,420
good food apart from the people who

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,860
worked in it before they saw it in the

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,700
program changing short of Hatton's ok

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:38,360
and how many people that are from the UK

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,590
yeah it matches up ok interesting so as

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,520
you can probably tell from that straw

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:47,300
poll it's quite a UK focus website but

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,400
the brand itself is this sort of huge NC

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,710
which actually turned 25 years old this

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,080
month came out of a big magazine

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,930
business and we're just celebrating our

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,330
birth to this month as I said and it's

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,490
quite large scoping it's not just about

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,710
this website we've got books some of the

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,450
most popular cooking books in the UK are

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,280
from BBC good food we've got print

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,960
magazines from all over the world and

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,550
we're hoping our digital business

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,560
business will eventually turn the same

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,330
way but just to give you a sense of

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,400
what's really cool to the product we

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,470
have over 7,000 recipes that are triple

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,050
tested on the website and that's really

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,580
at the heart of them so a couple of

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:27,160
stats for people who don't know about

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:30,350
BBC good food angle I hope this works

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,860
amazing we get about 11 million users a

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,660
month and the majority from the UK and

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,260
we're growing about fifty percent

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,210
year-on-year we also get huge spikes and

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,820
events such as Christmas Eve where last

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:47,150
Christmas we got just over 1 million

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,740
users coming to our site and what

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,030
percentage and this is why I'm watching

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,910
you guys a question that seems really

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:56,450
harsh what percentage of seshu sessions

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:59,990
do you think comes from to device groups

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,670
so say iphone and ipad how many sessions

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,090
do you think our all our sessions come

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:11,650
from those two devices anyone chat up

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,390
forty percent eighty forty percent its

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,460
forty four percent just from those two

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,440
devices and we have to pay so much

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,380
attention just to those devices in terms

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,900
of as interesting talked earlier about

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,940
the next steps for UX in the world and

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,200
everyone sort of ignoring just a couple

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,790
of devices and thinking about the broad

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,800
advices I think it does come back to

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,240
business value and going these are the

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,320
two biggest devices we should probably

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,020
focus most our effort on those so yeah

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,210
two big devices we all just rear and it

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,190
literally last thursday i was up till

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,930
country war hour to make sure this went

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,280
out on the dots in line with a print

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,520
magazine the book and everything else

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,340
probably not just a digital brand so

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,930
what we're going to talk about today um

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,880
we're going to cover really the good

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,930
food rewrites and where we've come to

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,730
now we're going to talk about the

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,640
challenges and why we did the project

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,370
the approaches we took the results that

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,360
really came out of that so first of all

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:10,180
the challenges so there were really

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,980
three core ones one was the changing

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,560
user behaviors so the changing in their

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,760
habits the second was really internal it

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,860
was around the fact we didn't really

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
have a proper build measure learn Lee

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,230
that's not really an approach we had

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,330
before and the third was really around

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,280
the editorial team it's so cool to our

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,380
work getting content live was really

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,610
difficult on the old system and the

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,890
stability wasn't great of the old stack

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,360
so first of all the changing habits now

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,520
the original website that was built I

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,380
think seven eight years ago was really

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,640
focused around one core user journey a

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,890
user in this environment went to their

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,080
desktop computer they printed a recipe

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,880
and then they went and cooked it unless

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,460
they had a kitchen like this which is

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,680
probably quite rare but we noticed there

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,030
was a quite a change in user behavior in

00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,710
the last few years which I'm sure you

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,720
will notice across the board but really

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,010
affected us quite a lot the fact that

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,410
people were starting to cook with

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,730
tablets in their kitchen and they were

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,800
taking their mobile phones into the

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,720
supermarkets with say an ingredients

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,700
list in the hands or in their notes and

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,730
searching for recipes even in store

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,950
looking for inspiration we saw this in

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,700
our numbers as well this was before we

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,590
relaunch we

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,720
we're seeing growth but actually seeing

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,170
even bigger growth in mobile and tablet

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,270
quite dramatically the second challenge

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,680
for us was the lack of the build measure

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,150
learn loop does everyone know what that

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,120
means I mean it's probably quite

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,410
self-explanatory but just the fact we

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,720
weren't really putting things out there

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,400
testing and then iterating on that which

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,720
is kind of standard practice now but

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,510
back then we weren't really doing it so

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,260
the problem with our loop was the fact

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:52,120
that the bill took too long the multiple

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,440
systems are too complicated we were

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,900
worried when we rolled something out

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,690
there was good break the sites we didn't

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,000
really have a great analytics solution

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,530
you know we had GA but it wasn't really

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,300
well set up we weren't really tracking

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,640
everything that actually was business

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,360
value for the product or a huge amount

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,650
of expertise around that tool and they

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,200
were just not really a culture of

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,790
learning and building on that we really

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,260
focused on getting as many features out

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,210
the door which I'm sure the case for a

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,670
lot of people at the time rather than

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,140
actually delivering any value and our

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,290
third thing as an interesting before was

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,640
about time to publish and stability so

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,460
just a bit of background how our

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,330
editorial team work there's actually a

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,950
kitchen in West London where we have a

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,320
team of people who cook these recipes

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,670
for us before we put them online the

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,500
great thing about layers they cook them

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,620
three times and we get to eat all of

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,340
them I think it's quite important perk

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,850
to my job sort of up there on the list

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:55,450
of benefits the food money no eat food

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,190
that's fine and every month the

00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,020
editorial team upload about 70 new

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,570
recipes as well as a multitude of other

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,780
content videos guides yeah you know how

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,130
to eat healthy this month now the

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,780
problems we had where there were

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,300
multiple systems at least two or three

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,010
just to create a recipe the systems

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,330
really didn't talk to each other very

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,770
well it's probably a much better

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,810
technical way of describing that but I

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,150
think lack of discussion is it's the

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,400
best way and it took between 20 to 30

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,530
minutes just to do one recipe which is

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,150
about three working days a month just

00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,800
uploading recipes that have already been

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,480
cooked already been published in a

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,390
magazine and we're weighing three days

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,610
to get all that content live

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,260
now we could have said this so the

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,760
editorial team and having that have been

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,660
that happy about that they'd have

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,190
probably ended up looking like this

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,360
another issue for us was around

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,980
stability so we have big peak traffic

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,570
spikes at lunch time they're really

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,190
obvious times lunch time you're hungry

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,080
you want to look at recipes and see what

00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,510
to cook and then just before you go home

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,620
really starving and you've no idea what

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,180
you're going to eat tonight and you want

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,920
to look up some recipes so when you pop

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,980
in to Tesco's or as there or any other

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,480
good retailer you've got something

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,430
you've got some inspiration you know

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,170
what to cook we're also really driven

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,820
and that's again probably obvious by

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,880
massive peak events Pancake Day

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,130
Christmas as i showed before valentine's

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:20,180
day on which the most popular recipe is

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:24,900
onion rings what's that valentine's day

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:28,070
yeah oh yes it is as well great bridge

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,140
is that what it's called over here

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,610
that's right it's a very important event

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,830
for us as well yeah we do a lot of

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,080
content around there now our problem in

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,770
i think a descriptive human way was

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,370
probably like this yeah these these

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,290
hard-working japanese trained staff push

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,390
literally cramming people onto the train

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,860
and that's really what we were doing but

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,540
the problem for us is we didn't get a

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,730
full train we tends to get a page like

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,800
this which wasn't really ideal for our

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,660
users and it's intriguing for it

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,020
probably happened twice a week when it

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,060
was really bad so the challenge we faced

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,010
was the user their behaviors were

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,390
changing they always are we didn't

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,400
really have a build measure learn loop

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,089
and we weren't really quick at getting

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,620
content live or having a staple sites so

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:18,420
our approach to this for the changing

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,890
user behavior habits something that

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,540
sounds really obvious now but we looked

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,130
at responsive design it's the first time

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,400
BBC Worldwide have really looked at it

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,530
when we approached good foods for the

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,050
build measured learn loop the key for us

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,110
was tools process changes and really

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,690
mindset of the whole team to change and

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,660
for speed to publish and stability I can

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,120
really go to drupalcon and not say this

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,320
drupal was key for us and also a cloud

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,519
infrastructure which

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,250
a queer or like me saying because it's

00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:52,230
theirs so responsive design in response

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,870
to the changing user habits we really

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,490
focused around three core platforms we

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,559
looked at mobile we looked at tablet we

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,049
look to desktop we focus these around

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,240
lifestyle choices so a user in a

00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,250
supermarket with their mobile a user in

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,259
the kitchen with a tablet and someone at

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,039
work at their desk looking at recipes at

00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:13,740
lunch time so this is what we did for

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,059
mobile we really focused at minimizing

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,940
the amount of content at the top and

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,279
just having a lovely recipe images which

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,000
is what users care about the most we've

00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:25,500
discovered for tablets we made it a bit

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,200
more of a browsing experience you know

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,049
swipe across content really enjoy the

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,730
depth of it and the big images and then

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,620
for desktop we still really have to have

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,350
a great desktop experience we've got

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,929
quite an older audience than probably a

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,110
lot of sites that the rest the audience

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,940
here work on and it's caught its key to

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,509
us is having a really good desktop

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,340
website so process and mindset changes

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,740
there were really three key things we

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,330
did here one was user testing again

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,970
really obvious now but we've never done

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,470
it before the second was around changing

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,419
the team dynamic and the ways that work

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,399
and Alan McKenzie here we'll talk for

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,799
hours on length about how to best have

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:07,889
the greatest team dynamic to get the the

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,090
best work done and the final thing was

00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:11,399
having the right tools to be able to do

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,200
the job so it does not do things like

00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:14,820
this we've actually got a user testing

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,590
lab we're really fortunate i know not

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,779
everyone has this having a user testing

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,419
lab in our building literally it's sort

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,820
of a dual room set up where we can film

00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,259
people where we watch them interact with

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,600
our product sounds quite creepy at first

00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:28,919
but then you get a stakeholder in a room

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,990
watching it it's amazing how many people

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,759
you can convince just by someone

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,700
clicking through on a button we didn't

00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,470
think they click and we also did beta

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,600
tests we put a bee to test live to a

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,940
great group of people who are actually

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,470
really being a real good food users to

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,389
test our product the second thing was

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,240
around as I said ways of working that we

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:54,000
change we changed our team set up so

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,679
that the designer the UX lead and the

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,340
lead developer were actually involved in

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,309
our whiteboard

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,720
process it wasn't just let the designer

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,250
and the product person go off design

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,900
something crazy that's impossible to

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,240
implement and then come and present it

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,029
to a developer who then probably pull

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,679
their hair out and go this is impossible

00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,090
so we really did change that and just

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,350
make it more dialogue driven and it's

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,360
amazing actually when you bring that

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,520
community of people together how great

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,740
it is you know that you get much better

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,220
products out to them and a key tool for

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,080
us was around impact mapping it's so

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,880
important to understand no matter what

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,919
role you're in why you're doing

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,840
something I think you'd be internally

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,240
eternally frustrating if you don't know

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,740
that and it speeds up development so

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,720
much and I've talked to Alan a lot about

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,860
this if you know when he's building

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,090
something he knows why he's doing

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,860
something he'll take the logical

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,690
approach based on that we won't have to

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,490
go back and forth 50 times discussing

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,960
every mine you sure approach you'll know

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,149
why is doing something so we'll know the

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,309
best approach I think most importantly

00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:54,450
it's not about software it's about the

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,640
business duvall you that you deliver and

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,350
the final thing that we started to use

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,539
and used on that approach was

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,299
multi-variant testing again it was

00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,770
something quite new to me and it's an

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,960
amazingly powerful tool this is really

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:10,049
simple and quite boring example so

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,340
apologies but we we tested for different

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:15,720
magazine subscription trials on our

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,890
website it's you know it's a really

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,279
important thing to our business it's

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,740
still key to our revenue um out of those

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:26,340
four on the it is the left for you the

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:30,210
four pink ones who thinks the 5 45 pound

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,190
one the tests that we ran who think

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,720
they're save up to forty percent on the

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,260
test we're looking for delivering

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,450
business value so the most conversion to

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,630
subscriptions who think saved twenty

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,990
five percent interesting and who thinks

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:49,260
save up to seventy four percent

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,330
interesting so um one thing if you have

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,549
quite limited analytics on these sort of

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,429
tests is you can get completely no

00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,380
results so the click-through rate on all

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,510
of those was exactly the same the

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,500
important thing that we discovered was

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,530
actually when they got to the

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,840
subscription sides the most value that

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,840
were delivered was by that 5 45 pound

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,880
offer like that out of anything

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,929
delivered the most value I think that's

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,250
one thing that I've learned that's

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,510
really important it's not just about

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,710
click-through rate on the page it's

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,600
actually what's the end goal you're

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,010
trying to get to and I know that

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,419
actually getting the analytics to do

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,400
that is quite a pain a lot at the time

00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,779
but doing the work to have these tests

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,039
is only really worthwhile if you've got

00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,900
a true result out there and the final

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,460
thing in our approach was around Drupal

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,929
and cloud infrastructure it's not

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,640
something I've really heard of so two

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,909
and a half years ago I'll be honest

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,650
scruple and I've learned a lot and this

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:42,299
is my first drupalcon I'm sure there's a

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:47,070
badge I should be wearing saying this is

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:48,899
my first drupalcon and alan's probably

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,610
best to talk about this but this is what

00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:53,370
is really changed from our sort of

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,750
culture internally one of you we started

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,330
to say things like someone's already

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,279
built that make it truthfully or Drupal

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,870
eyes the problem which again two years

00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,240
ago I would have no idea what you're

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,740
talking about no second two points but

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,750
the benefits I've learned from that are

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,760
we don't build a moat around our systems

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,990
they're not necessarily unique to us a

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,820
lot of people have built the same thing

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,740
before it's really quick to onboard

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,870
people you can pick up anyone and drop

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,100
them in a team and other than the team

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,529
dynamic actually understanding the

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,010
system it's quite quick and it's less

00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:24,929
risky in terms of rolling out stuff and

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,399
it's a lot quicker to get to market I've

00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,450
got an example later I'll show you on

00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:31,770
that and then we moved and this is

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,899
probably how you should celebrate cloud

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,380
infrastructure from an internal stack to

00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:39,690
the clouds Alan's got this quote that

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,090
there's no secret source to our our

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,789
cloud infrastructure it's just a

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,080
standard Acquia cloud infrastructure but

00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:47,970
the great thing about it i've discovered

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,230
is the scalability of it we don't have

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,750
to have all these servers running the

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,789
whole time when we hit 1.2 million users

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,830
at Christmas we can scale up for that we

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,380
don't have to have that you know that

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,240
service always around you want to speak

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,220
any more on that Alan better than that

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,300
cool

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:08,910
silent as always ok so then on to our

00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,880
results so these are the things we were

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,010
trying to change we were trying to meet

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,900
the change news behavior we were trying

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,280
to establish a build measure learn loop

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,960
and we're really trying to reduce

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,330
editorial work flowing increase the

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,340
stability so for the change in use of

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,520
the behavior responsive design was at

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,020
the heart of that change for us so prior

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,390
to the relaunch and apologies if you

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,350
can't see this graph from the back we

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:36,720
had desktop which was greater than

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,670
mobile and tablets you can see sort of

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,800
the divide and it's pretty consistent

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,480
there was you know there was a sort of a

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,950
curve coming you can see towards the end

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,860
of that graph but it was pretty

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,510
consistent throughout the year literally

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,690
the week after we relaunch the

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,480
responsive site this is what happened

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,970
they literally flipped so users were

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,650
waiting for a response a product or a

00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,910
product that work well for them on their

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,230
mobile and tablet rather than being

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,550
responsive they just wanted something

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,280
that worked really good for them they

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,690
started using those devices immediately

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,760
as soon as we offered that feature for

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,500
them and that has only just can that's

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,500
only really continued to grow since then

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,960
so second really establishing this build

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,880
measure lonely I keep harping on about

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,460
and I think the best thing to do just

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,290
give a really quick example of one thing

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,780
we've done recently that has benefited

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,150
from this so we wanted to add a new

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,650
social sharing bar to the site when we

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,810
did the relaunch we quickly through one

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,790
up as you do in there so the last days

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,380
before you go live you go we haven't put

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,640
that on halfway so you quickly throw

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,830
something up and this was the first

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,710
iteration we had it's from a third party

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,420
there was three core options there was a

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,040
 there was an expandable button at

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,500
the end which had when you expanded

00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,510
about 500 options for sharing which i

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,880
think is probably not necessary to most

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,980
people in the world and that's what the

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,990
first iteration looked like we white

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,000
boarded we use a test as a load of

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,640
different new designs across mobile

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,480
tablet and desktop and this is what we

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,730
came up with we added pinterest which

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,500
sounds really obvious but until we look

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,330
to the data we were like of course it's

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,700
a food web site with lovely food images

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,889
of course everyone uses pinch

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,659
rest and shares good food on it but we

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,370
were prioritizing Facebook and Twitter

00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:22,159
like the rest of the world when we first

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:24,110
did the first iteration and also we put

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,159
email up there which is surprisingly

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,110
important the amount of people that

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,850
email the recipe to their mobile phone

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:32,480
so they can take it to the store is it

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:34,190
surprised me and the reason this

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,899
happened was because of the dialogue

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,210
between all of us we all sort of

00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,649
inputted in this design and the output

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,860
was a five hundred percent increase in

00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:44,809
sharing overnight and that's really

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,330
continued it hasn't so it wasn't sort of

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:50,510
a one-off peak is just continuing to

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:53,029
grow and our final thing that we wanted

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,529
to change was reduce the time to input

00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,950
the editors really increase the

00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,110
stability of the site very simply it

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,029
took about 30 minutes before to put a

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,620
recipe in and you ended up with quite a

00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:05,179
frustrated editor by the end of it in

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,940
our only takes 15 minutes for the

00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,769
biggest recipe that is sort of so we've

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,169
reduced that by half which i think is

00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,700
great so the edges you can spend a lot

00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,409
more time just writing content and

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,320
devising great strategy rather than

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,820
focusing on systems and the stability of

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,880
the site i'm sorry now how many great

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,630
numbers around up times you know ninety

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,700
nine point four percent up it basically

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,740
doesn't go down like it used to anymore

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,179
it's quite i've learnt you know we're

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,799
not getting as many users emailing us

00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,779
complaining it's down we're not seeing

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,519
it go down when we hit a peak traffic of

00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,960
4pm on the thursday and we all panic

00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,120
going what do we do it just doesn't

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,980
happen anymore and we also manage

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,889
massive Peaks so much better so

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,210
christmas eve last year 1.2 million we

00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:49,370
had you know I did traffic projections

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,480
as anyone does particular when you're

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,340
working with a cloud infrastructure

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,299
you're trying to forecast how many

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,760
servers you're going to need and how

00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,889
much you need to pay for Christmas and

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,870
we just didn't know really we sort of

00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:03,980
estimated but it was much bigger than we

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,929
even expected and that's what we've

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,669
ended up with Arthur's rewrites a great

00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:11,289
responsive design product that just

00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:11,289
continues to grow so thank you

00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,810
thank you guys I'm going to invite steve

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,610
up to get ready to see if we want to do

00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:31,470
the demo but at this point we would love

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:33,930
to take questions so many questions so

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,450
at the moment it's a lot lower than we'd

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,040
hope in terms of it's not something

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,640
we've really focused on is what I'd say

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,410
when we rewrote the site we we had a

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,180
binder functionality which basically

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,490
allows users to save recipes to their

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,350
binder we haven't particularly expanded

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,420
on that since the relaunch and that's

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,770
something for our strategy so the

00:28:51,420 --> 00:29:01,910
percentage is pretty small at the moment

00:28:52,770 --> 00:29:01,910
or hoping that'll great yeah

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:13,890
I will pass this to Alan it allows this

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:15,300
far better than me the gentleman is

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,270
interested in whether or not we use a

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:29,520
CDN dancers yes we use Akamai and we

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:30,780
cache pages as well as static assets so

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,730
the question is we're doing our traffic

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,970
from oh no all that Duncan Hines than

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:39,750
that one so the majority is organic

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,280
search a massive percentage as so we're

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,110
quite relying on google is how I'd say

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,660
and that was a big thing which I didn't

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,620
really mention for the rewrite was

00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:50,160
reformatting all our metadata and

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:53,750
actually surfacing a lot more of it any

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,750
more questions one of the back

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,780
it's a very good question it's not a

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:16,000
decision I made personally it was a sort

00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,100
of a decision we made as a group a

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,300
technology group overall there was

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,340
probably quite a lot of thought that

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,870
went into that I imagine there were some

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,820
of the benefits but I'll probably let

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,360
Alan explain probably why from a

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,929
technical point of view so cost it's

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,760
cheap and time-to-market is excellent it

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,290
suits media companies extremely well

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,950
because Drupal does content Col Marston

00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,660
community very well the IP is run by the

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:45,370
community rather than by a hostile

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:47,530
company so we'd have to worry about I

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:56,350
was getting price gouging future if we

00:30:47,530 --> 00:31:01,450
went with propriety CMS cost exile yes

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,630
cause some flexibility anymore for

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,630
anymore

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:16,250
so was that house the maintenance going

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:16,250
just cheated so I could just repeat that

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:28,200
since the relaunch so that was July last

00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:31,290
year yeah I will pass to Alan right so

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,090
there's been occasional pieces of tuning

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,980
various SQL queries but there's been

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,710
continuous product development that has

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,970
not really been that much maintenance

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:50,510
there's been certainly an awful lot less

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:50,510
than the old system yeah we update

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:25,409
did you also so we continue to use

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,120
google analytics I would say one thing

00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:29,340
we started to do which we weren't doing

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,200
say two years ago was as we were rolling

00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,169
out features one we were thinking about

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,909
what the kpi's of these and in this at

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,220
the same time we were rolling out the

00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:40,679
functionality to track that if it was GA

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,039
events no or something a bit smarter

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,850
than that but um yeah it's just again it

00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,280
wasn't something that was taught about

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,539
we put things out and go oh how do we

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,340
measure this and then we'd implement the

00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,809
measurement afterwards and it's just who

00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,400
is bringing that into the process

00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:54,870
overall in terms of performance

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,640
monitoring Alan will probably speak

00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,850
better than that but we're looking to

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,610
expand on what we monitor in terms of

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,990
app monitoring as well as just more

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:09,419
traditional monitoring so that's what a

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:11,990
buncha question right anymore person the

00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,990
orange t-shirt

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,110
in terms of there's not that so the

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,570
question was this well it's more an

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,420
observation I think there's not that

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,010
many fancy parts on the web sites in

00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,730
terms of moving things is that fair

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,500
enough so I would say that actually

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,420
probably came out the UX rather than us

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,670
going we can't do that technically we

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,800
put because of our user base again it

00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,840
needs to be simple and needs to work the

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,360
content sort of at the heart of it we've

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,820
got amazing image areas for our recipes

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,890
we've got great recipes actually if we

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,050
put a fancy you x over it that made it

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,370
difficult for you to find that it would

00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,250
be actually more challenging for a

00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,890
particular user base um I don't know if

00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:05,300
you want to say anything about gloss

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:07,460
versus Drupal or Drupal can certainly do

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,410
gloss but we opted not to because our

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,740
data graphs they just really do like it

00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:15,770
and it was originally had a carousel

00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,500
which moved what I felt was fairly

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,990
slowly but still too fast for some of

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:26,830
our user base we had to tune it learn

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,830
the lady in red of the back

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:07,069
I'll let Duncan out to the community

00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:09,140
question first so I sort of hinted it to

00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:11,240
it earlier but we've got a function

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,630
called my good food which sounds very

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,319
self-explanatory which other minute is

00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:20,809
quite limited it allows users to save

00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:23,150
recipes to their binder in effect so

00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,470
that's with their storage area they can

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,269
create collections of content as well

00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,680
but they can also comment on the site

00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:29,210
one thing we're looking to do

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,390
particularly on the robot for the next

00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,339
two years is really to drive that

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,589
functionality ARP so offering you know

00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:38,059
gamification opportunities where now

00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:39,650
we've got some really engage users who

00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,329
are spending up to i think it's 10 to 12

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,160
minutes some of our users come and spend

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:44,839
on the site and we're not really

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,519
offering a huge amount to sort of

00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,319
benefit them or reward them and that's

00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,910
sort of the next step for me is to grow

00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:52,430
that and hopefully grow the community

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:56,690
because of that we'll talk about

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:58,460
responsive so we show all our content we

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,380
don't hide any of it it just gets pushed

00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:08,599
further down the page we keep it really

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:10,819
simple add quick question when you said

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,619
you took the time from 30 minutes down

00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,029
to 15 does that include uploading all

00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,589
their sorts of multimedia if you have

00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:17,329
some video attached to the recipes as

00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:21,019
well or is it just the publication of

00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,430
the written content so it's images text

00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:28,220
everything that goes with that recipe

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:32,440
yeah I better take the one just behind

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,440
you when first with a great grey jumper

00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,950
that's a very good question I wish we

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,590
had real-time demographic information it

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:50,950
would be a blessing and I know GA have

00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,930
started to introduce demo information

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,360
which i think is still based on survey

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,130
or usage of other sites so it's still a

00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,040
bit finger in the air I think true

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:03,100
demographics against your user base yes

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,770
we have done surveys to across the whole

00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,060
brand we did a huge one recently which

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,730
we're actually talking about on the site

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,100
at the moment but I don't think I

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:15,490
demographic hugely changed I think that

00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,930
audience was waiting for a response of

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,190
product to work well on their mobile and

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,390
tablets they're not the sort of people

00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,830
that would put up with something that

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,750
doesn't work they just go and use the

00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,310
device that it works for them on we

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,840
really have to bring it to them that's

00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,220
why I said we learned that to answer

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,110
your question I don't think our

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,110
demographic has dramatically changed now

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:50,300
in sorry in one sense she means trying

00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,940
to speak to man you so we did some

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,400
slight customization all you have to

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,230
know is that the recipe form is actually

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,700
quite complicated so we supply our

00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,250
ingredients into multiple different

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:05,240
parts so we can feed that information to

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,740
other systems for instance automatically

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,870
fill a shopping cart on a target

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,170
supermarket website with all the

00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,910
ingredients in a recipe so there is

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:27,500
necessary complexity and we can't really

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:29,930
do much about that yes no white shirt um

00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,820
I would say there's actually been a

00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,850
change we made quite recently we good

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,880
food where we the kitchen that I

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,920
described earlier is now a Content hub

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,510
for every platform rather than an issue

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,310
you know in the past it was yeah

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,310
probably more focussed on print mainly

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,200
because we had recipes coming out in the

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,030
magazine first that's definitely

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,640
starting to change that whole culture I

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,550
think one opportunity the web gives us

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,350
that print doesn't is when there are

00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,790
trending themes that come up you know

00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:02,090
bake-off is something you can plan for

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,800
but when courgettes like two months ago

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,320
suddenly became amazing popular because

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,170
there was a massive over delivery of

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,820
courgettes in the UK supermarkets were

00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,720
flooded with an interesting facts I know

00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,980
about food that started trending on our

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
site and that's not something you can

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,610
wrap reactor in a mag that needs to be

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,460
printed six weeks before it goes on

00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,020
shelves so it just allows us to be a lot

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,460
more reactive so I say that's the sort

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,700
of content we can really deliver a run

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,700
web

00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:47,599
yes I agree and something we're looking

00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:49,499
at in the future is potentially using

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,720
Drupal it sort of the hub for all

00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:53,220
content publishing that's not a place

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,079
where at yeah but it's certainly

00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,789
something yeah I guess you've got to get

00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,559
the problem is you're you're working

00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:00,329
with a print team a used to working in

00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,289
photoshop or indesign and these sort of

00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,869
things and that's where they're putting

00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:10,039
the continent but I agree it's something

00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:10,039
to change the future and yes

00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,750
yeah so we use that via solar search

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,850
with search api is quite large index

00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:29,120
with just over just under a million

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:32,020
documents i think yes and then they are

00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,020
in TJ again

00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,859
we don't it yes it's a difficult we

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,450
don't currently dynamically feed it from

00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:51,010
Drupal again it's something we'd like to

00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,900
do in the future it's building that

00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:55,780
infrastructure and rebuilding those apps

00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,210
in that manner and it's certainly

00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,109
something we've talked about doing

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,790
weeding that's important for me with

00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:02,589
apps is working out what their product

00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,329
proposition is separate to a responsive

00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:06,250
site it's a really tricky one and I

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:08,170
think a lot people none of our

00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,660
competitive really cracked it either and

00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,130
why do you have a native app and for me

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,210
there's one core reason it's a

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,680
completely different marketing

00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,319
opportunity you've got the power of

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,420
Apple and Google which is great but you

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:20,829
still need to have a reasoning why why

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,300
is this product different to the one on

00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:25,329
the web why wouldn't someone just save

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,950
it to their home screen on an iPhone but

00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:28,869
there are different audience bases and

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,040
some audience bases go into the App

00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:31,810
Store and they live in the app store

00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,410
there and live in browser like a lot of

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,880
us do so yeah I think it's just what to

00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,220
answer your question we don't currently

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,780
power them but yes we still are looking

00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,960
at separate product strategies for them

00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,940
and in terms of the size the good food

00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,730
the main good food app we have has it

00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,470
just over two million downloads I'll ask

00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,300
one more question so one of the coolest

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,710
pieces of your experience from my

00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,839
perspective is that you can create

00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,550
select recipe and get that grocery list

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,770
fired off to the retailer of your choice

00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,660
how did you establish that what are your

00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,970
partnerships look like do you get any

00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,310
benefit from that financially by grow

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,079
sure yeah so i can so talk to that

00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,680
probably not in a huge amount of detail

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,210
but to it to a certain degree so yes we

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,550
work with a partner in fact we have a

00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,280
program at beeps worldwide want to plug

00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:21,150
another programmer beeps worldwide

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,859
called bc lamps peace worldwide labs a

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,510
company in the first iteration of BT

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,920
worldwide labs called foo dirty who are

00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,250
now changing to a name I think good

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,410
constant commerce we literally sort of

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:36,339
SAT sort of two deaths from them I went

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:39,640
and chatted to John agonist whose chief

00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:41,290
exec now about what their product

00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,660
offering was and what they offered was

00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,000
the ability for you to buy ingredients

00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,609
from a publishing website through a

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,220
retailer it was kind of a no-brainer

00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:53,920
partnership initially we just I think

00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,140
started with a straw Tesco's and we're

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,960
starting to expand that

00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,310
more and more partners now the

00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,620
functionality at the moment is is

00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,090
limited to just being after shop one

00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,400
recipe at a time which sounds really

00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:08,550
basic but it was a first step to test if

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,410
anyone actually even used it and yes we

00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,270
start to establish retailer relationship

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,800
so we do benefit from land but are our

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,210
future ambition that I probably hinter

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,740
that is not just to be a recipe website

00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,900
we want to be a place that people can

00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,430
come and shop for their weekly shop we

great we are going to move to a very

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,870
brief demo thank you guys so much this

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:51,150
was a wonderful presentation hope

00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:52,620
everybody enjoyed it so let Steve

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,390
introduce himself but he's going to demo

00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,250
the solution that was behind some of the

00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:00,780
testing that BBC good food has been

00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:03,750
working on hi everyone I'm Steve Smith

00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm responsible for the lift product

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:10,730
line at aqua and what I'm going to show

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:15,570
you today is a very quick demo of

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:18,570
testing and targeting and native inside

00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,640
Drupal within the the Drupal publishing

00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,520
experience i'll show you how both of

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:27,110
those things work so this is what I've

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,480
got up here is just one of the stock

00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:35,640
demo framework demos this is the the

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:38,130
nexus travel demo and it has been lift

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,820
has been installed on it so what that

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:46,710
means is as people are engaging with

00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:49,440
content in real time a profile is being

00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:53,070
built about that visitor if they're

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,700
anonymous or identified and being stored

00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:59,580
in real time in the cloud and your we

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,280
build a high-resolution profile about

00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,930
their interests and their behavior so

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,390
first I'm going to show you how as I

00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,580
click on a few pieces of content here

00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,530
the experience is going to personalize

00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,750
I'm then going to show you what the

00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,450
actual profile looks like and the

00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,970
segments that were defined and then how

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:21,690
you target content within drupal and

00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:26,820
then I'll also show you a quick a be

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:28,560
testing example so I'm on this website

00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:32,880
here and you'll see that it's a bunch of

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,880
a bunch of travel related content if I

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:41,310
if I start to look at things like island

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:45,090
life and berto Rico and maybe I start to

00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,710
look at trip packages here so I'm

00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:50,640
looking for some kind of a tropical

00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:54,660
vacation so maybe I look at this this

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:57,780
particular package that's available so

00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,990
what's happening now is this content is

00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,130
tagged with certain attributes that

00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,830
suggests that I'm interested trouble

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:08,280
content that the kind of persona that I

00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:12,060
would fall into and if I go back to the

00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,380
homepage magics supposed to happen which

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,610
it didn't might have been because I was

00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,440
sitting here for a second let me look at

00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,170
a few more pieces of tropical content

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:25,650
here so they get a look at San Juan

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:31,200
tourism and let me go back and look at

00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:34,290
this Porto Rico vacation again all right

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,570
there we go so what has happened is that

00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:40,260
profile has been built in in real time

00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:43,800
and I've fallen into certain segments

00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:47,730
and now that you know this featured

00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:51,450
package is tropical related this this

00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:54,660
hero image is tropical related so let me

00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,950
show you how that actually works in the

00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,420
back end in the cloud what does that

00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:00,480
profile look like and what were the

00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:06,510
segments that made this magic happen so

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:11,180
let me just switch over here to the lift

00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,180
web interface

00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,720
and it timed me out here

00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:30,450
alright so these are all anonymous

00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:38,310
profiles that have been built about this

00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:41,520
user this one here should be should be

00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:43,680
me and so you'll see it's assigned a

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,930
tracking ID just a token and that's

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,910
stored in a cookie so if the user

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,980
returns even if they're anonymous it'll

00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,010
continue building that profile where

00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:58,050
they let left off they've been assigned

00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:59,810
to a getaway type persona based on the

00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,490
content that they were looking at and

00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:06,990
then there's a whole the whole history

00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:09,060
of that user's interests and behavior

00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:13,380
that's being built out here so every

00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:16,320
visit the geography associated with the

00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,150
visit the marketing source the kind of

00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:21,750
device that they're using all of that

00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:24,450
information is being assembled in real

00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,250
time and then all of the things that

00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,780
they actually did on the website so

00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,030
every piece of content that they looked

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,770
at attributes about that content any

00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,580
other kinds of events these could be

00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,650
ecommerce events like I had to cart

00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,570
these could be shares likes any kind of

00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:44,310
event that you wish to instrument can be

00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:46,170
captured in this profile and it gets

00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:50,130
aggregated so that you can pull out

00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:52,650
implicit signals that matter so in this

00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,599
case this particular user the top

00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:58,830
keywords that they were interested in

00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:01,619
spa recreation tropical the top personas

00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:04,410
getaway this clearly was somebody else

00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:06,839
or maybe me in a previous session but

00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:10,020
you'll see how you can pull out those

00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:11,940
signals that that you care about that

00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,240
your users are giving you through what

00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,859
they're doing on your website as well if

00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,180
they identify themselves you can tie

00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:22,050
them together across their different

00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,640
devices and unify their profile so you

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,530
know seeing that the percentage

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,300
breakdown across the different platforms

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:30,960
that they're using within that unified

00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,550
user profile all right so then what you

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,040
can do is you can build segments and

00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,310
these segments can then be shared with

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,330
Drupal and you can

00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:43,420
define content variations that will that

00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:45,340
will reach users depending on whatever

00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,800
criteria you care about the persona they

00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,560
fall into their favorite keywords or

00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,410
geography any combination of things so

00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,660
in this case you'll see this adventure

00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:59,230
persona as a segment that's defined and

00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:02,020
if a person has a persona of adventurer

00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,990
or persona of outdoors and in this case

00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,960
this was just based on taxonomy

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:12,450
assignments to the content then that

00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:18,940
user will fall into this segment and

00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:21,420
then on the Drupal side let me show you

00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,420
how it's set up

00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:40,730
so within drupal here's all the

00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:44,190
different campaigns so these are

00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:48,119
different kinds of targeting campaigns

00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:50,150
as well as testing campaigns so if we

00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,499
look at this one called homepage banner

00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:56,609
we can go in here here's all the

00:50:52,499 --> 00:51:04,920
different variations that are that are

00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:09,509
set for that user and if I if I drill

00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:14,789
into that campaign you can actually see

00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:16,589
the segments that that have been used

00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:21,109
that we're pulled from the cloud from

00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:23,849
the lift web profile so here you'll see

00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:26,579
acquia lift profiles segment persona

00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:30,240
adventure for you know this particular

00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:32,130
variation or interested in tropical or

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,380
persona getaway for this for this

00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,119
variation so this is a way with in

00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,700
Drupal within the native Drupal

00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,249
authoring experience you can use

00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:44,460
predefined content in combination with

00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:46,890
these with these real time segments to

00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,109
hit you know different people with

00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,029
different characteristics in your

00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:56,849
audience set with with different

00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:58,999
experiences so I'll show you very

00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:05,430
quickly I've got one minute left I hear

00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:07,499
what what testing looks like so if if I

00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:10,769
want to do a test it's just as simple as

00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,480
saying I want to create a new campaign

00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:14,910
and actually let me just make sure i've

00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,109
i've got the site loaded up here in the

00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:21,920
background so let's say i want to do a

00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:21,920
new campaign

00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:33,490
I want to do an a/b test I'm going to

00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:40,660
give it a creative name like example

00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:43,210
test and then I can select any element

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:47,290
on the page that I'm interested in

00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:52,240
creating a variation against so I can

00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:55,980
click on bike the USA i can say i want

00:52:52,240 --> 00:53:01,750
to change that to bike the USA right now

00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:04,600
and now i've just defined a variation i

00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:08,110
can then set up goals which can be any

00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,330
sort of page or click or some kind of

00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:13,120
thing that the visitor is done on the

00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:15,820
website and start this test up within

00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:21,010
seconds and start collecting data and

00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:28,420
understand which one's my winter that's

00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:29,860
it java sea can you clarify quickly you

00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,300
can use that microphone what has been

00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,160
contributed back to the community so

00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,260
people could maybe to know a little bit

00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,640
about what we done there sure is this

00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:42,250
tournament all of the the

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,860
personalization modules have been given

00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,710
back to the community and in fact the

00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:50,970
the lift web back end is only one option

00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:53,770
you could you could use a different

00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:57,340
testing and targeting back end if you so

00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:59,560
chose or you can even use other data

00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:04,180
that you may have about a visitor and

00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,780
pump it in and use those modules any

00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,780
other questions

00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:20,069
yeah it works with varnish this it's all

00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:21,799
done through JavaScript so in

00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:24,869
combination with the varnish cash

00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:27,779
there's JavaScript that has all the

00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:29,029
variations available and that's kind of

00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:32,099
created dynamically on a page-by-page

00:54:29,029 --> 00:54:36,529
basis and then the JavaScript selects

00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:36,529
which variations to to go with

00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,430
yeah there's there's a first party

00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,990
cookie bits stored so if the visitor

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,000
comes back and continues to build a

00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:54,030
profile from exactly where they left off

00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,590
we can also optionally use a third party

00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,660
cookie if you have multiple websites

00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,850
that you operate you want to tie that

00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,910
visitor together across the site's

00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:06,500
notwithstanding any of your privacy

00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,500
policies and other considerations

00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:30,259
we have there's a JavaScript API where

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,469
you can you can actually define any

00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:35,469
event you want and and ingest it into

00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:37,819
the platform so you could create a

00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:40,549
listener that looks at the scroll

00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:42,619
distance and senate event in based on

00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:58,400
that behavior or any other behavior that

00:55:42,619 --> 00:56:01,759
you wish to specifically instrument yeah

00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,940

up a bunch of different attributes you

00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:13,969
could set up attributes like they're

00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:17,239
dependent on you know the present

00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:19,430
session or the next session or you can

00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:23,239
even do kind of time-based criteria in

00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:25,579
