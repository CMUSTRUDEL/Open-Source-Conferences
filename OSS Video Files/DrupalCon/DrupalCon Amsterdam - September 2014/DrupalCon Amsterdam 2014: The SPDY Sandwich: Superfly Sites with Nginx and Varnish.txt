Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: The SPDY Sandwich: Superfly Sites with Nginx and Varnish
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: joe-boperinko
We're all putting in lots of effort to 'make the web faster', and DevOps practitioners are especially interested in using tools to make their sites superfast. Nginx and Varnish are go-to performance tools to make your site fly, but with some cross-over in what they can do, and important capability differences in that cross-over zone, how can you get the best out of them?

This talk will look at using Nginx and Varnish together with SPDY in a 'SPDY sandwich' (Nginx » Varnish » Nginx) to reduce the latency of web pages, and to improve web security. With some overview of the technologies involved, their strengths and benefits, weakenesses and limitations, we'll focus on putting them all together and getting benchmarks for the potential performance paybacks.

The session will cover:

Nginx, I got you (I feel good)
Varnish - Bring it on … Bring it on
Superbad, Superslick, SPDY - What, why, how?
Get on the Good Foot - Everything in SSL/TLS, and encryption ciphers
Get it together - the SPDY sandwich
The Payback - testing it all
Barney Hanlon (@shrikeh) originally proposed the 'SPDY Sandwich'. This session is an in-depth look at set-up and configuration, with special attention given to performance benchmarks.
