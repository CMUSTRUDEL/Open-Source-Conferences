We all want to convince our prospects that Drupal is the best strategic platform for their next project or indeed their entire digital strategy. But getting buy in from every party can be a challenge.

An enterprise sales cycle can be very complex and has many stages, often in parallel. This session focuses on the technical component and how to convince the stakeholders of Drupal’s technical abilities.

Acquia's EMEA Solutions Architects are a group of pre-sale Technical Consultants who position Drupal in the prospect’s digital landscape. We’ll go over our experience and discuss the different steps to get the technical win. We’ll provide examples, tips & tricks and best practices.
