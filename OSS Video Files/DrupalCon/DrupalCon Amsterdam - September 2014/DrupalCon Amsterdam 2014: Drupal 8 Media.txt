Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Drupal 8 Media
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: Dave Reidslashrsm
Every keynote by Dries, and every time a new version of Drupal core is released, one of the biggest features asked for in Drupal 8 is better media handling. There are currently a wide selection of media management solutions for Drupal 7: media, scald, asset, mediabox and more, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

At DrupalCon Prague, the first steps were done towards a unified media solution for Drupal 8 using media entities, while the File Entity and Media maintainers wanted to continue extending core's file entities. At NYCCamp the different teams came together to agree on a common solution forward. This session is the occasion to present our progress so far.

There is also quite a lot of organizational and political questions related to this field and we'll try to present some of those also, including:

Why disagreeing on what entity type to use benefits the solution for end users
The challenges that we foresee when porting and revamping these modules
Where help is necessary still in Drupal 8 to meet those challenges
A call to action to help contribute at the code sprint!
Things we'd like to discuss with the D8 core and contrib developers:

How can we solve contrib library dependencies? We're using Composer for Drupal Core but we also include all of our external libraries in Core itself. Should contrib do the same?
What, if anything should we propose to improve the media handling support for Drupal 8 core before release? What could we include in the 8.x minor releases? What needs to wait for Drupal 9?
What needs have we not considered or need to meet?
