Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Decoupled Front-end and the Future
Publication date: 2014-10-01
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: eatings
For years, front-enders have had an uneasy alliance at best with Drupal, but with the advent of client side Javascript MVC frameworks, the idea of building decoupled/headless Drupal sites has attracted increased interest from all over the community, promising to deliver that ever-elusive unicorn: true and complete control of the presentation layer. Its rapid growth throughout the larger web development universe shows that it is a serious trend to be reckoned with, and a significant indicator of the future of our industry.

But such systems present new difficulties and challenge historical ideals of a monolithic, do-it-all end-to-end CMS solution. Under the decoupled model, our long-held gospel of Drupal's power and flexibility strains to the point of breaking as feature after touted feature falls away -- layout admin tools, contextual information, modules extending or controlling the display of content elements. What does this mean for the engineers (both front and back end), the administrators, and most importantly, the users of such systems?

This session will discuss the following questions:

What does it mean to build truly decoupled apps? How does this fundamentally change the way Drupal sites are architected, developed, and most importantly used?
What do we gain by building such systems? More importantly, what do we lose?
Is Drupal well-suited for such headless systems? Where does it fall short? What does Drupal need to change, and where, to accommodate these uses?
Lastly, and most importantly, what does the Drupal community risk by not embracing this use case and engaging the greater development community pushing it forward?
(This talk was borne from a number of conversations at Drupalcon Austin which led to the formation of the Headless Drupal Working Group)

my name is David Wong this is decoupled

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,460
front end in the future we're going to

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,639
mostly talk about quote-unquote headless

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,230
Drupal it's not going to be a very

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,550
technical talk I mean we're not going to

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,650
be sharing code or like hey use this

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,519
directive here it's going to be mostly

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,109
high-level about you know the

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,449
implications of using and going headless

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,939
the difficulties and or challenges faced

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,760
when going headless and what headless

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,470
actually means and so if you're here

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,390
expecting you know code snippets and how

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,800
to's this might not be the session for

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,599
you but if you wanted to have a

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,480
discussion about the practice of doing

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,760
headless what this entails then you're

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,410
in the right place so this is your your

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,710
last chance I guess to escape and offer

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,780
up your seat to somebody else again d

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,719
couple front end in the future my name

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,010
is David Wong I'm eating's on Twitter I

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,350
don't actually talk very much about

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,760
headless on Twitter so you know there's

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,579
one reason not to follow me I actually

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,020
post a lot of Instagram images I've

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,300
given this talk a number of times

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,710
already to a different audience every

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,239
time I've talked in front of developers

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,530
I've talked in front of designers and

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,480
I've talked in front of JavaScript

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,030
people who you know could give it you

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,400
know two craps about what Drupal was and

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,680
so if I ramble a little bit it's because

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,049
I've tried to make this talk a little

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,909
more inclusive than straight Drupal devs

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,560
talking at each other and I actually

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,700
only have about 20 minutes of slides

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,290
prepared because I'm hoping to hear back

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,259
from you guys I certainly don't feel

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,060
like the end all master or the person

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,119
who knows everything there is to know

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,100
about this particular subject and so the

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,530
microphone there is for questions and

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,880
discussion afterwards I work for a

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,979
company called Acquia as you probably

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,310
noticed by my shirt and this is version

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,290
0.9 of this talk I've given it like I

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,329
said three times already because most

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,520
jobbers get MVC frameworks are like 0.1

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,619
anyway I figured this talk is never

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,149
going to be perfect but if we're here to

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,939
talk about things like that we're okay

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,549
with less imperfection something like

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,619
that so we're here to talk about

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,170
ostensibly quote-unquote headless Drupal

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,369
I actually let's do a first show of

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,140
hands who's heard about the concept

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,409
headless Drupal it this is word means

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,610
something to people okay usually want to

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,369
ask people about headless drupal i

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,130
usually get two reactions i get that or

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,130
that

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,110
no and so you're either super excited

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,050
like yes headless drupal the culmination

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,320
of my dreams or what the hell are you

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,550
talking about and I through this went in

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,120
for my niece's this is her favorite

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,570
movie and as by proximity also mine now

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,010
apparently so what is headless right

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,110
what is headless everybody has an idea

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,700
of what headless is and I think all like

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,520
400 people have joined the headless

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,750
drupal group on geo with a different

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,410
conception of what headless might mean

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,590
for some headless is Drupal as a Content

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,530
model and entity API minus the client

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,030
facing theme layer for some headless

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,910
just means Drupal as a restful

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,440
webservices endpoint for some headless

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,240
means Drupal serving as a Content

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,420
repository for greater system of web

00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,070
properties or web apps for some headless

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,270
simply means bring your own front end I

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,340
want to bring my own front end the

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,560
Drupal more prosaically your app upfront

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,020
Drupal in the back you know whether it

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,030
be another CMS system it need not

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,330
necessarily be JavaScript and just of

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,710
course headless Drupal does also entail

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,660
client-side JavaScript MVC frameworks

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,540
rendering Drupal data and this is the

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,940
popular and the widespread conception of

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,040
what headless is but my point here is

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,270
that headless is a lot more than that

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,130
you can talk to headless at some people

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,640
like build rush rush is headless well

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,950
yeah josh is headless rupal to this is a

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,840
minority of use cases in the wild right

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,840
now of quote-unquote headless screw hole

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,090
the JavaScript MVC framework use case is

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,010
actually a small sliver of this wider

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,290
use case of using Drupal as a services

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,420
endpoint and we'll talk a little bit

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,280
more about this so why would you go with

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,570
headless Drupal why would you not use

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,660
the totality of Drupal why would you

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,310
chop a piece of it off so these are some

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,230
of the things you might get you get

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,930
complete separation of concerns maybe

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,450
Drupal isn't or shouldn't be the

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,280
everything to you you get a triple back

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,690
end and a friend a nap of some kind and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,940
when I befriended I'm being very

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,120
agnostic my friend Annette your iOS app

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,220
your Android app your your other CMS app

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,109
you know Drupal feeding something like a

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,260
pudgy you know all of these are headless

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,910
use cases you can in theory get ultimate

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,580
control of your front-end stack when you

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,110
rip off the

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,300
a bold front end and bring your own

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,490
friend a nap you bring your front end to

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,770
the table it is absolutely yours to a

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,259
hundred percent control and tweak as you

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,759
like and for those of you who are themed

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,520
errs and traditional theme errs of

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,669
Drupal this is a Drupal site this is

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,560
from a demo framework an open source a

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:46,409
demo installation of triple that we use

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,560
quite frequently at aqua um so let's

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,330
take a look oh let's just take this

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,830
image right here 36 hours in Brooklyn

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,199
right it's just an image and a view

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,690
right it's just got a label how hard can

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,330
it be how ugly can tough markup be right

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,159
right and there are people who've been

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,960
railing about this for years I've been

00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,030
doing Drupal 47 of those years and as

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,949
long as I've been in Drupal there's been

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,710
a certain individual let's say the King

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,240
of Denmark who has been railing against

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,250
this sort of thing forever and it's been

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,379
you know he's been pushing that stone up

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,150
that hill for seven years and you know

00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,770
this is triple seven this is after years

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,449
and years of his it was complaining and

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,029
cursing and this is still what we have

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,319
right and at this point I was going to

00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,750
do a more an impression but since he's

00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,710
not in the room I won't but but I trade

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,569
a party and I might do it you you get

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,979
all the power of drupal's content

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,629
modeling tools right we're not taking

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,460
any of that away drupal's content

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,050
modeling drupal's called it authoring

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,029
and workflow all these things that we

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,289
use on the Drupal Chronicle back end you

00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:45,389
know none of this goes away when you

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,710
take away its front end right users

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,080
roles and permissions this is a huge

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,810
pain to to implement on your own like

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,909
you get this for free for free right and

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,409
all the restful serialize entity data

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,659
you can eat right because people just

00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,960
spits that out willy-nilly as easily as

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:02,279
you'd like it to and I wish Jeff eaten

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,620
or somebody like that we're in this room

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,339
right now this value cannot be oversold

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,039
you know like we get there's this Drupal

00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,870
community obsession with with oh you

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,610
know it's Drupal so point-and-click II

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,889
and even outside of the Drupal community

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,000
it's so easy to point and click you know

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,770
it's drupal's for point-and-click

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,629
developers is not for real developers

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,129
but from a Content modeling and

00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:27,150
information architecture and a content

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,979
management for lack of better word

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,469
perspective you know nobody ever said oh

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,199
crap I just point and click my way to a

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:35,460
really robust content model nobody ever

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,960
complains about that right

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,759
like if you want to go and write it and

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,860
extend your own classes may be my guest

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,479
but no point in clicker you can do a lot

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,430
damn worse than creating robust

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,580
relational content models pointing

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,990
clicking wise ah and doing this you know

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,270
using Drupal sis as a service layer i

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,130
mean takes us one step closer to that

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,930
mythical holy grail of right once

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,479
published everywhere right you know like

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,960
this this sort of idea that we're never

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,780
going to be able to write specific bits

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,990
of content we can't keep chasing devices

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,550
and and context as they pop off like we

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,310
have to get a step ahead we have to be

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,020
more agnostic we can't be just okay now

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,699
we got to make an iphone you know view

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,440
what we got to make an ipad view or crap

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,120
now we have to make something to adapt

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,660
for watches we have to be more agnostic

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,250
from the get-go and as a bonus nobody

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,199
says you can't keep your head insights

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,120
either right like you know you can have

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,220
some headless drupal and headed sites

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,720
working side by side or even at the same

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,039
URL if you wanted none of that goes away

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,659
what does go away though other things

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,590
you don't get and this is where it gets

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:42,389
tricky anything that comes from Drupal's

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,039
front end and this depends right i'm

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,870
saying anything right now so let's

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,400
assume that we're doing a fully headless

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,919
side we have cut off the theme layer

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,659
entirely you don't get anything from

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,520
triples front-end Drupal is a data

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,659
service at this point and so all the

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,729
things that you relied upon from

00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,229
drupal's front end from like anything

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,530
that comes from drupal's render pipeline

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,419
oh yeah that's kind of gone um anything

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,150
that involves say drag-and-drop visual

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,940
templating anything that you know allows

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,460
site builders to say oh yeah I want this

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,380
panel here I want this block there oh

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,070
and I want this block there and rendered

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,930
as this display or this view mode yeah

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,130
that's kind of your front-end problem

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,479
now right it's no longer Drupal's

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,919
problem Drupal's not going to give that

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,090
to you right now at least not the way to

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,690
architect it and we'll talk about that

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,940
as well two panels display sweet modules

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,830
any of those drupal components that

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,750
otherwise might inform things like

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,479
display that might help you display

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,180
things that might do it for you without

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,219
you thinking you know these go by the

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,110
wayside you know like it's one of those

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,820
things like you want it's like when you

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,100
divorce your parents at 17 right you

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,910
want emancipation sure but you know

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,220
you're not getting allowance anymore

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,350
front end facing form API form API you

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,100
know welcome to rolling your own form

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,870
API basically anything that comes from

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,610
Drupal's front end and I'm taking a hard

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,520
line here saying that you know what you

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,960
know this is the the Headless Drupal

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,040
that you've heard about maybe they're

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,150
not the headless dribble you've built

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,190
but the headless dribble you've heard

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,870
about you know josh conics talked about

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,750
this a lot and we actually co-presented

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,040
this about a month ago the idea that

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,380
we're going to completely chop off the

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,510
front end now there's degrees to this

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,160
and i'll show you some examples of where

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,510
these degrees can take place like we

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,460
don't have to unilaterally chopped off

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,770
Drupal's front end but if the ultimate

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,020
goal is to have complete independence of

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,280
front-end and back-end these are some of

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,720
the implications that we have to live

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,330
with at least for now and these are not

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,920
trivial hurdles I wanted to re-emphasize

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,750
this like this is not something you go

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,790
in and say damn it I'm going to do it

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,560
you know and screw it this is going to

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,900
be easy and these frameworks make all

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,810
this work easy because it can't be

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,700
overstated how much of your customers of

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,920
your clients of the people who end up

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,210
using your Drupal sites who aren't

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,100
necessarily developing your Drupal sites

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,410
rely on these functionalities or I've

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,810
come to accept Drupal as that thing that

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,880
provides that functionality you know for

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,980
years and years and years we've sold and

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,690
we've built and we evangelize Drupal as

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,000
this particular thing that'll give you

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,520
all these features and all these

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,190
functionalities and now comes along in

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,080
the last year practice that says yes we

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,000
will make our front-end developers lives

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,220
easier we're going to embrace these new

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,280
technologies we are going to draw the

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,360
line here for our developers and what I

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,740
haven't really seen as much of a

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,660
conversation around but what are the

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,220
implications for the users of these

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
sites what is it what are the

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,400
implications for the perception of

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,710
Drupal at large you know what does this

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,540
mean about what's drupal's role in all

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,460
of this because it is changing and the

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,460
changes i just talked about are huge

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,690
they're not trivial and that sort of

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,550
discussion sort of fallen by the wayside

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,050
it gets a little you know sweep swept

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,370
under the rug like oh yeah you know like

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,750
well that's just something we just have

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,850
to accept when we go down this route

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,830
well I don't think all parties involved

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,480
have really considered what going down

00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,130
this route means I think we've talked a

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,800
great length about the technological

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,700
benefits but you know how this changes

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,340
drupal's position

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,680
nning to clients to users to site

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,610
builders is tremendous and it's

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,860
something that I would like to talk

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,300
about today and all this comes down to

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,520
the fact that Drupal steam system within

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,980
Drupal itself is privileged right drupal

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,020
steam system has access to things that

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,460
the services layer right now in triple

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,380
does not or at least does not easily

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,610
have so why in the world would we even

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,080
do this thing you know after we talked

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,120
about like the pluses of the minuses why

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,530
would one want to do this and there are

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,150
compelling reasons for why would one

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,350
ought to do this I asked this before I

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,760
mean I was getting how many people in

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,560
here identify his friend and developers

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,500
docomo and so about half okay great um

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,740
the truth is front-end moves fast it

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,190
moves really fast it moves way faster

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,650
than Drupal Drupal contributor poke or

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,230
front end it you know Drupal is always

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,480
chasing the innovations in front end and

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,000
I've said this in two talks already and

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,610
I this is something that I feel very

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,470
strongly that front Drupal is not a

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,360
front-end trend Center it is definitely

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,310
a follower and sometimes a fast follower

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,950
but it's never a trendsetter and we're

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,690
always more or less at the agenda of

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,250
other forces when it comes to

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,680
integrating things to the Drupal

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,810
front-end separating a front-end layer

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,240
from Drupal allows it to move

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,650
independently of Drupal itself and so

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
the dependencies upon drupal and

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,570
drupal's the drupal pace car let's say

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,730
you know we can you know take the fast

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,160
lane and move around in it'll allow

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,230
front-end to move at innovation speed

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,970
and like drupal and the content model

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,640
which hopefully aren't changing as fast

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,350
as your friend and technologies move at

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,090
its own pace your content model your

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,570
site when you build it it has its own

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,950
speed as well the Drupal core moves at

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,860
its own speed dribble contributor zone

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,480
speed your site's data model has its own

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,580
pace which might be faster or slower

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,230
than Drupal and your front-end you

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,940
fronted technologies that the things

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,740
that you want to leverage from a

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,130
technology perspective they have their

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,120
own pace as well and it's sort of i

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,560
think it's been described as the

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,300
Goldilocks solution i think by the four

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,490
kitchens guys that everybody gets to use

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,170
the tools that they like and move with

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,330
the speed that they like front end

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,790
developers aren't hand shackle to the

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,700
limitations of drupal's markup or speed

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,250
or its ability to innovate

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,500
your content creators your content

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,540
modelers and your information architects

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,790
get to use the same Drupal goodies that

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,670
they've known since forever and are

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,440
familiar with and your your developers

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,260
who develop in Drupal get to keep the

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,940
Drupal parts that they like and this all

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,310
goes back at least for me to the reset

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,930
the lesson of the responsive web which

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,340
is we can't predict the next big change

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,470
at least on the front end you know the

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,980
responsive web came and completely shook

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:47,340
web development to its core even my

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,690
coats seminal article on responsive web

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,190
the one with the the black-and-white

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,410
images on the list apart if you guys

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,100
remember seeing that came out a couple

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,700
months after Drupal 7 went official one

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,460
point 0 and it was not a thing until

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,680
then and drupal 7 was shipped basically

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,840
in ignorance of this trend that suddenly

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,580
came blew up the the front-end

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,620
development space and changed our work

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,130
as find ender's forever essentially for

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,050
the last four years and what are we

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,880
doing in Drupal 8 to anticipate or

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,240
accommodate the next earth-shattering

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,850
change that comes in front of us um as

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,220
an aside I want to point out that Drupal

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,870
has two heads Drupal is actually a

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,060
two-headed beast there is the admin

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,950
interface that has a head and there's

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,650
the customer facing you know your public

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,210
theme that's also a head right now I've

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,730
really only talked about cutting off one

00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,740
of them but we'll also talk about

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,120
cutting off the other one so let me give

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,950
you a couple examples of sites that I'm

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,900
talking about who are at least in some

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,490
way headless and maybe not headless in

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,380
the way you're thinking but are truly

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,600
headless it when you when you think

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,790
about the the larger taxonomy of what it

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,620
means to be headless a Drupal site for

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,110
example feeding mobile apps right now

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,390
this is a headless site there's content

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,030
that's being pushed to a device that has

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,920
no it doesn't care what the what the end

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,330
point is that it's pulling data from on

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,330
your mobile device this is a headless

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,700
Drupal site this is Common Sense Media I

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,590
used to work for them they have a common

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,970
sense media or do they have native

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,250
mobile labs that are pulling data

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,230
directly from the Drupal website and

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,450
spitting it out onto the common sense

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,090
media app they're feeding data to set

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,670
top boxes they have api's that they're

00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,300
monetizing this is in many ways headless

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,310
Drupal right you know the comcast

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,470
fox that's pulling data out of this

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:36,220
triple website it's a headless drupal

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,500
instance there's an unnamed client a

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,690
drupal content is Drupal is being used

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,670
for content modeling for narrative data

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,710
it's plugging into this massive online

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,080
retail system that's fronted by angular

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,020
so this yellow box imagine is its ERP

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,970
system it's blue box is Drupal and this

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,130
green box is you know whatever system

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,300
that Drupal is also referencing and all

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,950
this is being combined and mashed

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,510
together and shoved into this one web

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,270
app at the top which is powered by

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,710
angular which is pulling its data from

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,650
multiple sources so in this case it's

00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,750
not even headless Drupal its angular

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,760
wrapping a constellation of systems

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,580
underneath it of which Drupal is only a

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,220
small part headless Drupal can also be

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,140
let's say if you have a Drupal site that

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,270
is pushing content to other Drupal end

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,370
points that have a public face but this

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,870
original silo does not so for example

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,340
you have an authoring environment that's

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,650
pushing content to multiple endpoints

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,680
this is an away headless Drupal as well

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,570
and then sort of the Holy Grail at least

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,520
from a front-end developer is that you

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,470
have a Drupal site that is completely

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,840
separated where you have swappable

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,300
front-end teams techniques and systems

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,980
and you have this Drupal base that's

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,680
consistent so let's say you know you

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,630
have a Drupal base of a large site you

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,520
want to build the front end of ember one

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,200
day you're going to have even have

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,610
another team build it out of angular you

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,870
have another team that's building it out

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,940
of I don't know react or whatever I

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,970
shouldn't be naming all JavaScript but

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,850
the same idea that you can build sites

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,350
with a consistent Drupal back end but

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,910
but the front end be whatever you want

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,110
you know as needed and the last thing um

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,760
and I don't have this is not very well

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,110
thought out but but this is I know it's

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,730
kind of a thing you know there's this

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,740
talk about the Internet of Things and it

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,870
comes back to this notion of being

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,470
prepared for the next big thing and

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,180
being moving beyond this idea that

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,740
Drupal has to own everything and to end

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,420
and predict everything and that we have

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,370
to keep bending Drupal the Internet of

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,800
Things Schmidt a ton of things I'm 34

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,970
years old and I'm already seen enough of

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,560
the Internet where I'm like I don't know

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,250
if things whatever you know let the kids

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,630
have it right I don't even have kids yet

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,270
but i think the the

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,280
propositions offered there are valid you

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,200
know like drupal content on non-web

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,250
devices creases talked about this I

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,990
think everybody here at least has one

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,960
non-web device that might have a browser

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,450
that you know you you know drupal

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,700
reading in my kindle okay one who really

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,500
wants to do that you know iiii think

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,540
being dismissive of new technology

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,310
before it really emerges is a fool's

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,810
errand and i think that if we were going

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,860
to dismiss things like the internet of

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,480
things out of hand before they really

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,010
have a chance to explode we're going to

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,710
look like idiots in the end if we don't

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,900
you know bet correctly and I don't feel

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,840
like we're like betting against it is a

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,110
good deal so and this is where I get

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,430
kind of out of there what if i want

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,530
preface this by larry garfield the guy

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,600
in the vest in the middle came up said

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,100
yesterday that Drupal's admin UI doesn't

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,590
really have api so much as it has

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,540
buttons with DB calls mapped to them and

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,120
this goes like to the idea that drupal

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,950
theme system and Drupal's admin our

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,440
previous privileged systems within

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,170
drupal itself like they have access to

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,290
AP is the no other system in drupal do

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,300
and so the idea of making a completely

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,830
decoupled but for you know equivalent

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,450
front end is difficult is because we

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,940
have an architecture like this right now

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,010
but what if all drupal finance were

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,500
decoupled service based apps including

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,870
the ones that ship with core what your

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,880
what if the admin if seven theme were

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,380
actually seven dot app and it would say

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,670
a backbone app or you can swap it out

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,960
with an ember app we can swap it out

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,680
with whatever the hell kind of app you

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,320
want it you know it versus the the twig

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,240
theme system you know what if we could

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,980
do that what if drupal woods built like

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,380
that from the get-go such that these

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,620
systems could be equivalent to what come

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,400
with core um and that that's a bit of my

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,400
challenge oh no

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,779
okay well like the Pantheon side oh it's

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,990
because I work for you that's fun huh

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,820
and so that's my challenge you know and

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,890
I've had conversations people like what

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,510
if this could be possible what if this

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,669
is the way trooper was built or at least

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,529
a very viable option what if this wasn't

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,450
something that didn't take a tremendous

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,970
amount of work like it does now and

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,679
wasn't full of compromise you know but

00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,330
what if we everything including drupal's

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,409
native front end started on the same

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,700
foot as everything else and this is the

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:07,070
little coda and this is my little

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,510
wrap-up I don't have like a punishing or

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,860
a dry phone message but Drupal has four

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,929
words existent tried to be all things to

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,570
everybody it's an all-in-one soup to

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,980
nuts drupal shaped hammer everything can

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,770
be solved in Drupal Drupal wants to

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,830
solve your complete web problem from the

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,320
moment you want to enter content to the

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,970
last bit of CSS that you render you

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:34,070
build the app oh sorry that's exciting

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,049
you bend the app to Drupal you build the

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,909
use case around Drupal and you live and

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:43,399
die by the entire stack until now

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:46,730
everything from your hello there we go

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:49,490
presentation content data model all

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:52,250
three layers are done in Drupal and are

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,990
expected to be handled by drupal but

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,640
what if Drupal is just another layer in

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,559
your stack and didn't have to own all of

00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,299
it and you could swap out any piece

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:04,010
freely at any time for any other

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:05,779
technology that you wanted and so my

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,029
argument at least is by decoupling the

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,460
front end we make Drupal as a system

00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:13,809
more flexible more useful more relevant

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,890
to developers in the world than less and

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,020
there's this analogy that Josh

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,630
co-accused and I really love it there's

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,929
a big Venn diagram of Drupal developers

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,309
and this other circle is skilled

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,500
front-end developers and the

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,690
intersection of the two is so narrow as

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,760
to be almost a line or maybe a dot and

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,590
that there's a universe of development

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,240
and work that's going on that's kind of

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,429
outside the purview of Drupal and we're

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,080
not leveraging it whatsoever and if we

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,789
could bring those two circles more

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,789
closely into alignment even by a

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:45,239
fraction

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:47,909
we would introduce so much more fresh

00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,470
blood ideas vitality and developers into

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:52,950
the into our ecosystem than we have

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:58,379
right now and mr. Spock agrees with me

00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:01,259
so um so so these resources have changed

00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:02,549
a little bit there's a headless Drupal

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,989
working group which is kind of like a

00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,059
bizarre of people throwing out their

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,220
ideas and there's not really any focus

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,869
and actually part of the that come the

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,830
reason I pitches conversation news to

00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,509
bring a little more focused through the

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,220
discussion so that we have something to

00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:16,499
work something towards I know amitai is

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,229
giving a talk later today about his work

00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:20,849
with Drupal 7 and and and headless and

00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:22,710
his interpretations of how Hitler should

00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:24,659
go I would highly recommend going to

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,200
that too he likes to talk as much as I

00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,179
do which is great and I'm David I

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,739
meetings on twitter feel free to berate

00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:36,299
me on the internets and I want to have a

00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,830
conversation here these are all the

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,239
slides i have but i was told by

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,830
Stephanie that I must have this slide on

00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:44,279
here so you can cast that judgments

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:49,139
economy and and rain and rain them down

00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:51,599
like blood from the sky but i dont clap

00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:53,429
clapping when it's over um i would love

00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,119
to hear people's thoughts on this at the

00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:58,859
microphone and if you i know it's going

00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,470
to be difficult but if we could try

00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,460
doing going to the mic and if not if

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,289
that's not gonna happen I'll just repeat

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:10,009
it alright stripe shirt alright shot low

00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,009
chop yeah

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,980
what we need is like a really a boom mic

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,040
right you know and like with a big fuzzy

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:37,970
you know like a TV show I'll just repeat

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:40,460
your question sure okay right right how

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:44,140
do we sit versus other CMS's that have

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,140
similar systems I'm glad you asked

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,460
repressed has a some stuff going on

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,559
that's very interesting WordPress has oh

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,160
you can't see it ha this is on my screen

00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,559
okay here we go everybody WordPress has

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,130
something called client J dash Jes which

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,500
is a reference backbone app wrapping the

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,900
WordPress JSON API so this is a

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,450
reference app that they've built for

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,990
other developers to copy and to look at

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:18,559
I know I think it's is a type of three

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:20,510
it's one of the major European CMS's is

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,190
working towards fundamentally

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,260
transitioning their architecture such

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,929
that their admin experience is a

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,900
services based architecture and so is it

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,220
type of three okay I mean it's not

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,510
shipped yet but it's something that

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,390
they're actively there's an initiative

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,070
there to bring that to light and so the

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,990
at least word there's simply there's

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,120
WordPress there's type of three there's

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,679
others they're granted all of this is

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,210
very much the cutting edge right like

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,160
I'm not selling the alarm after the

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,500
houses burned down like there's an ember

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,440
but you know the fire has not consumed

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,020
us all yet but what I would like to do

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,570
is at least get in front of this problem

00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,920
and not wait until Drupal 92 seriously

00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,870
have this conversation you know like

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,940
during you know Drupal 8 has introduced

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,350
all this great change in decoupling

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,390
systems that we previously thought with

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,800
monolithic and we've broken things apart

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,200
architectural II at least on the back

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,510
end and I mean the very very back end

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,490
not like the 7 theme but like the

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:17,240
system's underlying it that allow for

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:19,970
much more plug ability and decomposition

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,220
is that the right word ya digg

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,380
decomposition of components underneath

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,720
drupal that allow at least in theory

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,549
swap ability where there was none before

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,230
and I would like to see a similar level

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:35,169
of effort expended for the front end

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,169
such that we can do similar things there

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:42,830
I'll come back to you it out of people

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:45,409
underground scenario where a client

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,960
would come to us and they have a d7 site

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:51,110
and they're really looking for a front

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,750
end refresh their content model is

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,490
already fine generally speaking across

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,590
the board he'll the content doesn't need

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,929
to be changed however they're looking

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:04,400
for a sec refresh your thoughts around

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:08,720
taking existing d7 site and moving it to

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,940
a headless Drupal stack where we really

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:18,890
concentrate only on the front end the

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:20,870
bottle so the question asked was client

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,700
wants to refresh their d7 site where the

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,140
content model is satisfactory to them

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,049
but they want to have a front-end

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,580
refresh that may be more than just CSS

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,970
how would headless you know how would

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:37,010
headless you could use case with this

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:39,049
right right no and that's one that

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,990
that's a good point there is no clear

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,700
and obvious and or recommend a way to do

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,130
this right now everybody implements from

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,130
scratch go ahead yeah

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,159
so did that for the people on the TV who

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,940
watched us next week it's a solstice

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,380
project on github an angular wrapper for

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,630
solar as an intermediary of Drupal sites

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,549
did you want Larry's actually going to

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,950
step up to the mic while following the

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,630
rules that's why I took a seat on the

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,230
aisle here so I could do that job good

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:50,169
job so one of the challenges to what

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,510
you're describing is an awful lot of

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,940
Drupal's power and flexibility comes

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:59,230
from that tight coupling that and the

00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,029
fact that you know you have render

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,980
arrays that are modified by a

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,389
configuration that is embedded within a

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,549
piece of content that controls the

00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:08,110
display that's how you get panel Iser

00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,590
that's how you can't even do that kind

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,260
of thing if you have you know a fully

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,500
decoupled front-end and back-end you

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,179
lose a ton of that flexibility because

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,980
everything is a lot more coarse grained

00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,210
and if you made it as fine grain that is

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,840
now than you haven't actually decouple

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,710
down it right right so I'm not going to

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,149
say we shouldn't do it for that reason

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,580
I'm actually going to say we desperately

00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:33,789
need to do it but how do we make the

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,279
argument that it's okay to lose per

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,230
element cash capabilities like we have

00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,210
now with render cashing in the name of

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,399
this kind of decoupling how do we make

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,870
that case that certain things will break

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,200
and not be possible if we don't

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,620
privilege one theme system over another

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,940
how do we make that argument I think and

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,320
this may not solve the problem but the

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,549
way I'd envisioned it always is that

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,350
there would be III don't want to open up

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,210
the universe for any and all possible

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,620
front ends but I think an acceptable

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,630
compromise that would get us a lot more

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,409
forward don't move us a lot more forward

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,120
is to have a reference angular

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,950
implementation that maybe is tightly

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,299
coupled to Drupal a reference backbone

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,159
implementation that may be tightly

00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,659
coupled to Drupal that Drupal is making

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,340
assumptions about this front end to a

00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:21,580
certain degree that would allow that

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,470
kind of privilege coupling and then that

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,330
you know we can at least build an

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,279
angular lab it might not be any anger

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,060
app but it might be you know we might be

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,640
able to

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,050
for lack of a better descriptor you know

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,290
something like something this this

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,450
angular app to build angular apps off of

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,680
it won't be a blank slate one but it

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,760
would make certain assumptions about

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,500
Drupal and Drupal will make certain

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,050
assumptions about it and that we would

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,310
have instead of just being tightly

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,140
coupled to twig in the rendering raised

00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,520
and the drupal theme system we would

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,240
have at least multiple options at that

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:56,230
point so if I could continue on that

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,370
yeah so you're not as much saying don't

00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,680
have her privileged front end does have

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,300
multiple privileged front ends I guess I

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,830
would saying I can see multiple

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,490
privileged findings is better than just

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,620
one and or a highly d privileged one and

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,290
I get what you're saying I don't think

00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,240
it's actually feasible because you know

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,160
the power of having everything in memory

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,470
together in PHP is where that coupling

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,990
and power comes from there's just things

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,480
that if there's a depth that an angular

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,240
app will never get and there's a depth

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,890
that a front-end built with cylex or

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,230
symphony that's talking to Drupal over

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,960
rest behind the scenes and self-serving

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,730
pages is never going to get that unless

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,080
it has render arrays spidering through

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,490
it now I'd love to get rid of those all

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,250
those render arrays I'm actually asking

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,230
you please help me make this argument to

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,370
fully break these things apart but how

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,090
do we make that argument that there's

00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:47,650
some level of easy flexibility that we

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,580
lose when we break things apart and

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:58,720
simplify them that way I don't know the

00:30:51,580 --> 00:31:00,190
answer I am throwing that out so but

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,320
while we marinated these questions out

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,920
anyone else please don't please anybody

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,810
who glasses please step to the mic sorry

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,549
I don't know what it's the same man fair

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:13,149
enough yeah

00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:16,049
and so yeah I mean I don't have the

00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:19,690
answer either but I think that it might

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:21,700
make sense to like talk about specific

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,679
Drupal versions now that we have the

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,919
beta out and everything right I mean and

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,570
think of it as separate problems I mean

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,570
yes we want to solve that particular

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,480
issue interval 7 you know I also think

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,489
that it might make sense to to talk

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,590
about these issues like making you know

00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:41,350
as you said you don't have access to

00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,639
form API and you don't have access to

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,320
the output from the field for matters

00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,970
and so on so maybe think about these

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,590
problems separately and try to solve

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,720
each of these cases separately and as

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,759
you know as much as you as you can and

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,580
achieve as much as you can but break

00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,499
them into separate problems instead of

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,600
thinking it thinking of it as you know

00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:03,600
at one big giant your issue

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,010
I'm big on open data and governance so

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,260
wouldn't it be interesting for drupal to

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:17,560
be like the headliner for every single

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:20,440
government to publish their data as an

00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,620
JSON format together with their sites in

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,020
cooperation and that way just push

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,600
Drupal to more and more government sites

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,490
try to promote it and actually fill in a

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,770
giant giant gap we have right now

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,720
because a lot of governments just don't

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,640
go for big data because it's a lot of

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,850
tough stuff to actually deal with right

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,320
now they have to actually redo most of

00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,930
their stuff because they can't just do

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,180
it with bathrooms are using and if we

00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:48,880
can them in one way or another proposed

00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,410
like yes which the Drupal and it's

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,560
basically with a click of a button and

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:55,570
you just publish JSON data next to your

00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,370
current like your current front that

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,200
without changing anything would that be

00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,980
an interesting idea to actually promote

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,050
and work with yeah depends on the

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,490
government yeah obviously you have the

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,770
thing is let's your North Korea we love

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,270
that yeah but like Belgium is pretty big

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,210
on it right now they're trying to

00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,710
promote open data but there's not a lot

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,970
of government of all internal

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,580
governments doing it because there's

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,680
actually the biggest issue is they have

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:24,010
the current sites are using do not

00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,110
support open data in one way or no way

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,700
and the thing is no Drupal 8 support for

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,680
services is much better than seven out

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,940
of the box right and then this is almost

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,530
like a talking point at this point about

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
triple date loko you get the rest module

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,150
and it's actually kind of nice to have

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,520
it built in the the question isn't that

00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,460
the rest is rest going to be strong

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,530
enough in d 8 it's what are we getting

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,810
out of rest and how can we make that

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,850
more robust for the needs of a fully

00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,190
baked app like this you know like we can

00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,690
get data out of drupal just fine now the

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,120
question about governance like that is

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,590
just its governance of the government

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,910
you know it's getting clients on board

00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,590
with hey let's expose some of this data

00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,230
because Drupal can't do it and fairly

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,850
trivial e2 at that at this point we want

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,410
to make it more robust such that we can

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,169
build better apps around it than just

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:14,240
simply querying no data let's say okay

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:16,010
all right who wants to step up good

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,100
okay i'll repeat your question that's

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,100
fine

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:51,710
so oh that's hard to summarize um so i

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:54,319
think if i hearing you correctly you to

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,450
take a page from the the single page app

00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:58,670
model where you know your lots and lots

00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,799
of java chip calls as needed pulling in

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,930
data you know just in time and then

00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:07,160
rendering it as needed yes sort of okay

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:16,720
we've got to fix this Mike situation

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:19,309
yeah shivers reply Larry conversation I

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,510
guess the implication of that then I

00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,210
think that goes back to the date was

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,150
talking about before that means no

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,640
panels nope analyzer no display sweets

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,890
no field for matters you have

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,020
reimplement all of that in your angular

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:38,750
app does anyone actually want to do that

00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:40,309
I'm not volunteering but how do we you

00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,740
know how do we have that capability

00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:44,390
without having that you know you're

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,000
configuring the formatter as part of the

00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,000
note decode

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,940
sure liked Bob Barker carrying that

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,730
Thanks so like if you if you manage to

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:31,400
share the data that you clicked in any

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,130
of these modules I display suit you can

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,550
you could use it in energy escape up to

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,410
to render whatever you need and that way

00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,780
like you wouldn't take everything away

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,630
just the half of it or some part of it

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,340
so and do it again yes so you're saying

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,020
you're still reimplemented your for

00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,230
matter but your formatter configuration

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,300
can still be on the server yes one day

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,120
be so one of the things that that Jesse

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,410
patient co-read him and I talked about

00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,610
and I feel like I'm sort of channeling

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,260
and speaking for them as well because

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,060
they couldn't be here we talked about

00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,280
this in Austin is uh has anybody seen

00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:10,190
Carly burns talk about writing a new

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,420
render pipeline Oh Larry sorry you're

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,890
like that so normally it's more in

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,760
that's trolling me doing my talks and so

00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,460
you're taking morons place okay there we

00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,920
go so carl wieman had proposed this new

00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,960
object oriented render pipeline which

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,110
was like okay yeah yeah and then in the

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,120
end he was able to address by fragment

00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:33,320
and tired rendered sections of pages of

00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:36,710
nodes by URL and so you know give me

00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:41,180
this URL of this region this block down

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:43,310
to this field rendered in JSON and when

00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,280
both Jesse and I saw this not to be too

00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,510
much for them it was just kind of

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,310
eye-opening like wow why can't we have

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,780
that all the time like we're getting

00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:55,790
kind of the best of both worlds we're

00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:57,620
getting Drupal rendered objects in JSON

00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,390
addressable by URL that we can

00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,850
predictably call again and again and

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:04,160
again and these can be fragments of an

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,830
entire rendered page and so you know

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,850
Drupal is informing so the fundamental

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,120
problem that we're talking about here

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,200
that

00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,730
Larry's bringing up is that there's no

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,950
way in the current services baked

00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:16,040
architecture that you can build a drupal

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:18,470
site easily or without tremendous pain

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,020
that allows the author to both express

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,640
content and intent for that content and

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,950
so if the author has an idea of like

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,410
this needs to be a sidebar and this

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,900
needs to be you know rendered as a blah

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,130
blah blah on this different side there

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,290
isn't a reliable way to do this right

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,150
now via our services API because you're

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,590
just going to bring back a node you know

00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,910
unrendered a via via our JSON API and

00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,620
then you're going to have to decide what

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,600
to do with it once you get to the

00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,190
angular side and angular might not know

00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,380
anything about you know how Drupal might

00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,960
render it you know via plugins or via

00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,670
via panels or you know what have you and

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,180
so that that's part of the way there and

00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:00,680
I feel like this this sort of space here

00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,850
what we're trying to get Drupal to be

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,800
all things to all people but in a

00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,840
different way than it has been before is

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,610
this weird place where Jeff eaten gets

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,990
on board and people like Jesse get on

00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,210
board people like myself get on board

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,290
where the content strategists are trying

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:18,830
to build a more contact context and

00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:20,240
device less sensitive Drupal Drupal that

00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,670
that's more Universal that isn't built

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,130
for just desktops or just built for HTML

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,620
or just built for responsive websites

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,820
you know the genes of the world and then

00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,110
there's like the front-end engineers of

00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,930
the world who want to use tools like

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,190
Amber and and angular and react and you

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,590
know whatever the hell new frame becomes

00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,300
out tomorrow because it's better tooling

00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,370
it's more fun to do and it's a damn

00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,290
sight better than drupal theme layer and

00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,260
then there's the third which I guess I

00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:49,190
sort of fall into where I I don't want

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,330
Drupal to stay it the current ripple

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,920
models getting a little long in the

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,500
tooth and it's hard to defend against

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,450
other products that might do certain

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,850
things better Drupal as a whole might do

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,980
all of it better but that we ignore

00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,230
certain innovations in areas front end

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,970
or otherwise is at our own peril because

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,770
that's where talent and interest and

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,330
attention are going and we want to be

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,950
able to capture least some of that or at

00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,230
least be relevant in those conversations

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,850
because if we don't then it's just be

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,340
eligible that's a site to use to make

00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,340
your complex web site not much else

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:41,180
oh ya know what right note that that's

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,290
absolutely possible so that there are

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,630
people who are building angular

00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,220
components into their drupal websites or

00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,680
Drupal is rendering a page and then as

00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,230
one of your panel blocks or panel pains

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,880
is an angular widget of some kind you

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:56,060
know like this this is the if you look

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,950
at Austin Sally Sally young to talk

00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,260
about i think it was MSNBC and they're

00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,510
using that technique angular embedded

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,670
within drupal as a portion if not the

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,050
majority of a display there's also

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,060
people you know like common sense media

00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,880
like I gave before where they have a

00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,110
headed website regular plain old Drupal

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,880
that you would make right and then a

00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:16,400
separate stack that mirrors that from a

00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,320
data level but it's just an API endpoint

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,330
and all their API stuff based off

00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,160
whether it be iphone apps you know

00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,500
comcast set-top boxes whatever I'll talk

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,550
to that so there's that as well I mean

00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,300
that's what people are doing currently

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:32,390
the goal is for DS da door deep a point

00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,130
X or whatever to not have to jump

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,260
through hurdles to not have to write all

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,550
this services stuff to not have to

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:42,290
sacrifice as much as we're sacrificing

00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:43,910
as I described so that these alternative

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,950
front ends can be if not first-class

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,330
citizens at least not sitting you know

00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:51,650
essentially in the bathroom in the tail

00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:58,000
where they are right now stripes right

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:58,000
again does mike this mike come on down

00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:06,050
hey um talking about javascript

00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,730
libraries and frameworks that might sit

00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,080
on top specifically for a minute and

00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:13,330
forgetting the other options that you'd

00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,680
be the head yeah in your experience and

00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:18,410
from feedback you've received so far

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,670
case studies you've heard do you think

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,770
there are any libraries that are a

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,140
better fit than others for whatever

00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,480
reason bit community technically

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,550
whatever for this kind of implementation

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,630
with Drupal or is it literally just it's

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,160
a free-for-all I think it's a

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,150
free-for-all I think you ask three

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,400
different front-end developers they'll

00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:38,300
get three different answers I think the

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,100
technologies are so new and the changes

00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,380
the differences between them are so

00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,970
opinionated that it really is just

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,119
almost religious now at this point you

00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,450
know like is Android

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,859
I feel better right let's not answer it

00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,450
from the cory doctorow sense but look

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,009
from a you know a usability sense you

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,339
know is your android iphone better you

00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:57,059
know it you asked three different

00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:59,480
developers i'll tell you through

00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,480
different things

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
mm-hmm

00:43:52,119 --> 00:44:03,560
so the question is if right yeah yeah so

00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,170
the question is will the complexity of

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,400
allowing multiple client heads to a

00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:12,740
triple site in the future lead to

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,090
overwhelming or increasing workload and

00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,210
or complexity of projects I actually

00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,770
think it I think in the long run it

00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,900
actually reduced complexity in that you

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,880
can just weaken that Drupal site that

00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,010
you're building a head on top of May

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,200
last six years seven years doesn't

00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,030
change right or changes slightly right

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,010
and you can swap out that front end as

00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,600
you want you can swap out the vendor

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,369
that provides that front end as you want

00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,900
you've your vendor that specializes in a

00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,580
particular JavaScript skill set but

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,860
knows nothing about Drupal they can

00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,720
still write a robust app on top of your

00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,520
Drupal site right and somebody comes in

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,900
as long as you're as long as your your

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,910
API is well documented I mean people

00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,740
have been writing web apps on top of

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,740
robust api's for you know decades now

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,380
sure right well that's true and I'm not

00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,820
saying we should get rid of the HTML

00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,470
front end anyway i'm not i'm not saying

00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,570
cut off Drupal's existing had you know

00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,100
I'm altima tlie saying it'll give the

00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,930
option of either popping that one off

00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,450
and like a lego man put the one with the

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,520
red face on versus the yellow face or

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,320
alternatively have multiple heads you

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,470
know in an array on top of your

00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,090
shoulders each with different colors

00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,850
there's nothing that will prove nothing

00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:29,550
I've proposing is saying let's lose

00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,920
Drupal's current ability that's publish

00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,180
straight to HTML I'm never going to

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,760
propose that i'm not saying Drupal

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:39,110
should only be a back-end architecture

00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,110
never that's never a goal

00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:54,270
well I don't think that's necessarily

00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:55,920
true I I think having more options when

00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,660
it comes to publishing given the

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,910
proliferation of the context that our

00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,500
content is expected to be on is only a

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,320
good thing like limiting ourselves the

00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,850
HTML I think is a fond is finally

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,520
looking at my shoulder into a past when

00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,140
web development was more simple I think

00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:14,070
we should embrace complexity we should

00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:23,460
embrace innovation and not pretend like

00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:25,500
it's not going to catch up to us so I've

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,990
heard a lot of talk about these swapping

00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,020
out of front-end and front-end systems

00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:33,150
being highly opinionated how do you do

00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,150
you see these front end systems being

00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:38,820
contributed back how do you see this is

00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:41,070
impacting contribution are they going to

00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,470
be so opinionated and so specific to the

00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:46,080
content model as to be unable to be

00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:49,350
contributed back to the community wow

00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,580
that's a hard question um I in this

00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,680
perfect world that I've envisioned right

00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,530
that is a very fully version it's more

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,290
like a remember dream than anything else

00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:01,260
we would have reference apps like it let

00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,330
you know for each of several front ends

00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,740
and that these apps would be general

00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,300
enough that you know like like the

00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,950
weight how base teams are I mean base

00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,610
teams are really opinionated you know

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,980
omega 3 vs zen versus you know versus

00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,710
aurora versus what's another opinion a

00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,700
one adaptive theme your mothership right

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,410
you know all of these have strong

00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,850
opinions and people in Drupal have

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,930
managed to get along with those just

00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,370
fine right you know they might have

00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,530
arguments in the hallways or say you

00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,630
know your system sucks whatever but

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:30,180
sites get stood up all the same I don't

00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,560
see that model changing for something as

00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,570
you know swapping out a front end

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:37,230
whether it be you know this JavaScript

00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:38,820
framework or another front of news by

00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,530
our by Nature I think very opinionated

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,870
or at least the opinionated ones end up

00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:49,490
speaking and that propagates more

00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:49,490
opinions you know and so yeah please

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:59,000
just wanted to make a note about the the

00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:01,490
content writers so it's really important

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,200
to to realize that when we go decoupled

00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:08,480
that the administration experience in

00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,570
the content model is far different so

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,660
it's not page centric it's it's much

00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:17,420
more agnostic to the end point so the

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:21,080
difficulty in that is the way in which

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,300
content is is written and stored doesn't

00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,810
really allow for preview and also

00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:31,130
requires a different thought process as

00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:32,630
to how to create that content so that's

00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,200
something that's really important so I

00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:38,450
think for this to work first of all it

00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,790
needs a particular type of organization

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:42,500
and a certain level of complexity

00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:44,990
overall that I don't think this is a

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,240
hobbyist oh no right by no means right

00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,750
this is yeah there's more of a larger

00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,610
structured organization direction and

00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,410
also the content model will likely still

00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:57,230
have to have some sort of a page centric

00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,640
option for cases where you were you're

00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:01,610
explaining that you know the author

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,130
wants to have that right sidebar they

00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,290
want to have that that sentence so it's

00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,420
probably the solution is some sort of a

00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,970
blended approach to structure content

00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:14,090
that's completely decoupled from the

00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:16,070
endpoint and page centric content

00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:22,670
modeling and you know how that gets

00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:25,610
divided on that point what it says those

00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,560
editors are going to be incapable of

00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:30,410
previewing the content to all the

00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,940
endpoints that it flows period so it has

00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:34,250
to be important is to identify where

00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,590
their concerns lie does that person

00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,940
really care about the mobile experience

00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,620
for their users too or is it just that

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,410
they really care when they're

00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,090
compositing the day's editorial for the

00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,000
splash page on the homepage of the site

00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,800
and and so it's it's with anything it's

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,350
about identifying where the concerns lie

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,210
from the stakeholders point of view but

00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,260
I think what's being proposed is why I'm

00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,150
trying to think about how to deal with

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,050
the fact that we are in a multi-talented

00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,120
multi-device world and

00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,370
support the fact that that's going to

00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:10,440
keep growing faster than our editors

00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:12,480
concerns will yeah so um maybe this ties

00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,790
in a little bit with that are contextual

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,230
thing but I was just going to say I mean

00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,730
just thinking about the menu system

00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,190
alone and the idea of having a pre

00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,110
expanded section and the idea of then

00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:24,210
maybe being able to drill open up other

00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,590
sections and going and that's been

00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,470
solved you know three four different

00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,880
ways just in Drupal on board and then

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,230
you know it's going to be approached a

00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,560
million different ways from all the

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:36,090
other you know our frameworks and so

00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,560
that all user once at the end is just

00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,360
that little pancake button and just to

00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:46,380
click on something but you know it's

00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:49,440
sort of so over diversify do we really

00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,400
exhaust other no week we can just

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,990
because they're clapping doesn't mean

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:57,330
we're done yeah well go ahead so back in

00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,040
the days when you built our own CRMs you

00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,900
know I did a lot of fiddling with trying

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,610
to headless stuff one of the big

00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,730
challenges of the forms you know you

00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:07,320
mentioned forms a PLA and has they

00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,690
actually been any practical thought

00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,690
about how we would manage the input

00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:16,170
output forms through this kind of thing

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,370
right so what I mean that you know what

00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,110
I keep talking about having a reference

00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:21,120
implementation is that there is no

00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,710
reference implementation there is no

00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,090
best practice you know in fact there

00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,860
might only be worst practices out there

00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,210
you know who knows because there isn't

00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:30,390
actually that much sharing going on

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:32,220
either and I'm encouraged to see as many

00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,440
people as there are in this room today

00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,700
but certainly anybody who's doing this

00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,560
sort of thing right now seems to be

00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,180
doing it mostly in isolation except for

00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,950
a couple people who are very verbose on

00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,110
the geo group and are sharing everything

00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,340
like code and everything um and I

00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:48,480
actually would wish a show less because

00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:50,310
I tend to dominate the channel but there

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,410
is no collaboration around this yet it's

00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:55,680
really really knew I mean it is really

00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:58,980
new and there is no structure there is

00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:02,160
no initiative there is no working

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,980
community even around this and I mean I

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,710
would at least consider it a minor minor

00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,510
minor victory if walking out of this

00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:11,460
drupalcon there was at least a more

00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:14,280
cohesive community of discussion around

00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,630
topic because they're obviously a lot of

00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,880
conversations to be had left you know

00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,290
beyond this 45-minute one and there are

00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,970
people who need to hear it beyond just

00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:25,680
you know Larry Garfield that who's who

00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,330
need to see the the importance of this

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,080
use case you know in a more broad sense

00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:33,090
and then on Larry side the kind of how

00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,370
far have we made any kind of progress

00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:37,710
which we wait on the removing of the

00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:39,510
button that is the you know with the

00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:44,000
admin functionality being a button on

00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,000
the form rather than being an API call

00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:53,550
it's a slow and ongoing battle progress

00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:56,370
is being made like the big one is the

00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,740
entity API actually exists independently

00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,150
of the node form now which is the first

00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,120
time intervals history that's been the

00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:06,420
case so that's huge win but it is an

00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,290
uphill battle because we're used to it's

00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,550
easy if I just do it all as one thing

00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:14,010
that doesn't make it simple that makes

00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,200
it easy for me to write right now but it

00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:17,700
means all I can do is that one use case

00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,700
and then that cuts off all of these

00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,140
other potential heads so you know I've

00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,640
been fighting the fight of a different

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,350
architectural level for a long time and

00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,640
it is a hard battle and that's why I'm

00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:30,990
asking you know how do we make that case

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,230
you know something else that occurs me

00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:37,710
who hears a module developer who's

00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:39,060
module developers in the room so I'm

00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,240
going to call it to you the same thing

00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,160
I've been saying a lot of my dev talks

00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,970
push everything you can to your twig

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,560
files in Drupal 8 because this is

00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,410
wonderful little tool called to make j/s

00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,800
that compiles to make templates the same

00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,000
to make templates you have in Drupal to

00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,170
JavaScript based templates instead of

00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,640
PHP based templates so you can override

00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,320
templates on the client side using

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,060
javascript instead of on the server side

00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,240
using PHP it's a little more work that

00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:11,100
I'm just hand waving but there are tools

00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,710
like that if we can push things to the

00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:17,730
right place that let us pick and choose

00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:19,620
selectively and I think that's my best

00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:21,480
guess is you know we need to be able to

00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:24,030
break things at a place where all right

00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,200
this piece we can then do selectively so

00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,720
it's not as much

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,480
rip out the head as you know start

00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,640
picking out hairs like push all display

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,260
logic to take templates because then

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,390
they can always be overridden and

00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:41,280
re-implemented client-side in JavaScript

00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,960
the the initial goal of the whiskey

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,810
initiative and of the Scotch initiative

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,150
was to have all blocks as their own

00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:52,650
things which means something like

00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:55,080
Facebook big pipe where you load at the

00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,360
skeleton then you parallel request 20

00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,740
blocks which come back at strings and

00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,410
you assemble them to the page becomes

00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,380
really easy to do that that's the kind

00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:06,720
of stuff we've been trying to build and

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:09,240
the biggest challenge has been fighting

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,160
against the architecture that is already

00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,200
there that makes that really really

00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,400
really hard and fighting into the people

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,210
who are still trying to lever to that

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,880
architecture so that's that's the

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:23,850
challenge we have is you know making a

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,910
different set of trade-offs to make this

00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,590
kind of stuff possible and just making

00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,720
the case for making a different set of

00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:34,260
trade-offs is hard even before you start

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,320
coding it no I agree I I don't expect

00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:40,320
this to be like an easy sell to to the

00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,700
larger Drupal community but somebody's

00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,420
got to carry the torch and so you know

00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,500
I'm here I'm up before before everybody

00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,210
leaves for luncheon because I'm really

00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,100
hungry too and I'm gonna start getting

00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,830
cranky and say opinionated things if I

00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,230
don't eat soon there is a buff a

00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:58,170
headless bath at one o'clock in G room

00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,850
g110 it's right after lunch so everybody

00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,350
should be you know sleepy and satisfied

00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,890
and we'll have much more moderate

00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,890
opinions yes

00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:36,230
when is it yeah oh you bring it at the

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,240
buff okay so if you come to buff you

00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:40,790
will show a scaffold application he's

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,400
building in marionette for writing web

00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:47,030
apps um once again cast your judgments

00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,880
upon me at this URL i'm at eating's if

00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,010
you want to hate me or tell me i'm

00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,330
stupid otherwise thanks everybody for
