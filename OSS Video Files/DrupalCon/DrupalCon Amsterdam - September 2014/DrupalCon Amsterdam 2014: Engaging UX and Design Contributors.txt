Title: DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014: Engaging UX and Design Contributors
Publication date: 2014-09-30
Playlist: DrupalCon Amsterdam - September 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: danigrrl
Many of the tools we use to get our work done (Groups.Drupal.org, the Issue Queue, IRC, etc.) are ineffective in facilitating the collaborative decision making that Drupal needs to move forward. As a result, discussions and collaboration most often happens at cons, and must then be brought to GDO or the Issue Queue, only to get hashed out again. Progress stalls.

The issues of collaboration and cooperative problem solving are those that designers and UX professionals deal with every day, and as designers, we are uniquely positioned to help. Drupal community leadership has begun to understand the importance of UX design to the continued growth of the project over the last few years. However, very little funding is put towards UX design, and UX activities tend to be focused on singular activities, e.g. the Drupal.org redesign, or issues facing a particular screen or module.

Additionally:

* Our current development processes are poorly set up for UX/research/design, e.g. discussing design within Issue Queues

* When UX issues are worked out, up to 60% of them are never implemented.

* Designers and UX professionals who donate their time to the community find that their contributions aren’t recognized, and sometimes face negative/harsh treatment from community members.

As a result, UX professionals and designers who enter the community tend to burn out within a few years, or they just don’t contribute.

In this presentation, veteran Drupal designer and UX Designer Dani Nordin will share some of the things she’s learned as the UX lead for the Drupal Community Tools team, such as:

* How the community currently collaborates on design and solves tough technical issues
* A vision for how the process can be improved
* Updates on the work that the Community Tools team is doing, and how you can help us move forward.

my name is danny and i am here to talk

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,599
to you guys today about engaging design

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,509
and ux contributors part of that is

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,139
going to involve talking a little bit

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,270
about what design actually means to me

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,270
and to hopefully many of you in this

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,650
room talking about what it's like to be

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,210
a designer in the Drupal community and

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,300
talking about some of the roadblocks

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,619
that I've uncovered in some of the

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,860
research that I've been doing in the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,940
community for the last couple of years

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,969
so first let me tell you a little bit

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,890
about me I am entirely too busy right

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,510
now I'm actually finishing my master's

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,730
degree at bentley university in the

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,789
boston area of massachusetts so that

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,460
means i'm working at both the bentley

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,760
user experience center and patients like

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,359
me and waltham or in cambridge so I've

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,710
got two jobs plus a thesis plus a

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,049
daughter and I also wrote a book called

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,170
Drupal for designers for O'Reilly in

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,060
2012 which is actually I'm going to be

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,670
signing those books tomorrow if anyone

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,479
wants to stop by and say hello because

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,220
clearly I have all the free time and

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,290
what else have I done oh yes I'm the UX

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,360
lead on the community tools team which

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,570
means that yes that was me in the

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,549
keynote and clearly I've gotten the

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,299
dress bump or you guys are just really

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,380
pumped about design either way I'm glad

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,259
to see you all so what I'd like to start

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,920
with is what happens when a designer

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,750
goes into a contribution sprint so how

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
many in this room are actually you know

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,500
consider yourselves designers whether

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,880
visual UX what have you okay and how

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,829
many of you have actually gone to

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:03,090
contribution sprints and like done done

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:06,439
work okay so let me I'd love to hear

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,439
your story a little

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:15,540
okay okay no worries so one of the

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,890
things that I did I've been going to

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,290
contribution sprints for quite a while

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,330
and at the last contribution sprint

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,430
which was at drupalcon Austin couple

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,950
things happened first thing that

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,140
happened was I try to start sort of a

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,269
community tools sprint because obviously

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,800
on the UX lead of the community tools

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,010
team now we've got a bunch of stuff that

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,690
we're working on and it turned into sort

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,250
of a an ad hoc research brainstorming

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,250
study so this is something that I do

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,780
fairly frequently I'm working with a

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,420
bunch of different people in the

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,880
community I'm pulling people out from

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,549
the hallways we've got whiteboards we've

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,950
got post-it notes we've got markers I'm

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,110
like in the zone right and we're

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,330
figuring out all of these problems what

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,640
is it that people are searching for why

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,959
do people actually come to do what is

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,310
the thing that they're looking for when

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,299
they're actually trying to get stuff

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,790
done and you know this to me is just a

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:15,540
beautiful thing this is what I do this

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,720
is what I love to do so now where the

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,100
hell do I put it we've got all of this

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,350
knowledge we've got all of this

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,910
interesting stuff like oh yeah so we

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,350
think that this is where we're going we

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,890
think this is where we should be heading

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,900
where do I put it so that someone who

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,780
actually works on this stuff can take

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,389
this knowledge and run with it so I

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,970
asked my collaborators so okay so where

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:45,410
should this go I'll put it in the issue

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:50,760
queue so now I'd like to take a moment

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:55,639
to have a fun activity here's the deed

00:03:50,760 --> 00:04:09,470
Otto homepage find the issue queue

00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:09,470
anyone sure but what project is this

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,000
yeah exactly but this is what we deal

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,919
with all the time isn't it even if

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,200
you're not like what was interesting is

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,270
I started studying contributors when I

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,789
first is it so a little bit of you know

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,890
back history about me and my infinite

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,450
schooling the master's degree one of the

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,909
things that I decided I wanted to do

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,770
elected I elected to do this when i

00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,419
started my master's program i said i

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,039
want to do a thesis and i want to

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,930
specifically do a thesis on the

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,120
roadblocks that design contributors face

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,180
in the Drupal community because nobody

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,440
does this research and I find it really

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,419
interesting i've been in the community

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,180
for five years I want to see what this

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,250
is so we can make this better and the

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,070
biggest thing that I found being an

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,650
actual design contributor was the minute

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,500
I had something that felt like we could

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,190
move forward I had no idea where to put

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,770
it and when it was explained to me where

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,020
I should put it yes I should look for

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,400
the project but guess what there was

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,000
something like three different projects

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,200
that it could be it and which one of the

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,300
projects do I put it it so just that

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,390
right there is more than enough

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:31,219
headaches for anyone who's not slightly

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,900
batty and I'll admit to that right now

00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:40,140
to say Oh screw this I'm not dealing

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:43,440
with this anymore but then another thing

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:49,979
happened at drupalcon austin so who

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:53,159
knows Morton yeah so Morton comes up and

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,430
in that classic Morton way says I am

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:57,719
going to scream I'm doing a very bad

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,680
Martin impression right now but that's

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:03,719
okay and I said well okay why hold on

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,810
why and he says we need to reach

00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:09,400
consensus so I said okay well then you

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,770
need post-its I have them so I

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,710
grab post-its out of my bag run out into

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,020
the hallway and basically put these

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,560
post-its on the wall grab some sheets of

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,330
paper I'm like art and I'm you know kind

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,130
of like I am now I tend to take my shoes

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,009
off when I'm thinking it's a weird thing

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,270
but we're running around and I'm saying

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,800
all right tell me what you found and

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,320
he's telling me about how theme errs

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,360
fall into two camps there's the I just

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,729
want clean code I want sensible defaults

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,889
and I want to control all the things and

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,940
we figured out the size of the camps and

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,070
we figured out all of these different

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,460
things and all of these strategies John

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:50,410
Alvin's shows up at the same time that

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,300
my toddler shows up and so I end up sort

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,310
of having to run around with my toddler

00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:03,760
and when I came back this whole group

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:05,500
had formed around John and Morton and so

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,229
there's some interesting things here now

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,000
this is not necessarily a critique as

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,300
much as it is an observation but one of

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,030
the things that happened was during this

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,740
moment I had actually pulled in three of

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,660
my friends who I knew to be in one of

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,760
the camps because I knew that Morton was

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,260
in the control all the things camp and I

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,610
knew we needed to hear perspective from

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,139
the people who just want sensible

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,240
defaults and I happened to see a couple

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,340
of them in the hallway so like I do I

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,500
just grabbed them and pulled them here

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,780
and says you you need to give him

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:42,280
perspective on this stuff but when I

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:45,250
came back this was what I saw so two of

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,870
those people the one on the far left and

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,490
the one and the woman in the middle

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,289
those were the people I brought in at

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,440
the beginning notice how now they're in

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:55,449
the periphery and it kind of looks like

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,860
everyone's just watching John and Morton

00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:02,560
arguing with each other so this is

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,930
something that I don't think we

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,320
acknowledge as much as we want to in the

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,440
community there are certain people we

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,830
tend to defer to as authorities and

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,490
until they show up it's often like we

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,700
don't necessarily think we have a say

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,540
and I observed this when I was working

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,150
on

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,370
user profiles so one of the things that

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,070
I've done recently is basically revamped

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,450
the user profiles for drupal org a lot

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,580
of the work that you saw and reeses

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,050
keynote started from that work that I

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,660
was doing and one of the things that I

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,680
experienced was he didn't feel like it

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,480
was gaining traction until Angie and Jen

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,250
hodgdon and couple of these other sort

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,030
of big-name contributors started

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,800
commenting on it and while we definitely

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,830
want to have this idea of you know

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,010
community leadership we also especially

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,890
as new contributors we shouldn't have to

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,590
like sit in the sidelines and feel like

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,750
well you know unless this person gets

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,570
involved I can't really say anything or

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,100
my contribution won't be valued all

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,900
right so this is this is something we

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,500
need to be aware of especially when

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:24,150
we're trying to make big big decisions

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,010
another thing we have to think about is

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:30,460
this particular event that i'm talking

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:34,330
about this consensus banana happened on

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:40,720
jun 2nd it took two weeks to get into

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:43,630
the issue queue from that date again not

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,730
a critique just an observation there's a

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,160
lot of half there's a lot of stuff a lot

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,220
of decisions get made a lot of important

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,220
conversations or had a lot of things

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,140
move forward at contribs vent spreads

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,490
that the community doesn't know about

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,570
usually for a couple of weeks afterwards

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,880
and if a person is not at drupalcon and

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,760
is not at the sprints they're often

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,720
completely left out of that conversation

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,040
and this goes for development goes for

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,940
design it goes for a lot of different

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,910
areas of control when I first started

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,560
the research that I'm doing now I really

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,570
thought that this was just about

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,370
designing the next contributors and how

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,260
they're so different than developers and

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,480
developers have it so easy but the more

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,870
I looked into it the more I realize this

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,010
is all over the Drupal community this is

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,950
the way this is the

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,930
roadblocks that we put in place and the

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:45,870
hoops that we make people go through

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:50,200
just to be productive as a contributor

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,900
so some of the things that are specific

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,770
to design and ux contributors that i

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,810
uncovered in my research and in terms of

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,780
methods i'm happy to go over like the

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,920
full methodology but this has been about

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,170
a year of interviews observation at code

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
sprints while i was actually

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,510
participating in them and also a survey

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,850
which had about 180 feedback from about

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,850
180 people most of whom were actually

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:22,390
contributors so some of the things that

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,980
i saw over and over again one was

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,470
getting feedback from everyone in the

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:31,300
community not just the couple of big

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:33,340
name contributors so this is specific to

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,260
design discussions on the profile for

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,210
example we really needed to get

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,040
everybody the hobbyists the new

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,720
contributors the people who are mostly

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,580
site builders the people who are using

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,980
the system we needed to get feedback

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,350
from a broad level of people what we

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,920
ended up with was a whole lot of

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,330
comments from three to five people who

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,210
were brave enough to deal with the issue

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,060
queue that day and then of course

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:01,200
there's the issue queue which is really

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,820
not designed to talk about design and

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,550
it's really not designed to help us make

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,500
big decisions that are you know that

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,480
that really need to be made when the

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,520
framework gets to this size I mean

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,520
there's a lot of hard decisions that we

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,110
as a community and we as a group of

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,070
individuals have to face and have to

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,780
deal with that we're not able to make

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:28,380
effectively because we're doing it all

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:31,090
in the issue kit but the other thing and

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:35,190
these two are very interested I found

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:40,410
very interesting one was this really

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:44,830
pervasive feeling that I'm not a coder I

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:48,210
don't write modules I I don't contribute

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,210
because I'm I don't know code

00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:55,589
I can't even tell you how many comments

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,239
i got like I don't know you know I can

00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,429
do usability testing but where would I

00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:00,809
put the results of that where someone

00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,639
would see them I don't like I don't know

00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:07,949
how to contribute this particular type

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:10,619
of thing and then the other thing is and

00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:16,610
this is specific I think to you I and

00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:21,059
design discussions there is a somewhat

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:24,989
obsessive need for rationale behind

00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,399
everything that you post I experienced

00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:31,559
it a little bit with the profile work

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,230
but you know in core I saw one case of a

00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,290
screen design for the create content

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:42,329
page 300 comments just in the issue

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:46,230
queue and prior to that it was six

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:48,179
months of debating groups and required a

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,059
blog post by all of the people who

00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,470
actually worked on that design

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,290
explaining why they made the changes

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,509
they made and the rationale behind them

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:01,309
and the whole process and I gotta tell

00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:06,689
you you saw what I do for a living I

00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:10,889
ain't got that time so can you imagine

00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:16,739
anyone else who has a family and a job

00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:19,169
and maybe is in school taking the time

00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:21,839
to write a blog post tweet about it go

00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:24,059
into IRC grab a bunch of people to go in

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,649
and comment on it hash everything out in

00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,910
groups and then bring it into the issue

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,629
queue so that you can hash everything

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,489
out again and we wonder why some

00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:37,319
seemingly simple changes take three

00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:40,319
years to implement so I wish I could say

00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:41,850
that this is just design but I've seen

00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:45,929
this happen with the train yeah I know

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,569
you you know I saw this happen also with

00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,970
the transition to github people are

00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:53,100
still bringing this issue up the the

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,869
github versus get lab or whatever it is

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,149
like I've seen this on groups and I

00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:58,889
follow it and like every couple of

00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,939
months someone else is like yes let's do

00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:02,279
github and

00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:04,649
and someone shoots them down and then

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:09,239
yes let's do a github that's been

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:12,689
happening for a year and a half and some

00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:15,569
of this I think is the nature of an open

00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:19,259
source community we're all humans humans

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:20,789
are kind of stupid and we don't

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:27,929
necessarily have time to read through

00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:29,220
all of the crap that we get fed but I

00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,209
think some of it we're doing to

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:37,769
ourselves and I worry that we're making

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:40,609
it actively difficult for people to come

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:45,229
in and actually be productive as

00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:53,879
contributors and still have lives I

00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:57,209
worry a lot about that so this is where

00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:01,169
I turn to you guys there are some ideas

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,729
that i have in my mind I think we have a

00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,889
messaging issue I think we have a

00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:11,220
process issue I think that there are

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,919
definitely ways that we can improve but

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,169
I want to hear from you guys how do we

00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,609
fix this what are the actual

00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,229
opportunities we have to make this

00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,799
better and how do we actually take

00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,799
action on them

00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:39,579
so two notes one I had a very similar

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:43,149
conversation with Mark Bolton five years

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,709
ago at drupalcon Paris because for those

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,499
who weren't around then mark Bolton was

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:50,139
hired to do the design for drupal.org

00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:53,339
and then hired to do the design for

00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:56,259
drupal 7 2 he designed the 7 theme and

00:16:53,339 --> 00:17:00,399
he got the same kind of nitpick on

00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:02,609
everything that annoys just about every

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,949
designer whoever touches drupal yeah and

00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:07,449
just let everyone else and when I say

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,980
designer I don't mean visual designer I

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,750
mean anyone who's doing anything higher

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,970
level than four lines of code I'm a

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,779
designer I'm just designing architecture

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,089
nuts not pictures so any design gets the

00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:20,490
same treatment and a lot of it is

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,750
because we're an open source community

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,669
open source people are used to being

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,899
able to crack something open look inside

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:32,279
and see how it works and design whatever

00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:34,750
logic it is inherently subjective

00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,909
there's an errant subjectivity to it

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,590
where you can't crack it open and look

00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:41,590
at every line of code to see how you got

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,299
there and so that annoys people who are

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,639
used to that so there's an inherent

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,629
conflict between just the open-source

00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:51,429
tinkering mentality and consistent dis

00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:54,429
fault through design because there's so

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:58,120
much subjectivity inherent in that and I

00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:01,509
would argue that there's a hell of a lot

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,769
of tinkering that happens in design but

00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:09,129
we as a community don't really have the

00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:11,409
tools and this is true of any community

00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,240
that deals with distributed teams by the

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:15,009
way it's not exclusive to the Drupal

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,399
community we don't have the tools to

00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:20,529
tanker that that make tinkering and

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:22,299
sketching and brainstorming like you

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:24,669
know wouldn't it be great to have a big

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:28,120
collaborative sketch board where we can

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:30,340
say okay you know like do mind maps

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,399
somewhere design doesn't have an inter

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,230
different exactly exactly design doesn't

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:39,279
have an intricate and it and it requires

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:41,710
many more people than someone sitting at

00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,669
work at their desk and writing a bunch

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,859
of lines of code

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,960
King sure it works and that is not to

00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,489
say that developers aren't creative I

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,440
actually believe that developers are

00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:54,960
some of the crate most creative people I

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,960
know but we solve problems differently

00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:00,899
and so I think that you know I would

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,909
argue that there's plenty of tinkering

00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:05,940
that happens in design it's just not

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,230
always visible absolutely i mean the

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,749
will code is a lot easier for someone

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,249
who is not tinkering to come in late

00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,769
look at it and understand all the bits

00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:17,799
and pieces not necessarily trivial but

00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,759
it's easier to do that with a patch than

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,799
it is with the design of you I mm-hmm

00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,419
the other points I'll note a huge part

00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,429
of the problem this is teaser for my

00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:30,960
core conversation tomorrow huge part of

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:34,960
it is our completely untransfected

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,489
leadership structure which means you

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
don't actually know who the big people

00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,700
are who wander and buy and you're

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,220
supposed to listen to them they exist

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,480
they're never not going to exist we

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,700
should just be explicit about who they

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,649
are and that will help a lot yeah but

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,779
right now we try to pretend it's not the

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:51,489
case which means relying to ourselves

00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,570
let's stop lying to ourselves more on

00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:55,330
that come to my core conversation

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,999
tomorrow afternoon well and actually

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,619
that gives me I mean that gives me the

00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,359
idea like one of the things I was

00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,789
thinking about is what if there were

00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,639
teams what if there wasn't we were

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:09,519
explicit that a module had a team behind

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,580
it that a section of core had a team

00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,139
behind it I mean how many of us how many

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,220
of us consider ourselves professional

00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:20,409
designers how many of us consider

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,450
ourselves like magic unicorns with the

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:27,460
design stick that you just wave and

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:29,859
design magically happens you awesome

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,210
glad i'll get i'll make sure to LIKE

00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:36,879
craft you a nice horn that you can wear

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,350
design requires people more than just

00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:40,450
about anything else i mean i've been

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,580
doing this since the freaking 90s I

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,429
can't I don't want to say that out loud

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:49,899
again I've been doing this for a long

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:51,639
freakin time and you know what when

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:54,460
you're just sitting and banging out

00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:54,919
comps you're not the designer in the

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,690
room

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,909
you're the pixel pusher you're the one

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,039
who makes things pretty when you're a

00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:05,450
designer you're at the head of the table

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,639
and helping everyone agree on what the

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,379
direction is you're listening to a bunch

00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:12,049
of different people from every different

00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:16,879
part of the room I mean that's what this

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:19,239
whole brainstorming thing was right so

00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:26,049
both of these things we're just as much

00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:30,489
design as putting together a compass

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:33,499
this is how we got to the user profile

00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:35,210
this is how we got to figuring out what

00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:37,220
the priorities are this is something

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,869
that designers do every day whether

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,879
we're sitting in a room putting together

00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,539
comps or whether we're facilitating

00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:46,369
workshops we have to decide what is the

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,899
most important and how do we give the

00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:52,549
most important things the visual

00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:55,190
prominence they need and so there's an

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,840
opportunity here for us as designers to

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,720
help facilitate those kind of

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,580
conversations within the stuff that we

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,379
see in drupal.org but we need the

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,379
infrastructure to support it

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:44,429
oh yes microphone oh alright so I'll

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:46,230
repeat what you're saying yes yeah and I

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,269
think that that's another I mean that's

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:52,169
another challenge I've seen so what what

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:55,500
Theodore is saying is that you know the

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:58,289
developers want to help us they do they

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,570
just need to know what to do and I mean

00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:02,970
that's actually one of the areas where I

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,980
think we as designers need to take some

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,529
leadership and we need to do some

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,779
self-reflection so we need to think what

00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:11,340
is it that we need to do but then also I

00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,720
mean this I think is one of the things

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,090
that the content working group is

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,460
working on right now like where do you

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,080
find things where do you find things

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,019
where do you put them we just don't know

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,389
anymore we've got too much crap on this

00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,740
site that's been growing for and what

00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:28,110
was it that you told me a design for

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,789
Drupal re like we've hacked the out

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,570
of the issue queue far beyond what it

00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:42,570
was ever meant to do like we know the

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:44,190
issue queue sucks yes exactly exactly so

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,740
I think you know this is one thing that

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,450
as you know as designers if you want to

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,940
contribute to Drupal there are things

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:56,100
for you to do but we need more designers

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,870
to come in and take leadership roles and

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,419
basically say this is you know what I

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,889
see we can do what can we do to make

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,909
this happen what can we do to facilitate

00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:11,250
this and this is where we turn to design

00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:15,990
as problem solving and also problem

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:17,970
defining I don't know how many of you

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,309
have done this kind of work but how many

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,070
times have you dealt with a client who

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:28,460
says I want XYZ widget

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:33,000
and you have to ask them okay so why and

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:36,630
they can't answer that question that's

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,120
where the Drupal community is now that's

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,730
really where we are right now we're

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,570
throwing all of these idea ideas at the

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,279
wall and what we need is more people to

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,610
come in and say okay so how is that

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:55,320
going to actually help us what is the

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:59,000
big picture here I mean if anything

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,000
that's where we're going to shine

00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:10,129
microphone oh they really packed you

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,129
guys tight didn't they

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,870
yes well and actually did you have

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,230
something to say learn oh you're just

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:36,870
okay um yeah and I think that you know I

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:40,350
think that Drupal can learn a lot from

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,270
the lean UX approach not necessarily the

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,919
anti deliverable approach because one of

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:49,700
the thing one of the uniqueness is of

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:52,620
our community is we exist everywhere and

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,570
so the person you are working on a

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,429
particular project with isn't it is

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,160
often not going to be in the same room

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,400
with you and you have to find ways to

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,100
encourage collaboration in a very

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,980
distributed and self-organizing team so

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:12,090
there are some ways in which we need to

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,370
be able to support asynchronous feedback

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,929
so you know feedback from someone who's

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,630
not necessarily in your same time zone

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:21,720
at the same time the big thing that we

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,360
really need is we need to be able to do

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,660
more than just discuss something we need

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:32,030
to be able to show design to essentially

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:34,830
show our work to use a math class term

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,419
now if you want to say something please

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,950
form a line behind the microphone this

00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,419
is getting recorded which means anyone

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,070
listening to this afterward will have no

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,270
clue what's happening for the second

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,040
half of this talk if you're not up here

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,540
it's true so it takes a while to get out

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,220
from the chairs just get up in front of

00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,130
line here please yeah i'm not sure why

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,590
we're not doing like a like a bob barker

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,000
like past the microphone around can you

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,740
say so it's wired not wireless

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,740
unfortunately I looked I checked

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,520
the Navy team would yell at me if I

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,620
tried to pull it up I know well he's

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,030
come up and stand by the microphone yeah

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,040
and the funny thing is like I tend to

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,510
walk around like I literally took my

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,390
shoes off because that's a thing that I

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,010
do and I like to walk around and when I

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,990
was in Austin it was the same problem I

00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:26,020
had to like stand here at the podium and

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:27,970
be very very still all right so I mean

00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,800
that's basically what I have to say but

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,870
I want to hear from you guys what what

00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:48,280
is it that you want to make happen how

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:50,890
do we fix this two questions yeah one is

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,780
a maybe because I walked in a little

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,140
later you know are we talking about UX

00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,600
contributions for d 0 and Drupal

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:03,220
infrastructure for triple projects or

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:06,820
four for what so when I talk about

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,970
design I kind of mean big d design which

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,400
is you know design is a way of solving

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,990
problems and really sort of getting down

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,860
to the nitty-gritty of what we're doing

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:20,020
here so on that level I consider design

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,090
and ux contributors to be people who

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,300
want to contribute design and ux to the

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:31,780
drupal project now that could be core it

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:34,990
could be contributed a like design for

00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,870
drupal does it could be any of those

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,000
things but I do think that we have a

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,590
significant issue when it comes to

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,480
discussing design like discussing design

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,790
essentially and design improvements

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,010
within Drupal itself and certainly

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,810
within drupal.org I think in general

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,390
that's true but when you separate out

00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,250
the idea that you know there's design

00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,540
and core and you know Drupal core and

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,580
the core is your Q whatever and then

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,740
design and this sort of federated

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,650
contribs base and then design and this

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,450
into this tertiary do sets right the

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,310
incentives for somebody to participate

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,720
in design are different for each one of

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,220
those facets right

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,530
the reason somebody would want to

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,530
participate in core design versus a

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:22,000
contributor group of persons and then

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:24,370
versus do which is at once really easy

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,730
to participate in and also impossible to

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:30,669
change yeah the incentives are all kind

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,350
of different for each right and so when

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,090
we're talking about how to solve this I

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,039
don't think there's like this one like

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,929
thing that we can say oh yeah boom that

00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,909
out fix for everything you know or even

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:43,270
that one approaches can even remotely

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:44,770
come close to solve yet yeah and I agree

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,380
with you there i think that you know i

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,659
think that the issue as most design

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,230
issues is more complex than just like

00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:54,909
let's come up with a solution i think

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,789
that one of the challenges that we face

00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:00,070
is that we have a very rigid process

00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,620
sort of defined for core or at least we

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,950
think we do but then we consider

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,890
contribs people can just do whatever

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,140
people want to do as long as they adhere

00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,000
to the coding standards and so as a

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,059
designer I think it's very hard to come

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,539
into this space and even know where to

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:22,090
contribute so where would I put my

00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:23,590
energy so why not focus on contribute

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:27,850
that being that that's the one of the

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,679
lowest barrier to entry I don't know

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,500
that it would be the lowest barrier to

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,330
entry because for example like one of

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,480
the things that I saw in this in the M

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:39,340
survey from designers was that

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,780
contribute a nurs are surely when you

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:46,150
try to suggest UI improvements and one

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,610
of the things that we do as you know one

00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,960
of the one of the particular situations

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,789
and why I focus on design and ux

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,470
contributors is that most often we're

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:58,510
not the ones implementing the things we

00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:02,650
design so an inherent complication of

00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:06,549
our job is that the duoc recei doesn't

00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,919
seem to apply to us because we can't

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:10,870
actually do the thing all we can do is

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,950
say here's what we think it should be

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:19,090
here's why we think it should be that

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:20,860
could you do it pretty please and even

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,580
when you do it we don't necessarily get

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,580
credit for it

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,360
so like so you know this is one of the

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,520
reasons why even though i think that the

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,100
the barriers that we put in place for

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,530
contributors happen across the board i

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,750
do think that designers and ux folks are

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,130
in a very particular spot because they

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,160
have to spend much more of their time

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:48,200
just defending their right to be on d

00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:49,490
data hub for the pop microphone I'm just

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:57,800
like you're like looking right at me so

00:32:49,490 --> 00:33:02,270
my gosh okay yeah maybe but something I

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:06,590
would like to add to this is that design

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:11,090
is not anymore just yet on to Drupal or

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:12,980
to any side you do I think we a Drupal

00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,920
we leg a little bit behind behind the

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:20,120
standards of UX and design when you look

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:23,180
at WordPress and at other upcoming CMS

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,350
they have really nice admin interfaces

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:32,150
and I think it would be really great if

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:34,760
we would wake up and integrate design

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,730
and ux more into our processes and I and

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,400
I agree with you it's not easy I have

00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:43,580
also tried it a little bit and I know

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,620
that there I think there are starts wed

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,330
turned out really well and where teams

00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,100
are working together but I think it's

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,440
not only a process change it's also a

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,950
cultural change yes people have to like

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,720
a developer have to accept or I have to

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,820
feel that that it's great to have a team

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,190
that is great to have info that it's not

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,590
only I sit in my room and I I coat this

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,600
down and I think it's also on the other

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,240
hand side we have to mobilize designer

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,490
said that there to to come with an issue

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,120
like now what everyone could do here in

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:16,370
the room is like taking a UX issue from

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,260
from Drupal that we all know from

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,970
working together with clients and go to

00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,580
the sprints with it and draw a little

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,870
walk up and say hey this is my idea this

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,700
is how it is now and this is how I

00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,980
wanted to be who would help you to

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,020
implement that mm-hmm and I think also

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,850
you know as designers like one of the

00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,580
things that we need to do is figure it

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,460
is learned

00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,050
what is the best way to give feedback

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,670
what is the tone we need to take what is

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,700
how do we suggest these improvements

00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,930
without just ranting about a module

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:48,030
because we've all seen how well that

00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:50,820
works so like so I think it's a give and

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,850
take on both sides developers need to be

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,710
able to welcome the input and say thank

00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:58,020
you for helping me and like how can we

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,480
work together on this and designers we

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,520
need to apply the same principles that

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,340
we take to our own work and apply those

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,750
to the developers of these modules and

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,000
say here's some issue here are some

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,860
areas I think we can improve here's a

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,100
sketch of what that might look like what

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,990
do you think as opposed to just going

00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,120
and ranting about a module and saying

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,120
this UI sucks here let me fix it for you

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:27,330
yes maybe a message of hope for UX and

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,640
designer well back in Drupal 7 there was

00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,120
much less people walking on the front

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,250
end is our CSS or JavaScript no HTML but

00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,560
now that's change we actually have a big

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,950
front end team that you know address

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,370
issues and those other guys that

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:49,230
implement UX and design you know new

00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:51,630
design in New York's stuff so it's going

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,090
to get better but we still need more

00:35:51,630 --> 00:36:00,120
people on the front end you know

00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:07,650
developers to help you basically so hang

00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:10,830
in there I guess have a two thoughts i

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:13,830
want to share and also as comments one

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:19,320
of the thoughts is every major company

00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:21,810
that works in the CMS business usually

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,170
they start a new project by launching a

00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:28,620
new UI so there's a completely new set

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:34,530
of I concert and everything so they

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:38,850
start by launching a new UX ish that's

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:42,330
thought number one which leads me to to

00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:44,800
to triple the problem may be the way

00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,890
that we are organized okay

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,010
I were work as a volunteer at a big

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,950
music musical festival in Denmark where

00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,950
I live we're about 10,000 volunteers and

00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:00,100
no one we created a lot of bars and

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:03,010
scenes but no one and I really mean no

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:07,740
one would make a sign for a bar without

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:12,400
going asking to the sign painters about

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:16,270
having the mega sign for us so nobody

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,630
does anything front end without asking

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:23,320
the design team mm okay so that's how

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:26,440
that music festival is organized so no

00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,010
one does front end without asking a real

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,010
designer

00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:40,720
yes please hey I'm new to the Drupal

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:45,480
community I'm from own cloud well

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,130
government and so from my experience the

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,920
working designers and developers working

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,900
together or you don't really have that

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,400
when you don't really have that much of

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,920
a split between developers and designers

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,140
you have fun tenders and stuff it really

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,720
no matter what the split is it really

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,430
boils down to the trust that people have

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,860
towards each other and that kind of

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,260
belongs to the designers to properly

00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,480
communicate and to properly document the

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,910
changes why stuff has changed that way

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,280
so i would actually disagree with what

00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,140
Larry said before that design is highly

00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,120
subjective I would actually say it's

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,740
largely objective because that's that's

00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,110
why I do usability testing you do

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,270
research you're right up specs you do

00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,470
mock-ups and stuff so actually mostly

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,760
design is really object if I would say

00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,000
sure not when it comes to theming that's

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,800
a different topic but in general I found

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,480
that that that works really well if you

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,060
if you document everything if you spec

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,770
everything you do mock-ups plus writing

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,060
then developers have trust that you were

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,060
making the right decisions because they

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,690
also see that it works and yeah they

00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,670
they come to you or to the designers

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,020
yeah and I think and I think that and I

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,760
think that that's definitely true to a

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,690
certain extent I think that what Larry

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,400
was trying to get at was that you know

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:10,690
design there's a lot of people who

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,730
either like or dislike a design so on

00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,530
that level yes it's subjective like

00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,940
there are there are some stakeholders

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,010
that all of us have had to deal with

00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:21,070
that really don't care what usability

00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:23,350
testing said they liked it that color

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:26,740
blue and they want it to stay that color

00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,540
blue right so so there's there's a

00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,590
little bit of both I think that one of

00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:36,040
the problems that design contributors

00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,930
face based on the research I've done is

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:42,400
not necessarily the need for

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:43,740
documentation but the excessive need for

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,710
documentation

00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:53,100
and feedback and like to a level like

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,869
this is your worst client and you know I

00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,490
don't think I've seen as much of it as

00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:59,460
some other people i think that the

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:02,340
community got a lot better in the time

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,050
that i was just sort of watching the

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,820
community and waiting for my opportunity

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,970
to actually come in and contribute

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,900
something but i mean there were times

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:15,540
literally where everything was months of

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,950
arguing yeah i mean that's the the flip

00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:23,160
side of it kind of that new contributors

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:26,430
it tends to be or sometimes tends to be

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,110
that people just or designer design

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,740
contributors just submit mock-ups or

00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,420
just submit visual changes without any

00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,820
reasoning behind it or so it seems and

00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,410
that's really a stark contrast to how it

00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,060
should be ended I mean actually working

00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,680
in an open source project as a designer

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,740
is the hardest thing I can really

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,510
mention like it's harder than any agency

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,950
so that's also really turning off the

00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,140
new contributors but at the same time

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:53,550
yeah the existing designers really need

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:57,200
to UM yeah document it yeah it's a

00:40:53,550 --> 00:41:01,369
two-way street it very much is thank you

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,540
two completely separate ideas so first

00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,250
the dis design is actually difficult

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,680
because you also need to think about the

00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,740
mental model and how the system can look

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,260
very different and different use cases

00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,750
so someone configures the drupal side

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,710
and has the same UI on the back end but

00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,960
it looked completely different because

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,300
there are different entity types or

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,220
whatever so you need to have like the

00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,800
complete picture in mind when designers

00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,070
of how it can look like in the different

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,960
situations where it apply which has

00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,730
different expectations for it so okay

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,410
and then the second thing that I sort of

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,540
that was just a quick idea I don't know

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,540
where it goes is if desires would

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,220
actually produce something like

00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:45,020
documentation like a spec or a design

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:48,030
patterns written or design guidelines

00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,680
anything that so that designers could

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,300
have a discussion and actually come up

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,130
with something without having to wait

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,130
for someone to implement it

00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,190
and then this could even be in inversion

00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,299
controller and so you would say like it

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,859
before it says yeah this should be

00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:03,390
yellow and then someone says yeah but I

00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:05,700
think right is better and then you just

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,740
say it change the census which says this

00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,630
thing should be yellow and you say this

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,400
should be right and then you make a

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,130
commit and you can't even explain what

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,960
you change and why you did it and so you

00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,390
would actually have something instead I

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,549
mean now if you discuss something and

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,319
then someone has to implement it and I

00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:24,920
have to look in the discussion what was

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,230
decided there that seems like

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:32,069
unproductive yeah I mean I think both

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:37,109
are good points I would argue that many

00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:39,509
of us who are designers are more than we

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,400
have our share of complex systems that

00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,869
we have to work with on a daily basis I

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,509
don't think that Drupal is unique in

00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:48,210
that so for example I work at a rail

00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:50,460
like patients like me where i work in

00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,529
cambridge is a rail shop and that is the

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,640
same thing I mean depending on what

00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:57,809
condition you have the entire UI changes

00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,109
and that's something that we're very

00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:03,269
familiar with in the Drupal world and in

00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:04,950
terms of design patterns that's actually

00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:07,920
something that is being worked on now is

00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,500
design patterns for contribute a nurs I

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,329
don't know the status of that just yet

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,579
but if anyone is interested in

00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,500
contributing to that get in touch with

00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:22,410
Louis diamond because he's doing a lot

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:25,259
of that work yeah so I was just going to

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:29,250
say I think one of the powers of having

00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:32,910
an open source project is the ability

00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,829
for you to just jump in and do whatever

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,599
that you want to override something that

00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:40,140
exists so you're my point is normalize

00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,839
up to get something into you know into a

00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,210
it can trigger instance you could just

00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,890
say you know i have i've created this

00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,240
patch do you want to implement this no

00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,369
that's fine i'm just going to roll my

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,599
own module that overrides your styles

00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:52,920
and then that's the way I want it and

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,569
then you can see what kind of adoption

00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,279
you get from the community and as the

00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,650
adoption gets bigger than that becomes

00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:59,200
more of a pertinent issue to get into

00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,109
there

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,030
module and this is I've done this a ton

00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:05,560
of times you know for panel Iser you

00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,170
nope analyzer was very ugly so I was

00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,030
like okay let's redo this and it might

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,040
much more you know a way that makes more

00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,079
sense for drupal and redid that and it's

00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,599
got a really big adoption right so i

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,180
think that there are ways for you to to

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,579
get in without having some not at the

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,560
mercy of it contributed for that the

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:27,369
maintainer of modules and the maintainer

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,200
of i guess it really only works in the

00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:30,970
module world and in the theme world

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,460
because you can't really say change this

00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:35,140
on do but it is it is it is a place

00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,869
where you can you know start to get

00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,520
introduced into you know doing some of

00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:43,900
your own design patterns without having

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,369
to require that piece of it to be part

00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,570
of it you don't have to have that begin

00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:47,530
to their module you can write your own

00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,660
patch where you can write your own

00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,040
module that overrides that so i think

00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,099
that's a pretty good way to go and it's

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,960
worked pretty well and people are okay

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,550
with having that be a method for you no

00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,710
getting around that at the maintainer

00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,780
stubborn in the case of what you've said

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:05,560
there so yeah well and at the same time

00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:06,880
though i mean many people who do you

00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,560
know many many of the people who do

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,970
patches end up contributing those

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,920
patches because it's one less thing for

00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:13,599
them to maintain exactly yeah so r in

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,670
cell right and then show that it has an

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:21,540
adoption then they become more likely to

00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:21,540
want to do that yeah so yes

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:28,500
yeah just had a thought about like

00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:31,590
culture modules okay is there any easy

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,850
way that a developer could ask a

00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:39,990
designer for UX help actually I think

00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:43,080
honestly the easiest way the the easiest

00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:46,440
way to reach out to you know designers

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:49,920
or UX designers is to list it on your

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,180
project page like we need to haven't

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,850
figured out a good way to solve this

00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:56,640
particular problem if you are interested

00:45:53,850 --> 00:46:03,990
in working with me on design or UX

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:07,110
please contact me hmm so there is a

00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,570
usability group I and you could also

00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,060
reach out to the usability group I feel

00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:15,210
like you'd probably get more immediate

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:17,700
traction if you listed on your project

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,020
page as well because that's where

00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,930
someone's going to read the

00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,360
documentation for your module and so

00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:27,120
your projects going to get more wide

00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,530
adoption if you have a complete you know

00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,880
here's what it does here's the

00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:34,890
documentation anyway so if you also say

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,330
you know these specific problems I

00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,950
haven't figured out a good solution for

00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,200
if you're a designer and you want to

00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,600
help with the UI please get in touch

00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,640
with me I think that's a really great

00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,820
way of signaling that you're open to

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:51,180
that feedback I was more thinking of

00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,250
like a bigger scale like hmmm where you

00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,420
could see like these people are at you

00:46:53,250 --> 00:47:00,860
XP pose you could ask them for help and

00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:03,770
so do yeah so that's actually that's a

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,740
fantastic idea I would love to see some

00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:10,280
sort of matchmaking service for you I

00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:13,820
and what yes I know I want to see

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,940
something like that and I think like

00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:19,100
that's where I'd like to see it headed I

00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:23,450
am on the community tools team I will

00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:26,000
bat my eyelashes at the DA I don't know

00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,770
how far we can get but that is

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,180
definitely something that I feel like

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:33,110
because I mean I really feel like

00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:35,120
contributes love it really does and I

00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:38,300
think that we do ourselves a disservice

00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:41,540
as a community by putting this distinct

00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:45,400
process or whatever we call it around

00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,400
core and then telling contribu contribu

00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:52,880
a major to service in that way because

00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:55,220
honestly even with court in the state it

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,480
is an eight which is very strong there's

00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,980
still a lot you can't do without

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,450
controls and so you know especially when

00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,970
you start getting into things like I

00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:09,860
mean workbench needs help you know like

00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,140
views needed help a long time ago

00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,550
wysiwyg net needed help like all of

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:17,540
these different things that just need

00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:20,030
they need some love so I think that's a

00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,660
great idea and I think that somebody

00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,660
should work on that

00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:34,280
there is I feel like Bo yawns the only

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:49,520
one in there like I don't know you are

00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:51,620
okay yeah I mean what I'm thinking

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,570
actually what I'm thinking is something

00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,180
more like what's in my mind is more

00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,410
along the lines of elegant ly I don't

00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,120
know if anyone is familiar with this

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,790
it's basically a service that hooks up

00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:05,510
designers with startups and in order to

00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:09,470
be listed there on this site as a

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,480
start-up you need to have a business

00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,010
plan you need to prove that your model

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,540
is scalable like there's all these

00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:19,070
things you need to do to prove that

00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:20,840
you're serious and then the designers

00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:23,000
get to go in there with their

00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,070
qualifications and decide whether you're

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,220
worth basically working for free and

00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:32,350
exchange for equity and I feel like if

00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,350
we had a model like that for contribs

00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,760
here's an example of my commitment to

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,750
this process I think that can work

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:48,320
really nicely for contribs to much more

00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,940
than what we currently put in front of

00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,210
contributors in fact it might even make

00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,550
it easier because it basically helps

00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:58,400
create these self-organizing teams that

00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:01,190
were being talked about next door you

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,200
know it's like I this you know I want to

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,570
make a module that does this but I need

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,040
a GUI behind it so I need a partner with

00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:14,120
I need a partner to help me with that

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:17,170
thank you and I think we have time for I

00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:23,650
let me just double check the time

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:28,130
1500 yeah okay I so I'm like I'm the

00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:30,619
core maintainer for the sub for sub

00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,700
system that probably has like the v well

00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:37,580
not probably that the worst you I ever

00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:40,070
namely field API infill you I and so

00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:44,000
standing at the other end of the line I

00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:46,520
kind of like I have the same position

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,440
and the same question as you alike I

00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:53,600
don't know how to make this happen that

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,000
like we get to a better feel you I I

00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,960
have no idea yeah what's wrong with it

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,940
to begin with I have no idea how to make

00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,970
that happen and I kind of know for sure

00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:07,940
that like it won't happen on the dot Oh

00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:11,330
issue cues and I've kind of like

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:14,600
completely abandoned even like getting

00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:17,180
involved in UI UX issues about Phil you

00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,520
I in the issue queue because after a

00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,859
couple of them like I know in advance

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,580
that they're not going anywhere mm-hmm

00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:27,980
and so like the the one single similar

00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:33,290
example that I know of and that I can

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:36,500
think of is the views you I that was the

00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:40,550
work that was done for views 387 and

00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:46,580
that thing only happened because a choir

00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:49,040
fund funded it yep and be it was kicked

00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,830
off well most of it happen in a

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,950
dedicated strength with people in one

00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:58,790
room for several days in a row to like

00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:01,310
hash the thing out because like it might

00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,770
be simpler it might be doable on the

00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:07,100
DDOT issue queue for maybe smaller

00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:10,790
scoped UX issue but for systems like

00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:13,550
this views fluid-filled API like it's a

00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,500
really a complex combination between the

00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:19,369
constraints of the of the system like

00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:22,010
why is the API that way because like it

00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:24,080
has its own set of fairly complex

00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,810
constraints like sorry it would be nice

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,069
that if the UI allowed that but like

00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,809
it's not possible because

00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:32,170
we can't code it or it wouldn't work

00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:36,640
because of this of that and getting each

00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:40,759
team with a an intimate knowledge of

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,459
that the workings of the the system

00:52:40,759 --> 00:52:45,999
we're trying to design a UX for like it

00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:49,069
really takes time and most of the like

00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:52,249
there are repeatedly one of suggestions

00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:55,279
I wish we could try that and you can

00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:57,799
shut them down pretty easily because no

00:52:55,279 --> 00:53:00,609
the API cannot support that and cannot

00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:02,869
work that way was it in that reason and

00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:06,140
getting to that point of knowledge text

00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:10,099
really takes time one other thing maybe

00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:13,219
is about I don't know maybe it's about

00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:17,719
tooling like I don't I have no clue what

00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:21,319
are the UX and mock ups and and design

00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:23,539
tools available except apart then like

00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:28,309
just writing the code and testing it

00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:33,109
live and there is one big limited scope

00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:36,829
but still it's a 2k 200k patch issue to

00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:38,930
make some part of feel you I better but

00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:41,660
like the current process it mostly is

00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,699
yeah we should try that way but in order

00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,160
to try it with someone needs to code it

00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:48,739
first and so it takes an immense amount

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,319
of time and it's just like it's after

00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:52,729
three iterations everyone is completely

00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:55,219
discouraged so maybe it's a question of

00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:57,529
tooling what could we wear tools could

00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:59,779
we use to like try things and agree on

00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:01,880
things without first having to code for

00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:04,430
them yeah well and I think this is I

00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,489
mean this blah you know this this belies

00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:10,690
the importance of having teams and

00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:16,599
having a designer on the team and and

00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:16,599
the end part of being on a team

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,869
certainly my role on projects as a

00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:23,029
designer is often to figure out what are

00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:25,279
those constraints and then how do we

00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:27,289
make improvements within those and in

00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,759
terms of tools I mean there are many

00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:30,739
different tools you can use it really

00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:33,559
depends on the designer but a lot of it

00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:35,900
you know this this is where the argument

00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:38,690
of having someone who is embedded with

00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,430
you guys and is going along that journey

00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:44,000
with you like I am the

00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:45,530
for field you I and so I've been saying

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,210
for a while we need design maintained

00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,460
errs as much as we need code maintained

00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:54,380
errs because a lot of the stuff that

00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:57,200
we're dealing with media field views

00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,940
like these are really complex systems

00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,040
with a lot of dependencies and a lot of

00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,140
things that you know you need that sort

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,690
of intimate knowledge and you need to

00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:08,240
stick with it for the entire period of

00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:12,080
time so i don't have an immediate answer

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:15,830
for you unfortunately but i would say if

00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,240
you have UX designers on your team or if

00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,550
you want to reach out to any of the

00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,310
folks in in here who were UX designers

00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:24,710
and just start talking to them about the

00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:26,420
issue at the sprint and say what are the

00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,370
what are the things that we can do here

00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:35,390
here's our limitations how do we design

00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:37,720
within them I'm a project manager so I'm

00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:40,850
mostly sitting between developers

00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:45,230
designers and this weird thing called

00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:49,420
customers and nobody mentioned customers

00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:51,590
yet today or even users user stories and

00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:55,150
these are usually the things that we use

00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:57,470
to find developers designers together

00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:59,390
you kind of that's kind of what you have

00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,730
there who's trying to have that could be

00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,110
a user story Oh yep and they could be a

00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,140
good basis for a dialogue between

00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:08,930
developers and designers and you know

00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,550
create common ground but I think the

00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:13,460
same solution is where we need to go

00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:15,560
yeah because you shouldn't be developing

00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,420
anything without a user story mm-hmm I

00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,660
know that sounds really annoying if your

00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:24,050
developer if you can't justify an

00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:26,030
inducer that really wants your function

00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,560
you shouldn't be doing it mmm it might

00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:30,860
be a technical issue but that's

00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,570
different that's really cool but most

00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,580
most of the stuff you do should have a

00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,320
story if it has a story that has a user

00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,210
interface and user interaction you

00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,190
should have a designer in there and you

00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,260
should of course have a project manager

00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,590
to make sure it all happens but it's a

00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,630
nice story but it needs to be a bit

00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,880
bigger everything and it needs to be

00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:51,800
pulled out of but yeah but I want to do

00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,110
this without anybody interfering with

00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,870
the stuff I'm doing with I see as sort

00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,490
of the developer idea and even the

00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:00,110
design idea sometimes you know I'd like

00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:02,180
to do this and I'm doing it in my free

00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:04,730
time so nobody should tell me what I

00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,640
should do that's ok if you're doing your

00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:11,180
own home page or doing it for yourself

00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,560
but this is gotten too big for that it's

00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,430
okay if you're in the French somewhere

00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:18,140
in doing your own module that's ok but

00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,610
if you won't make a good module that

00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,900
should be used by a lot of people you

00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,480
need to get a designer and there you

00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,160
need to have a team I'm not saying you

00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,050
need a project manager but it might be a

00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,670
good idea to make sure that somebody you

00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,680
know it goes out there and finds the

00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,870
right resources for you knows who to

00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,450
talk to know how to pull in the right

00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:38,810
resources and more developers if needed

00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:40,820
so I'm not I mean there are tools for

00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:43,130
doing that like professional tools for

00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,630
project management well I thought also

00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,220
that's where I mean that's certainly

00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:49,970
where organizational credit comes in

00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,550
because you know certainly in in Larry's

00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:57,070
case at palantir like you guys have

00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:57,070
teams that are working on modules right

00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,260
nominally not as much as we'd like to ok

00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:08,030
so you guys should have teams that are

00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:09,470
working on modules right but yeah I

00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:12,020
think that you know organizational

00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:13,850
credit can go towards that and I do

00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:16,640
think that like one of the one of the

00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:19,310
differences I observed when I was

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,190
talking with French contributors last

00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:24,980
year is that there is a very different

00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:28,520
way that French companies treat can trip

00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:31,040
it's part of their workday you get X

00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,440
amount of hours during the work week to

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,570
work on contrib and in the States that's

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,660
very often not the case you're sort of

00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:45,860
expected to do work stuff if you can

00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:47,330
manage this contribu contribu ters end

00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,480
up contributing on their own time in the

00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:52,400
States and I got to tell you I've got a

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,040
toddler I've got too many things to do

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,930
how much time do I have to actually

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:01,350
engage in control

00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:05,590
so there's a little bit of got to give

00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:09,670
happening so I'm going to have to agree

00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:11,170
with the previous commenter on the one

00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,900
hand yes project management does matter

00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,160
the actual team matters the there are

00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,550
only there were like seven core

00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:20,560
initiatives officially for Drupal 8

00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,470
there were only two I would call a

00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,630
success on mine isn't one of them and

00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:28,840
the primary one is views because they

00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:31,720
had from day one to developers a project

00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,130
manager / coordinator there was three

00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,290
developer center corner but they they

00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:38,830
had a team with different roles with

00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:41,710
resourcing from day one it was the only

00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:43,870
initiative that went well every other

00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,640
initiative has been a train wreck for

00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,020
that reason and some of them have been

00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,520
completely disabled right because I

00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,960
think the design and initiative went

00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,960
nowhere the design initiative was

00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,620
stillborn whiskey I'm struggling along

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,960
through sheer force of stubbornness

00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:01,060
Scotch disappeared most the others

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,070
petered out eventually to some degree of

01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,920
we got enough done that we can go home

01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:07,660
now yeah views is the only one that was

01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,500
organized correctly because they had an

01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:13,810
actual team I will have to need the

01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,190
world disagree though is if you're

01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,070
dealing with the bespoke application

01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:19,360
then yes everything is a user story if

01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,030
there's no UI you don't bother building

01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,310
it Drupal core is a platform not a

01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:26,860
bespoke application so the rules are a

01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:29,380
bit different certainly anything into

01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:30,820
you I should have a user story around it

01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,240
and have a goal on a purpose and fit

01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,490
into a bigger picture but to when you're

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,280
building a platform to get to their

01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:43,870
often requires a lot more plumbing than

01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,780
then that would imply and one of our big

01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:49,210
problems in Drupal historically has been

01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,800
that we don't actually have api's we

01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:54,040
have you is that are tied directly to

01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,080
database yeah and you know we need to

01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,330
break those apart to a larger stance

01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:02,440
that you can design a UI and a workflow

01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:04,720
and a user experience an independent of

01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,390
that design a developer experience and

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,490
design the API is designed the the core

01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:11,900
components and so on and those should be

01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:14,180
decoupled from each other far more than

01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:17,750
they are now and that would I think

01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:21,920
actually give a lot more flexibility to

01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:25,160
people who want to be as at you I

01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,810
developers for lack of a better term I

01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,880
mean the kind of stuff that I do very

01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,950
rarely has a UI to it the stuff I've

01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,260
been doing a Drupal 8 so I don't deal

01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,869
with designers on a regular basis the

01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,700
team that wants to now do panels and

01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:39,440
Drupal 8 oh my god do they need a

01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,330
designer working with or from day one if

01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,300
you're interested in that please please

01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:48,440
that's like the most important

01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:50,300
contributors working on it please but

01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,820
you know we need to keep those decoupled

01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,810
and have that separation there so I

01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,460
think it's also question not just

01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:57,860
getting designers and developers working

01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,200
together but the right designers and the

01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:02,630
right developers on the right parts of

01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,850
the system because low-level API is

01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:07,460
should not be dictated by you I and vice

01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:09,320
versa yeah I also think that you know I

01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,440
also think that what's you know an

01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:16,490
important thing to think about is who

01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:19,790
I'm losing my thought all right it's

01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:22,340
late then I think it's important to also

01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:25,040
to bring back this point about a user

01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:28,640
story is that you know a user story

01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:31,850
could be if you need to make this happen

01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:34,430
on your website this is the module so I

01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:36,770
almost view a user story as an excuse

01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:38,480
for this module to exist and something

01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:40,400
that should be on everyone's project

01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,630
page if you can't tell me why this

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:47,420
module exists and when I would actually

01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:50,150
need this module like it shouldn't be on

01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,190
ddoddo feature request I user story

01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,960
field for project notes yeah like

01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:56,000
seriously because it's one of those

01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,810
things like this is just you know who

01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,580
here works for themselves ok so those of

01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,590
us who work for ourselves we understand

01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:07,340
the importance of actually saying this

01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:10,070
is why you should hire me right we do

01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,869
that for a living daily we say this is

01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,640
what we do this is what we bring to the

01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:17,210
yard this is why you should hire me and

01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:20,060
it's remarkable to me when I see project

01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:23,540
pages that have like yeah this module

01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:24,789
does this thing and that's all that it

01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,799
says

01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:30,680
like this does not help me understand

01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:33,200
whether i should use your module i think

01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:36,049
a lot of what I'm hearing is the same

01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,579
thing we've been saying every time we've

01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:39,829
had one of these score conversations the

01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:42,259
past six years which is we need to talk

01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:46,819
more and we need to talk at the right

01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:48,920
time yeah the focus should be on how do

01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:50,960
we get the people talking at the right

01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,099
time and already close that

01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,259
communication there have been several

01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:56,450
failed attempts to do that got it we had

01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:59,319
a tag at one point four hey I need a

01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:02,180
designer to look at this issue it died

01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:04,369
because a tag in the issue queue is

01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,789
meaningless unless you know that you're

01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:11,630
looking for that tag yeah and you know

01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:13,660
no one has ever owned making and

01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:16,759
maintaining that communication channel

01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:19,130
because yet well every time this come up

01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:20,630
as a module developer I've said dear God

01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:22,250
please designers just tell me what to do

01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,509
with the UI for my module I'll do it I

01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,069
don't want to think about it just give

01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:26,440
me instructions i'll do it and most

01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:31,220
module developers i know have a similar

01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:33,380
attitude yeah so just the focus needs to

01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,849
be on the demand is there on both sides

01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:36,799
how can i connect it how can we do that

01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:38,150
matchmaking there that's what we need to

01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,400
put our focus to make that connection

01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,890
happen and I completely agree with you I

01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,109
mean I the things that I've been arguing

01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:47,960
for is a design maintainer ship over

01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:50,769
modules like actually have a designer

01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,440
listed as a co maintainer of a module

01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:56,750
and just the ability to have some kind

01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,609
of structure around teams and some kind

01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:00,470
of structure that's around expectations

01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:03,680
not just of what your code will look

01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:06,349
like but of how you talk about your

01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,240
module and why people should use it you

01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:11,660
know I mean these are not super high

01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,700
expectations to set but the fact that

01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,349
we're not doing it I think is doing a

01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:18,410
disservice both to core and to

01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:19,730
contribute to lling can we do to make

01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:23,930
that happen I guess that the open

01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:26,299
question okay I think this is the last

01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:29,420
one and then we're done so I think this

01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:33,109
is a really valuable discussion and I

01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:35,030
we should continue on this okay for

01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:37,430
example i am here still on friday for

01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:40,640
the sprints okay i would be ready to

01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:42,740
discuss and sweet yeah all right well i

01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,109
will also be at this print so I think

01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:48,740
hold on one second there were like two

01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:57,799
slides that were related to that as a

01:05:48,740 --> 01:06:04,280
matter of fact okay so one is tell me

01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:07,339
that you love me feedback and there is a

01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:10,309
sprint on friday i will be there working

01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:15,619
with Tatiana on a bunch of community

01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:18,530
initiatives so please if you see me come

01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:21,740
sit down talk to me bring me coffee I

01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:23,809
will need it and I really hope we can

01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:26,770
get some good stuff happening and thank

01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:26,770
