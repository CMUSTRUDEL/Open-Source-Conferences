	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
and go ahead and get rolling all right

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,839
so here we are to talk about big systems

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,160
and big problems so lessons learned from

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,360
building 40 design systems

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,280
so oops heading a little fast my name is

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,080
kate eyler worthy i'm the director of

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,560
solution delivery

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,320
palantir.net so my area of specialty is

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
in content strategy i wrote a couple of

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
books about it a couple years back so in

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
internet years they're kind of out of

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
date

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
um but it is still where i spend my time

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
and i'm presenting with carl

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,679
and i want to make sure kate are we

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
going to the next slide because i only

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,520
see

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,760
big systems big problems so i want to

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
make sure

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,079
first technical difficulty here yes

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,079
the best kind you do not see

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,680
the hello slide oh they see hello okay

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,120
all right if they can see it then i

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,920
can't so that

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,600
might be interesting for me but uh i

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,640
will i will keep going so hopefully

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,760
we're on the same page

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
they may need to do it fresh um

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
possibly refresh so maybe i should

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:13,840
refresh and see if that fixes it quick

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:13,840
how about that sure

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
thomas has really got the key point here

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
okay now i see it fine all right fine

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
okay

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,479
so i'm karl martin's uh i'm a senior web

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
designer and ux architect at palantir

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,280
so i've helped design and develop

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,119
multiple design systems at palantir

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
in which several of those have actually

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,079
been award-winning

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
so um okay i'm not seeing the slide

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
switch

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,119
is it switched to the next slide it is

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
switched all right

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
all right well i'll i'll just keep going

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
so before we get started with the

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
presentation we want to do a quick

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
uh definition of terms as we walk

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
through this so

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,799
um a design system is a series of

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
elements

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
and components and templates uh that can

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
be reused in different combinations to

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
construct consistent

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
on brand pages uh so we start with the

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
smallest which would be elements those

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
would be

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
your typographical things your your

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
buttons different things

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
things like that which then feed into

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,360
components were our combination of those

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,640
pieces

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
which will eventually lead into bigger

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,319
pieces that you can basically put

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,400
together within a template

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,360
the underlining idea is to change our

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
thinking of

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,680
of pages into reusable components and

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
templates

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
component based design is how we make

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,319
everything scalable

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
so the templates ensure the client has a

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,760
vision of the final product

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
while providing guidance to content

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,480
writers and developers as we build out

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,040
drupal sites

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
great and to build on this just to talk

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
briefly about why design systems are so

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
essential

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
so a lot of the design system discourse

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
is really technical

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
uh the focus is on creating consistent

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
interfaces across multiple systems and

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
screens

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but the value of a design system for a

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,680
cms is a little different

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
so the job of the design system and a

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,599
cms is deliver content

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,800
there's often thousands and thousands of

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,239
pages of it

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,920
um so design systems enable cms sites to

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
deliver content in a way that's

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,120
beautiful

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
and consistent and user friendly so this

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
design that carl created for etf has won

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,159
several awards

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
it's gotten consistently higher reviews

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,280
from users

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
but it's really in a crisis where the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
design system shines so etf was able to

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
use their own in-house resources to spin

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
up

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
really comprehensive cobia 19

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,640
communications we built that system in

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
2018 since very definitely in the before

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
times

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,080
uh so whoops the key here is that while

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
kova 19

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
and all that supporting content is new

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
best practices for organizing and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
displaying information online

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
is not and a big part of the value of a

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
design system is to support

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,200
urgent and unforeseen communication

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,040
needs on short notice

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,799
so the single biggest lesson we've

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
learned from building 40 plus design

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
systems

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
is that great design systems are built

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
by interdisciplinary teams

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
so the titles are going to differ from

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
org to org

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
but essentially what you need is a

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,840
content expert a design expert

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
an engineering expert and a business

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
expert

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,320
so that's a lot of people to wrangle up

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
and

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,560
that can sound kind of time consuming

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
and expensive but in our experience this

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,680
approach isn't just

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,080
better it's faster and it's cheaper

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and the reason why it's cheaper and

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
faster and better is because

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
misaligned teams create product and

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
client team relationship issues and

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
this is a really common dominant chain

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
problem we've experienced where

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
the designers create designs and

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
interfaces that the content and the data

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,120
don't actually support

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,960
then they throw it over the wall to the

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
engineers who point out that the designs

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
that at this point the client really

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
loves

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
can't be built either within the current

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
budget or maybe even at all

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
and now we have to make it work or we

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
have to go have a hard conversation with

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
the client that ends with them either

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
paying more than they expected or

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
getting less than they expected

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
now your team's mad at each other

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,919
clients unhappy

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
um so getting the content design

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,680
engineering and business people working

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,520
together early and often

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,520
often prevents that whole daisy chain

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,199
so the cheap difficulty is keeping the

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
team aligned

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,400
um for everyone to get their work done

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,639
so we have to realize that everyone has

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
basically their own type of deliverable

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,000
or output that they're working with so

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
there's visual design there's word docs

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,440
there's code

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,600
there's spreadsheets in order to build a

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
shared understanding we need a common

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,479
language

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,080
so the most effective cross-team

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,240
collaboration we've found

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
is actually sketching so working

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
together to sketch

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
each type of practitioner can sketch at

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
very degrees of fidelity

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
and with varying the skills uh degrees

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,919
of skills as well so you don't have to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,759
be a good

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,600
sketcher at any point to be able to kind

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
of work together as a group to have a

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,160
shared understanding

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,759
of what everything means so what about

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,199
this with sketching the team is creating

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
a shared understanding

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
and then translating that understanding

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
into individual disciplines

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
and tasks that they have to take on on

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,240
their own

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
with that the client is also getting

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
some hand on education on how the site

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
will

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
flow and function as well as starting to

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
get introduced into the editorial

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
process

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,319
and this is huge because uh really the

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
project success

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
at least from the client's perspective

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,840
hinges on

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
is this editorial experience working

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
well for me and my team

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
if it's if it's be if it's a little bit

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
clunky or if it's just not very

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
intuitive or it's not getting the job

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
done

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
then that means that the strategy

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
strategist designer and the engineer

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
haven't done

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
their part

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,319
so let's talk about details we've got

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
this into a couple of sections the first

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
is how

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,360
from scratch from the start you start

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
identifying your components

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,280
and next up talking about building that

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
team alignment and how to do it

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
uh and then we're going to talk about

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,319
documenting your system and then close

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,000
it out with like a really quick tldr

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
uh so before you get to sketch there's

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
some groundwork that needs to be

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
laid first and the key concept for this

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,680
section is really that for a cms

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
a design system should be built to serve

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
the content so in other words the first

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,479
step to successfully building a good

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
design system

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
is to assess and prioritize the content

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
that you're designing for

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,360
so at palantir this task is typically

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
owned by a strategist or even an

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,919
engineer

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
rather than a designer so we're starting

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,120
our cross-team collaboration right out

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
of the gate

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
now when i see that a design system

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
should serve the content

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
this is what i mean we're going to take

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
a look at these two examples of the same

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
component

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
so these two tabbed components i

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
pulled those screenshots off the same

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,800
page one element apart

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,400
so it's the same thing and they're

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
containing two completely different

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,039
types of content one of them is a list

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,879
of programs and the other is an faq

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
the thing is they look the same so

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
they're providing the visitors zero cues

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
about the information that each

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
component is conveying

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
and this doesn't work because people

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
don't read online they scan

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
and for a website that serves thousands

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
of pages of content

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
the most important thing we can do to

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,919
reduce noise and

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
increase ease of use is to provide

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,800
visual cues

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
about written content for people who are

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
scanning and when you use the same

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,960
visual design to serve different types

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
of content

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
you're forcing your readers to slow down

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
and read at a much more detailed level

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
than they prefer

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
some of those visitors are going to

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
leave and i feel like i ought to at

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
least say that

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
i had to go back into the wayback

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,919
machine to get these devry has since

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,919
done a redesign and fixed this problem

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,959
so your first step to creating your

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,560
component list

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,240
your just list of components that are

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,600
going to build is to assess and

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,399
prioritize your content

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
and so the steps here are basically

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
three

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,480
you want to start with what's the site's

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,240
job you want to stop and think about

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,399
what the site actually has to do

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
what's the business reason it exists and

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
what are the key business user

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,440
and end goals for the site so if you're

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,279
a health system then it's like the

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
fundamental reason that that site exists

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
is patient acquisition so you want to

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
start there

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
and then next you want to start thinking

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
about the key flows that deliver against

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,279
that key business and user

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
goal set and if you're trying to require

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,519
patience then those are things like

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,279
uh finding a doctor making an

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
appointment sometimes it's that front

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,720
page triage

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,560
and then the next step after that is

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
once you've got your core flows

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,080
you can just start bashing out a list of

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
the types of content that will persuade

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
and inform or even delay your visitors

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
into converting

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
and for health systems that can be clear

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
short up-to-date information on

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,760
cutting-edge treatments

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,120
it's doctor profiles things like that

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,399
and at this stage of the proceedings

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
typically we just have a big list

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
and then the next step from that is to

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
start thinking about um

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
differentiating your content so the

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,959
kinds of things you want to be asking

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
yourself is hey does this type of

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
content need its own component

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
you're looking at things like the

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,440
structure what are the core elements

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,959
does it need to be locked down to

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
certain fields does it need to be more

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
flexible

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
you want to look at how it's being

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,959
created and its constraints is the

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,480
content created on this page is it being

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,160
pulled in from a different node or a

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
third party integration what control do

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
we have

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,720
and then also is it important is this

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
content really necessary

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
to help move visitors forward in their

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
journey

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
so that's sort of the hi look but i want

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,279
to hand it over to carl

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,800
to talk through an example yeah so the

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,440
example we're going to be using today is

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,880
actually our own website so palantir.net

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
we're actually going through

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,360
a redesign process right now and we

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
thought this would be a good candidate

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
to be able to walk through

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
this stuff is because we can essentially

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
show you all of the the messy behind the

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
scenes stuff

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,000
that we're currently working on so

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,839
before we do anything we want to take a

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,800
snapshot we want to look at

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
uh what the current site looks like yeah

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
and

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,720
really kind of ask ourselves the

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
question does the design system

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
serve the content currently and the

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,480
answer is actually no

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,720
the home page does need quite a bit of

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
help um you could basically say where do

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,200
people click when they get here

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,880
there are notifying sections no labels

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
uh just similar looking

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
components in a big list so the design

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
system

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
is not serving the content very well in

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
this state

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040
so basically before we do anything

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
before we get into

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
sketching or or kind of thinking about

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,360
mocking things up or anything like that

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,720
we have to ask ourselves the question

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
what is palantir.net's job and to do

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
that we need to be thinking with the

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,160
client

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,839
what are the business goals what are the

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,640
audience goals and what are the metrics

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,480
and kpis or key performance indicators

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,240
that are important for the website to do

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,640
its job and so

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
we we throw all of those out and we

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
essentially

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,959
start to create uh what we call a a

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
mapping matrix

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,120
of these where we can start to pull

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,040
threads between relationships of

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
business goals to audience goals and

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,120
then to make

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
and excuse me and then to the kpis and

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
what this essentially does is it gives

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
us a road

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,519
map for the different sections and

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
features um and destinations that people

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,720
will have when they're on the website

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,399
uh we then can use that to reorder we

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
can use that to prioritize the order of

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,480
the list as well

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,639
uh which basically gives us an idea of

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,880
what's most important for us to complete

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,800
uh within this the timeline that we have

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,880
for the project

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,320
so from there we can start looking from

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,120
a high level at

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
the user flows but first the way that we

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,240
define use the floor

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,800
user flows is this a useful is a

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
complete path a user takes when using a

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,720
website to complete a task

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
the user flow lays out the user's

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,120
movements the website mapping out each

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,120
and every step that the user takes

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,760
from the entry point right through to

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,760
the final interaction that they have

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,079
so really all these user flows are doing

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,279
is illustrating the goals that we have

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,480
within the matrix

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,519
on the previous slide so the examples

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
that we came up with

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,399
with here to identify would be palantirs

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,720
proven solutions

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
technical strategic thought leadership

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
and then careers in

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,320
that palantir so just to name a few so

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
to look at one of these as an example uh

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
we have

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,880
proven solutions uh and the question

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,240
really is has

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,519
palantir solved my problem before and we

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,920
basically just want to

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,760
have uh we want to create a high level

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,079
look at this we want to kind of take the

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,399
30 000 foot view of of what the

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,440
potential path that a user might have

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,120
as a navigate navigate through a given

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
task that they might have

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
so we think about what are the entry

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,320
points so maybe they're coming to their

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,160
home page maybe it's a side door maybe

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,000
through google something like that

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,560
you know what's kind of the in between

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
page maybe it's a service line type page

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
uh where they can get a little bit more

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,199
information

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
about answering the question you know

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
has palantir solved this problem

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,480
and then lastly what are the actions

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,000
that they're taking so

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
what pages are they getting to where

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,360
they can actually start to take

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,279
action and potentially find a solution

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
or work with palantir

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,800
what's also great about this is that it

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
validates the budget and timeline with

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
the client so in conversations that we

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
have with the client we're really

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,320
starting to understand

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
the complexity of these user user flows

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,279
as well

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
you might come into these thinking that

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,959
it might be pretty simple

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,480
and then going through this exercise

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,680
might identify that it's much more

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,800
complex

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,320
than you originally thought so from

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,639
there

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,560
we're wanting to uh find what what is

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,680
the content that that serves these

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,279
uh particular flows and to do this

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
we we basically want to be thinking

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,199
about what does the audience care about

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
uh when they're when they're interacting

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,000
with these different types of templates

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,839
right so um in the so basically what

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,480
we're wanting to do here is just take

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,279
inventory of what those potential

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
components

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,440
and pieces of content might be within a

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,959
given flow

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
and what's great about this is it really

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,360
allows us to focus specifically on

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,279
completing this particular task we're

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
not we're not bloating

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,800
uh the overall inventory of components

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
or

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,480
pieces of content that we want to build

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,519
for the site but rather making it a

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
little bit more lean

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
and specific to serving a specific goal

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
and tasks that a user would have

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,600
so those things could be maybe a list of

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,160
case studies

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
or different awards listings or blog

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,800
posts

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,079
things like that that we want to be able

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
to list out at this point

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,600
so once we've identified

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,040
our list of content now we can start to

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
uh basically kind of rough out our

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,480
content model

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,560
and we just use google spreadsheets for

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,560
this it's easy for us to kind of

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,880
enter the the specifics at this point

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,360
into a spreadsheet and this is typically

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
done by a strategist or or an engineer

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
uh but we start to take a look at what

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,600
type of content we're looking at so

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,199
for instance uh we can start to identify

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759
what is the narrative content

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,240
that uh that a content editor would need

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,160
to be interacting with or create

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,160
and typically that would be content that

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,360
you can find on a landing page

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,959
a news section or a blog section and

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
really what we're trying to do here is

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
just take

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
quick inventory of what are those pieces

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
of information what are those fields and

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,480
elements

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,600
that basically build out

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,600
narrative type content

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,959
but along with that we can also start

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
looking at the data

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
database driven content as well so

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
database driven

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
content is content that's stored on the

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
server uh server and

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
uh served through the database uh the

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
example that we typically use for this

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,920
would be

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,680
um being like a doctor profile that's

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
content that's usually being served

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,959
in and and presented on the page uh

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,560
through structured

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,920
data um so for data-driven content the

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,000
key is to have a good working

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,800
understanding of what type of data

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,480
is available to us to be able to push uh

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,480
there's been situations in the past

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,280
where either a team member or client

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,720
asks asks a question like uh you know

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
wouldn't it be cool if we can show the

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,640
insurance policies of

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
what the doctor accepts on their profile

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
page

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,439
and the answer could be yeah that's

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,520
really cool we can if we could do that

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,559
but does the data actually

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,079
uh exist is it in the database if it is

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
that's that's cool we can show it if

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,039
it's not

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
then we know that content can't be

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
displayed we can't just but we can't

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,880
show that particular content

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,280
um on that given page so what this is

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,320
doing doing is really helping us give

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,600
uh guiding rules for what's available um

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,440
as we progress down the path

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
so starting with content in this way and

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,400
even doing this sort of rough

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
content modeling and database analysis

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
is doing a couple of things for us

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
again it's really validating that

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,760
project scope and budget and timeline

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
um during the sales process you make

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,559
guesses based on like sort of a high

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,280
level look

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,600
roughing this work out helps you map

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,440
that

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
to the actual content and the actual

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
site and validate it

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
and at this stage if it turns out that

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
actually need more budget

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
it's a much easier time to have that

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
conversation with a client because

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
either they can get it or

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,120
they can say like actually let's pivot

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
and think about this a slightly

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,240
different way

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,400
and it's also really helpful to us we

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,480
found just for client coaching um

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,480
our clients are typically uh they own

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,679
the process of content creation and

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,600
proliferation

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
this is sort of like a nice introductory

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,320
way for them to start like

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,600
mapping out the buckets and

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,039
understanding how the site is

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,559
constructed and even getting an

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,559
introduction to the idea of

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,000
building pages with components so

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
key takeaways from this section on

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
identifying components are really

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,080
content first all the way and you want

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
to prioritize your components and your

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
templates based on the outcomes the site

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
needs to deliver

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
you can always make more components and

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
things there's always more things that

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,400
you could design than you have time and

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,640
space for

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,160
and so you prioritize based on outcomes

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
then you can differentiate based on

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,919
content structure and that helps people

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
scan

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,080
so once we've got that nice groundwork

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,919
laid and we've got the baseline and from

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,039
here you can actually start creating

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,320
uh so what we're going to talk about

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
next is actually how to build that

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,799
alignment across your team

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
so the key concept here is that it's the

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
content model that links design and

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,440
engineering

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,039
um so design systems serve content that

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,799
means the link between the designers and

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,480
the engineers the model it's the

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,240
hinge or the point of alignment between

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,320
the two practices

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
um so the the challenge is that a

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,320
content model looks like this

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
and we used to try to put this in front

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,840
of our clients to get their input

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
and ask our designers to design with

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
this in mind and it's just

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
too hard clients know how they want

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
websites to work

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
but they don't know how to translate

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
that knowledge into evaluating a content

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
model spreadsheet it's just not an

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
interface that they can really work

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,600
effectively with

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
and so it's up to us to frame our

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,160
questions in a way that clients can

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,880
effectively

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
answer and the way we found to do that

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,559
is sketching

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,159
it's the best way to frame questions um

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,520
not just for clients but for every

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
member of the team

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,720
to be able to sort of backpack ideas

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
back and forth on and

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
we've started pulling sketching early

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,039
early early as early as possible

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,320
starting some very low fidelity work

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
and what we've really found is that this

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,480
visual method has been really game

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
changing

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,320
for our work both internally as a team

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,280
and with our clients

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,919
so back to carl yeah so continuing on

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,159
the example uh that we're using for

00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,320
palantir.net

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,200
uh now it's time to get everyone in the

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,679
room and start sketching right

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
but being a remote first company uh that

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
doesn't actually mean we're all

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,640
literally getting in a room and

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
you know going to a whiteboard that

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,320
means we have to get on

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,559
video calls and use uh some sort of

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,039
virtual whiteboard to do this

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,559
we personally use envision freehand uh

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
for sketching

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,000
but honestly you can use whatever you

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
feel comfortable with or what your

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,919
client might prefer to work with but

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,919
that's that's specifically what we use

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,159
so for reference uh we want to look back

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,159
at our user flow

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
okay we've done this great work of work

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
of mapping out

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
what users uh are going to be doing

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
where the entry points are where their

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
touch points

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,440
points are and we can get a pretty good

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
idea about

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,280
what are the general templates or even

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,880
drupal content types that we're going to

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,440
need to be thinking about

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
as we move forward through sketching we

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
roughly know the components and the

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,200
content as well again we created that

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,600
content list we're starting to identify

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
narrative content versus data database

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,360
driven content so

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,280
we have that information stored as well

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
and most importantly we have a mapped

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,000
out

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,360
flow to guide us through the next sketch

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,679
the next steps of sketching

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
so taking a first look here at sketching

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,120
we

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
we basically want to start looking at

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,039
very

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,760
rough and kind of crude looking uh

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
examples here we want to be asking very

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,480
very simple and straightforward

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
questions to get

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
to the root of what people are actually

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
doing when they navigate through a given

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
flow

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,480
so we'd be asking questions with the

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,919
client with the strategist and engineer

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,200
and the designer in the room

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,360
how will the audience get to this

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
content right so maybe they're starting

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,640
from the home page and they click on a

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,799
certain button into

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
maybe a services page or maybe they're

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,880
bypassing that fully and they're

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,799
they're heading to uh one of those

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,799
interior pages directly from the side

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,880
door through a google search

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,360
um what did they expect to see first

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
next and last again we're giving a path

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
forward

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
of what they're what they're seeing

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,559
specifically from one page to the next

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
maybe they're having to navigate down

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,159
the page to get to information

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,320
um once they uh once they navigate in

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
and then also what is the final action

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
the user is taking

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,760
so again we want to be able to map the

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,200
full user user flow out here

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
but we want to make sure that we're

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
really capturing what the final

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,960
destination is what is the final

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,919
interaction that the user is doing

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,919
to make this a successful user flow

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,280
so very simple uh user flows at that

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
point

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,240
so once we've mapped out and sketched

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,159
out those user flows

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,679
we can start to bring a little bit more

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
fidelity into this as well

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,200
and really start to validate the page

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,679
level strategy

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,799
and we're wanting to ask questions like

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
is this feature

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
uh is this feature idea possible to

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,520
build with the data that

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,559
we have or how should this content be

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,320
interrelated

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
you know is this content going to be

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,080
connecting to another piece of

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,080
piece of content or is it going to be

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
strictly just information they can read

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,360
on this page

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,640
or should we move this content up or

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
down on the page

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,919
and again these are conversations that

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,720
you want to make sure that you're having

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,400
with your strategist and and client to

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,080
make sure that everyone's on the same

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,279
page because there might be something

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,480
that comes out of that where you

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,760
identify

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,679
you know actually we want to move this

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,600
featured work above industries because

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
it meets this particular business goal

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,039
or this kpi

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,039
conversion that we want to have and

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,120
during this step within sketching

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,039
it's really really crucial that we can

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
we can do that because we can identify

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,080
those

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
those key decisions very very early on

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
so as we go through that we're then

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
going to be

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,039
moving into the next stage of sketching

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
where we're dealing with a little bit

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,760
more fidelity at this point so

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,799
chances are you've probably already done

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,279
wireframes

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,159
uh you've maybe even done some comp out

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
work

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,520
and at this point within your sketch

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,440
session you're

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,039
really trying to validate the content

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,640
model okay

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,039
so you're going to be asking questions

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,159
like where is this content coming from

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,480
is it manual or generated how much

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,960
content should be listed on a given page

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
you can identify maybe there's maybe a

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,720
display of three

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
maybe there's four or five as well as

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
you know

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
maybe we want to have a two-up column or

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,320
a four-up column

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,159
these are great decisions to be able to

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,640
be had in a sketch session

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
um just because again you're getting

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,520
everyone involved in your

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
in your answering these questions um

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,360
without any sort of um issue with people

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,520
following along

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880
um you could also be asking questions

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,679
such as how structured

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
uh should this content be maybe it's uh

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
content that should be narrative

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
or data driven as well as you can be

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
thinking about

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,080
what is the experience going to be like

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,840
in the drupal administrative side

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,440
so you can start mapping things out a

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,679
little bit more

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
from that side of things as well so for

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,799
instance in this

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
example that we have we can identify

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,159
that we might want a curated list of

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,240
featured work

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,559
but the admin might want to be able to

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,200
reorder that information

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
as they see fit well we can simply

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,080
sketch that out

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,600
and provide kind of an illustration of

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,159
what that actually means

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
or we could even throw in a screenshot

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,679
of a drupal admin

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,600
uh reordered list to give them an idea

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,640
of what that experience might be from

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
the editorial

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,960
editorial side again it's really

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
important to be able to get the

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,640
the buy-in from the client at this point

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,480
of how they're going to be

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,919
interacting with the client not only

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
from the front end but then also from

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,400
the back end

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,200
so through sketching you know

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,520
we're gaining a lot of great information

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,919
a lot of great annotative information

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,840
uh through um note taking and all of

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,799
that information but now it's time to

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,880
translate

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
that alignment into the actual work that

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,320
we're doing

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,679
uh we're wanting to basically take all

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
that information that we're doing and

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,679
put it into the outputs of

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,159
how we're going to be writing our

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,760
tickets how we're going to be

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
creating our content model spreadsheet

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,480
so there's going to be refinement that

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
we have within that

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,039
and then also what is the final output

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
what is the prototype going to look like

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,440
as well

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,559
so for an alignment of the tickets one

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
thing that we found to be really really

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,640
beneficial

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,720
is how we name our tickets

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
uh so there's different disciplines

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,640
there's different

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,200
um you know jobs that certain tickets

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,200
will have

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,960
one might be dedicated to building up

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,480
the prototype one might be for

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
implementing it in drupal and the other

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,919
one might be theming

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,559
but what we found is creating a

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,360
consistent naming convention for this

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,080
really creates a consistent path all the

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,960
way through

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,640
and really kind of makes uh makes

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,600
everything kind of talk to each other

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,440
so so for instance the way that we name

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,279
uh components or

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,200
name a component is we give it a prefix

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,720
of component we get then give it the

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,880
name of the actual component name it

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,960
such as highlight and then we add

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,799
whatever discipline or role of that

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
particular ticket might have at the end

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
so

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,880
prototyping and implement implementation

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
and so on

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,799
so the actual information going on

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
within each of the tickets might be

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,120
specific for that given

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
role or that job that someone has but

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,480
they all

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,480
interconnect

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,360
and then what we also can start doing is

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,120
refining our content model as well

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
so we've done all this great work within

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,159
the sketch sessions to

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,120
uh build out shared understanding of

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,919
uh what particular components do where

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,039
where things will

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,399
uh interconnect and all that so all of

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,000
that sort of stuff

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,679
and from here we can start to refine

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
that a bit more and give a little bit

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,480
more

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,120
uh concrete rules put in place

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,679
specifically for the content model

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
um after all this is really kind of a

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,279
centered

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,720
a centralized kind of documentation

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
system that we use

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,399
where the strategist designer and

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,279
engineer can all reference this

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,200
this data the designer will need to be

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,279
able to use this for the actual

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,880
you know development of the markup where

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,320
the engineers can be building this in

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,399
the implementation

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,840
and then the client is also going to be

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,559
needing the the

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,240
naming conventions as well as their um

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
as they're kind of using the editorial

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
experience as well

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,919
so we want to make sure that

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,240
everything's consistent from the content

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,240
model

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,679
and then lastly uh it's it's really the

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,320
alignment of the prototype here so based

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,399
off of the tickets and content model

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,000
we can create a well-structured template

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
prototype that stays true to the

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,360
sketches that we first

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
started working on when everyone is the

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,200
room what was in the room

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,120
there really are no surprises at this

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
point when we have this prototype

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
the client's happy because they have a

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
display that

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,080
achieves the goals that they set out for

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,840
uh the strategy

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,760
the strategist and designer are happy

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,840
because of the user flows and the page

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,840
level strategy that we put into it

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,960
and the engineer is happy because we

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,480
have the code

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,799
that is um integrated within um

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,880
the prototype will be seamless as it

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,880
goes into the drupal implementation

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,760
so as we take a step back and look at

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,520
where we were

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,440
and where we are now you can see that

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,919
there's quite a bit of difference

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
between the display of these um both

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,000
essentially have the same

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,679
content uh but the new template has set

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,799
goals through conversation and through

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,360
sketching to

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,279
produce a much more refined experience

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
for the end user

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,559
going through the process of identifying

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,440
the job of the site

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,360
creating user flows for key experiences

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
and sketching for shared understanding

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,159
for team members

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,679
and the tasks they are working on

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,440
so yeah you know when it comes to the

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
problems that this approach solves it's

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,159
really about keeping the entire project

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,320
team

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,679
uh product owner designers strategists

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,360
engineers client

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,279
in alignment early through the entire

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,960
process this is also just a really

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,720
effective way for engaging our clients

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,559
in the editorial

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
question of how the site should be run

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,520
i'm sure everybody's been in that

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,120
position where the client has tried to

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,039
create something on a page and realize

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,559
it doesn't do with x

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,640
i don't see that anywhere near as much

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,720
anymore um from a

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,000
business owner's standpoint standpoint

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
it's very important to be able to

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,120
maintain alignment on scope and

00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,679
deliverables which this really helps

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,480
with

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,360
and just from a sure helps us keep a

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
shared naming convent

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,600
which makes content creation and

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,200
proliferation a lot easier

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,399
so our key takeaway from this is that

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,679
even though there's a lot more people

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,120
involved

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,559
it is nevertheless better and faster and

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,080
ultimately cheaper

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,919
um and that sketching is a really

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,840
effective common language that first

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,200
flow that carl showed is one of mine i

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,399
can't draw for toffee

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,960
no problem putting that stuff down is

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,679
much

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,679
faster to write a big document

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,640
explaining what my theory of a user flow

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,480
is

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,080
um and you know ultimately the end goal

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,840
here is that the client gets a platform

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,480
that works the way that they want

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,640
and expect in the budget that they plan

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
for

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,760
so this last little section is pretty

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,679
short it's just a quick look at how we

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,519
document our systems

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,600
um and the key thing i really want to

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,880
hit on here is that the design system is

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,960
giving your content admin sister

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
clients are using the visual design as

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
the guide to the back end editing

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,000
experience

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
today a little bit about the content

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,240
admin struggles with the admin ui

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,320
it's definitely been our experience too

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,480
so when content admins are sitting down

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,480
to create and publish pages having like

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,039
a picture of the ideal page in front of

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
them

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,760
gives them the context they need to

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,799
actually build out a good site

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,000
um you know we put all of this energy um

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,440
in this whole process

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,279
finding the goals and designing for

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
content and

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,120
user flows but when you hand off the

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,919
site to the admins who own and are

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,919
building it

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,360
they may or may not have participated in

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,120
that process

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
and that mattered less back when we were

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,080
using streams because they didn't have a

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,799
lot of choices

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,399
um so documentation was pretty easy um

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,360
but the thing is that a

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,360
cms admin interface is really good about

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,880
enforcing elements and components of the

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,320
design system

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,840
provide much pages and we want our

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,679
content admins to know how to use the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,120
design system to deliver the best

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
experience it can

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,960
so a palantir effect is called a style

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,720
guide

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,960
and we use real content to the extent

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,799
that we can which includes showing these

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,840
fully constructed pages in their ideal

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,360
state

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,279
and that's been a really big that's a

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,919
huge key piece of our documentation at

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,640
this point

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,320
um when i say blueprint i really do mean

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,360
exactly that like a component based

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
design system

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,880
gives your content admins a lot of

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
freedom

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,559
and providing page level blueprints

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,320
provides some basic code reels

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,000
and ultimately it's their content

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
they'll build them how they want

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,600
um and i don't know the way you sort of

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
think about it is it's like i can't stop

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,360
a client from

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,960
picking like a really ugly linoleum but

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,120
i can at least make sure that the

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,880
windows are in the right place

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,880
and this type of documentation helps

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,960
yes so documentation is important step

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,159
for once content editors can

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,640
access access the site and start

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
entering in content as well as once the

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,039
once the site goes live

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,760
they can use this documentation to

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,679
reference

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,440
what was done prior and just make sure

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,799
that they're building and structuring

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,000
content

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,839
correctly for the future so what we want

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,119
to do is we basically want to document a

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,200
lot of the work that we've

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,200
done along the way within this process

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,079
and the first thing is documenting the

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,800
the key template flows that we created

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,119
so

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,839
by by doing this what we're really doing

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,119
is providing them some guidance on

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,200
how to make sure that the that the um

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,919
that the content is structured in a way

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,800
um and really as intended for the user

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,960
flow

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,320
a lot of times clients will lose sight

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
of flows when they're working

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,639
um once we're once we're past

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,079
development and the site goes live

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,240
and they just start adding in a lot of

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,159
content but what this documentation

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,480
really does is it allows to give them

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,359
the blueprint or really kind of the the

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,720
way to

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
make sure that they're still in

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,919
alignment with those particular flows

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
that we felt were

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,000
very extremely important early on in the

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,240
process

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,240
what we also want to do is is really

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,920
document the component options here as

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,200
well so we take a look at a given

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,839
template so example

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,240
we're looking at a case study here and

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,240
really what this does is it provides

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,480
um just good definition around what's

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,280
available to these content editors as

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,880
they're ready to build out these pages

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,520
we provide basically a brief purpose

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,200
of of what this template is for as well

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,680
as laying out all of the different types

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,920
of components that they could be using

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,520
we also identify if it's an editable

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,920
block or maybe if it's a

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
generated block or something that might

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,520
be statically created

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,359
and again that just gives them some

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,680
insight in terms of if this is

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,599
narrative content or if it's being data

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,200
driven

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,280
uh what's also great about this is that

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,359
we're we're creating we're also

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,200
aligning with the naming conventions

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,640
that we came across early on within the

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,680
content model as well

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,079
uh with as well as within sketching uh

00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
so

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
for instance all of the different names

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,200
that we have from the components are

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,920
consistent with what we have within the

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,599
markup

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
which is consistent in the content model

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,880
and of course which is consistent within

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,960
the drupal

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
backend as well so when the client's

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,640
looking at this

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,000
guide they can see okay static block

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,599
that's the component name

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,760
if i go back into the administrative

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
area i can see static block is the same

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,640
exact

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,200
name that we have for this particular

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
component

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
and then lastly we want to make sure

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,880
that we're we're giving them a

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,280
a well um a well laid out

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
um prototype essentially to look at and

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
and to reference

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,560
um we use real content uh when we put

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,599
these together

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,680
really whenever we possibly can

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,000
and really what this does is it provides

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,920
a good blueprint for them to to know

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,440
how much content is really expected for

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,800
a given component

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,640
um we don't want to necessarily just put

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,079
in lower mipsum or

00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
have them kind of decide how much

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,800
content should exist in certain

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
components

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,240
because they might not be designed for

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
that so this gives a bit of content

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,920
governance

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,599
to the content editors as well as they

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,599
move forward once the site is live

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,359
all right so the problems this type of

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,040
documentation solves is that it

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,960
basically just

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,800
it gives a little bit more guardrails

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,599
for the freedom of a component-based

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
system

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,720
and it gives the content admins that

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,720
strategic context to

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,960
to make really the best decisions they

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,640
can every member of any team wants to

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
understand the larger context of their

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,800
work and this is a pretty good way to

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
get it to them

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,720
and uh yeah our key takeaways for this

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,320
one are really that the design system or

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,880
the style guide is the blueprint for

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
clients as opposed to the drupal admin

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,000
um that our content admins need that

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,079
higher level context

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,040
and that boy if you have real content in

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,960
your prototypes

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,320
it's a huge asset it removes a lot of

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,240
the guesswork and it's a lot more

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,359
accessible than like a million page

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
training pdf

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,960
so if you read one section if you're

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,720
coming back on this later

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
this is the top line is that building a

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,240
great design system requires

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,160
an interdisciplinary team you're going

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,000
to need a content person a design person

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,640
an engineering person and a business

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
person

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,560
even though that's a lot of persons it

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,560
is still better and faster and cheaper

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,480
so interdisciplinary team has to have a

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,720
shared

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,839
language to collaborate well so

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,920
sketching is the way

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,960
again we found that to be the best way

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,839
possible to do this

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,880
because it's fast it's low-fi and it's

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,640
really just easy for

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,200
everyone to jump in so if you do one

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,320
thing

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,160
uh specifically from the from from

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,760
watching this presentation is to look at

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,680
your process and identify

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,800
the points where you can slot in

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,599
collaboration

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,640
across your strategist designer engineer

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,839
and client

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,960
as early and often as possible we want

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
to make sure that we're sketching

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
together

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,359
uh we're naming things together we're

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,880
iterating together

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,960
trust me a lot of these people have

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,480
great great insights when it comes to

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,960
making a better product

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,320
so sketching to ask questions is the

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
common language that we can all

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
understand

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
and that is that so thank you i see a

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,079
couple of

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,440
like good like super awesome questions

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,720
popping up in chat

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,200
so i'm i'm just gonna start from the

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
bottom

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,880
up which is how do you get the client to

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
get your content before design

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,400
slowly and painfully is the answer to

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,400
that one it's very tricky

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,720
setting early expectations and setting

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,079
early

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,599
milestones we actually ask our clients

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,160
this most recently we've had most

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,880
success with asking them to bring

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,880
draft copy to a sketch session and what

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,400
you're doing is you're lowering the bar

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,760
for like it doesn't have to be done it

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,960
doesn't have to be approved you don't

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
have to run it through eight billion

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,599
people

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,200
just put something on a page that you

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,160
think is about right and we're gonna go

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,920
sketch with it

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,160
and get them in the habit of thinking

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,280
about it as like an iterative climb

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,800
instead of like it's done hand off

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,480
and frankly though it's still quite

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,319
difficult a lot of clients do like to

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,000
kick the can down the road

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:14,240
oh they do

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,240
what else we have uh let's see

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,760
um greg on the hour is a day and a week

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
of collaboration does that translate

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,079
into

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,760
i can give you a top line number but

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
what i can say is from a project

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,800
management point of view the way that we

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,560
plan the work

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,000
at this point is that it's like the

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,040
meeting the sketch session

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,640
is the work so we've got like the you

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,839
know here's the sketch session

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,760
these are the people that need to be

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,880
participatory this is the size of the

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,520
ticket

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,319
um and so it's not like an add-on to the

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,720
work it is

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,160
the planned work itself so it makes it

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,000
much easier to incorporate into

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,119
budgeting it took us a while to to hit

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,720
onto that

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,560
but that was like a real game changer in

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,720
terms of like managing it from a project

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,640
management point of view

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,400
there was a question here for how long

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,520
did it take you guys to end up with

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,640
this refined process the answer is

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,560
long time yeah i mean it's the the thing

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,040
is is that a lot of it is trial and

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,839
error

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,319
and uh just iterating upon things that

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,119
you know

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,760
work um coming across the sketch session

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,400
piece was

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,240
was just something that just happened

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,119
because we wanted to get our ideas just

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,280
out on a board

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,720
so being that we couldn't work together

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,319
in a single room we had to find some

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,800
other solution to do that

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,480
and we were finding that internally that

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,920
was making a lot of sense in in order

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,359
for us to kind of

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,280
get to answers faster as well as

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,880
posing new questions that we weren't

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,240
maybe thinking about if we were in a

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
different type of medium

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,520
and really all we did was open that that

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,119
gate a little bit more

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,160
into uh into um getting the client

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,640
involved so

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,359
um yeah this refined process has taken a

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,280
long time

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,800
um but uh it's working well

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
and i saw a really good question of

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,880
thread about um

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,560
this is from chris green how do you

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,839
approach creating a design system for an

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,520
enterprise that has many different

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,920
groups with so many unique needs

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
that is actually the etf problem um

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,880
that's the first design system that we

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,119
showed that's a

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,000
the wisconsin department of uh employee

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,560
trust funds

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,599
uh so that's when we actually did a top

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,440
task

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,640
the first time we did a top task

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,480
analysis

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,000
um and we've since incorporated into

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,560
virtually all of our work

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,079
because it really does help like they

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,839
understand like identify the actual

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,920
tasks people are trying to achieve

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,400
and get them into a priority ranking

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,400
that matches people's expectations

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,920
and this is really interesting because i

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,359
was in a really good session today about

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,359
this where people were talking about

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,000
using personas

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,440
and my experience personas of limited

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
use in this space

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
what you want to think about is clusters

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,800
of intent or

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,040
tasks like what are people here trying

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,720
to do and what's their mental map for

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,319
where they would look to do that

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,319
thing so a persona

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,440
reasonable people can disagree but i

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,079
think about that one is more of like a

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
brand

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,920
thing like if you're trying to convey

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,599
like tone as opposed to if you're trying

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,880
to like understand like how to organize

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,079
information

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,880
one thing i'll add to that as well

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,079
within the um the goals matrix map that

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,119
we were showing earlier

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,319
the audience goals really depends on

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,079
you know what what audience you're

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,680
trying to serve we do identify different

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,359
types of audiences that we're we're

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,359
dealing with but we're really

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,560
looking specifically what what is the

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,240
outcome that they're looking at what is

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,040
the task that they're trying to achieve

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
within this

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,400
and that's enough for us to get the ball

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,400
rolling in terms of

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,079
really identifying what are these key

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,079
user flows that we need to worry about

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,560
uh carl you want to talk about one about

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,560
the design assets

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,520
how do you store your design assets and

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,599
share them with the client for review

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,599
so design assets uh we

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,640
when it comes to design assets we we use

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,720
envision for for presentation purposes

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,400
we just like freehand there's there's a

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,599
suite of of different applications that

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,880
you can use and one of them

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,280
is basically display your information um

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,000
or display your presentation information

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,680
uh through

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,520
through one of those uh particular

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,640
applications within envision

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,200
uh so that's how we we typically have

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,119
them

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
um see it within the presentation but

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,480
then also they can do inline commenting

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,160
within there as well so we can have a

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,680
collaboration with them

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,560
in terms of of kind of a feedback loop

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
essentially with

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
with that

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,520
um there's a question in here

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,359
on have you ever given a client a

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,200
shopping list of components for them to

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,760
choose from to make it easier

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,760
um the answer is no um because

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,760
what we're doing is we're we want to get

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,319
them focused on what we're trying to get

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
achieved

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,000
through this page and so our team knows

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,520
that list of components but we don't

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
give the client that list of all the

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,200
card things to choose from

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,040
um largely because like it's not their

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,720
job to know what components do the best

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,240
job it's our job our job is to make sure

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,440
we really understand what they're trying

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,760
to achieve

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,440
right um

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,520
how detailed is the design system

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,280
documentation carl you like are so good

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,599
at documentation i'm going to

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,359
want to talk about that one briefly do

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,000
you add anything behind which elements

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,240
and components

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
to use and for which cases and scenarios

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,880
etc

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,119
we go a little bit further in depth

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,240
within our style guide

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,520
um so it's kind of uh an appended piece

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,119
of the documentation so the

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,040
documentation is really more of kind of

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,760
like a broad stroke kind of

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,720
recommendation and outline of user flows

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,079
templates and

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,400
components we do give a little bit more

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,160
um guidance within the actual style

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,440
guide though where we can actually

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,440
give a little bit more details

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,920
specifically within that we use pattern

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,319
lab as as our style guide um

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,960
vehicle to kind of deliver this stuff

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,280
and

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,800
again there's there's like there's

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,400
basically kind of like a developer's

00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
notes area that we can fill out with in

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,319
there where

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,000
you can explain a little bit more

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,599
specifically on on

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,680
um kind of build governance

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,640
um and i'm sort of popping around so

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,079
sorry but paul

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,599
i see this great question about like

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,040
don't want to be overly picky but i

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,880
think of a design system is something

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,480
that sits on top of a set of sites as

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,800
opposed to describing the overall design

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,400
architecture of a single site or project

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,680
that may be a labeling description i

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,319
will tell you straight out that like

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,240
i've had

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,160
many a conversation about these exact

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,240
definitions of terms

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,240
i know one of like the big divisions um

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,760
that i've experienced talking to folks

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,839
is really the difference between like a

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,800
cms or like a platform

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,640
versus a like a like a product or an app

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,400
where you might have like 10 screens or

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,200
five screens versus like thousands of

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,200
pages

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,720
so one of the big conversations that

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,319
i've been a part of is

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,040
what's the role of content in a design

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,640
system at all and what we're really

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,800
the the stance that we have chosen to

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,359
take over here is that it's it's central

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,200
that that design is about meaning it's

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,400
about conveying meaning and helping

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,720
people

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,000
learn and that trying to design in the

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,640
absence of that content

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is sort of not as effective as if you

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,920
design with it

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,240
um but you're completely right that that

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,280
is a larger conversation and that terms

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,079
are

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,440
proliferating and maybe not used

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,440
identically across practitioners

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,880
one question here from david luke do

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,800
your designers have a

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
working knowledge of how the editing

00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,400
experience in drupal

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,040
works and how it looks how much does

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,079
that help in the high fidelity design

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,480
so we do we're not specifically uh

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,960
drupal developers our our design team

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,119
although i do have experience actually

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,960
theming and building within drupal so i

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,079
have a bit of a unique experience from

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,440
that perspective

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:49,280
but we do want to have the designers

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,839
pretty well versed in terms of not only

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,200
terminology of drupal so views content

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,119
types all that kind of stuff but also

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,680
what does that editorial experience look

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,800
like

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,119
and that's also something that

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,800
strategists within our team are really

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,480
familiar with as well because again we

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,520
want to make sure that the editorial

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,720
flow for the users

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,079
is is really uh really tight and working

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,079
for them because again

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,200
uh it hinges on that on on the

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,280
successful the

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,040
the success of a project if it's a pain

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
to build

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,480
for the for the for the content editors

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,079
and for the clients then

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,400
i honestly don't think that we've done

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,400
our job

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
i see a question from sarah where do you

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,160
store the list of components and

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
elements and have a common ground for

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,280
design

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,520
designers and developers so during the

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,400
builds like before the site is live

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,400
the source of truth for like a better

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,720
term is the content model

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
um and then once it's built it lives in

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
the style guide itself

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,200
um so it's like here's your list of

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,559
components news developments etc

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,880
but during the build it's the content

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,880
model

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,480
what am i missing

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,559
oh have you ever had to create a design

00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,400
system for something like a distribution

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,000
any recommendations from planning design

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,640
for many sites and mixed content et

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,280
cetera

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,359
we have and that actually also starts

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,200
smikety smack with the content model

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,520
is what we found um in this case it was

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,559
a

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,119
they needed a central repository

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,960
to feed like i think it was like 10

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,160
products across like a huge range of

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,000
devices

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,400
um and a lot of what that boiled down to

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,920
is like okay what needs to be shown

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,680
on any given device because they're used

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,640
in really different contexts um so this

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,480
is a medical

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,760
context so if you're a doctor you're

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,200
trying to explain to a patient what's

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,960
happening you need a different level of

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,880
fidelity than if it's just like

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,160
a slide going by in a waiting room or

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,640
something like that

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,599
um so it was actually like quite similar

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,359
um and

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,520
i think yeah i mean we we always kind of

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,640
it's like what is it what is the job

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,400
um and then you can kind of like

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,240
extrapolate up and down the types of

00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,920
components you need based on like how to

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,880
do that job in the context

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,880
if that makes any sense

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,079
um i see a whole bunch of animals in the

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,000
slide deck so good

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:15,359
i'm glad the permissions got sorted out

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
um so many nice things you guys are

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,000
saying thanks

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,839
oh i think we might have got them all

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,319
there are too many how many components

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,319
are too many

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,520
um that that depends sarah

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,760
and too many components uh

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,559
we have at least one we have at least

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,880
one that has like over a hundred easily

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,720
but in fairness that's serving both an

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:55,760
institution of higher education and a

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:57,520
hospital system

00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,079
uh i don't know about envisioner very

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,000
wxd carl that's that's a you question

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:07,680
um envision versus adobe

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,680
xd well we use sketch instead of

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:14,400
adobe um instead of adobe pro

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,000
suite uh just because we we've we've

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,599
used it for years and we're just kind of

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,640
familiar and used to it and as as well

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,280
as it integrates

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,000
well in terms of getting our assets from

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,520
sketch into

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,280
envision there's a plugin that we can

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,680
use uh but

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,680
also envision has the freehand

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,240
application which we find to be really

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,559
helpful

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,079
for kind of that free-form sketching to

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,680
be able to just kind of get in there

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,200
get your hands dirty and just get your

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,119
ideas put to

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,640
the whiteboard and uh

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,640
oh how do you get designers getting

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,559
comfortable with sketching

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,079
that's probably a car question too i

00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,760
know i can't draw so i'm just like hey

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,040
guys

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,480
i think it's kind of harder for

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
designers to show things that are less

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,480
polished

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,599
yeah it actually really is in fact i i

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,319
i i tend to to get a little too focused

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,839
on the the

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,240
the things that aren't important in a

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,760
sketch session so i have to refrain

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,359
from from trying to go a little bit too

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,520
deep into making things

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,280
perfectly aligned and everything but

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,599
luckily freehand does give you

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,319
just enough tools to make you know those

00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,559
types of

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,440
uh alignment changes and different

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,160
things like that but

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,079
it's pretty bare bones so you're kind of

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,400
you're kind of set to just kind of deal

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,880
with

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,160
with things not looking amazing and i

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,880
think that's what what makes it great

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,240
for everyone to get involved

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,520
um and from sarah was there difficulty

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,960
in changing your process to be

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,680
cross-collaborative and how is that

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,599
handled

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,160
i mean yes and

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,400
um it's sort of iterated over time like

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,680
the sort of original idea of like

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,280
we started sketching and we like this

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,559
this is actually for etf we're like hey

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,040
it'd be really cool if we could do this

00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,240
thing

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,520
and we sketched out this whole thing and

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,480
everybody was really excited and then

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,599
brought the engineer in

00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,559
and the engineer was like that would be

00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:01,200
cool it's impossible we're like oh

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,200
we need to link we need to like tweak

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,240
this process so that we don't run into

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,319
this problem

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,960
um so it wasn't like we went from like

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,960
zero to like here is the full flowered

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,800
process so much as like we tried

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,640
something it worked pretty well

00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,920
we talked about in retro and we brought

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,000
some more people in

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,400
and sort of it's been sort of growing in

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
that way

00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,760
we do work remotely like pound here is

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,359
actually remote first we've been remote

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,559
first for three years

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:35,359
more than that now so um it's actually

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,359
really nice because uh it's kind of

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,559
sketching with clients like on a

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,839
whiteboard and things like that is

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,599
really important and helpful on

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:46,000
discovery

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,319
and uh discovery doesn't last very long

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,440
so

00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,800
it's nice to be able to have the

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,480
sketching so you can kind of pull them

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,480
back into that collaborative space

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,680
and uh it did help when we all had to we

00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,000
didn't have to go remote we're already

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,880
there

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
made it a little easier

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,440
all right going to the groups of intent

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:14,480
oh what a good question that is

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
i have to read it let's see

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:25,520
okay i think what you're asking is that

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,280
um when you've got different

00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,040
like sometimes like sometimes we're

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,839
fortunate and like we have one client

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,480
sme who can be present and can stick

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,000
with us

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,119
but other times there might be times

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,839
where it's like actually this is this

00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,680
like niche

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,440
piece of the business and we need to go

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,720
talk to a new expert

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,400
um i think that's what you're asking

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,240
like how do you manage that and the

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,000
answer is yeah you absolutely do have to

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,880
pull in like a subject matter expert in

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,599
that moment

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,280
um and this is actually where

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,680
identifying your flows

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,480
like quite early in discovery is really

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,359
critical

00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,960
because um what that lets you do is

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,559
avoid a problem where you're like

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,079
i need to talk to the subject matter

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,599
yesterday and they're like well okay

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,799
that's a vp you can't talk to them for

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,960
like two months

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:08,400
um but if you if you have those user

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,720
flows up top

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,160
then you can plan it out you can be like

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,440
great i need to talk to ex person and

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,720
they're like well you can't until

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,720
october and it's like all right then

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,720
we're putting on the get in october

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,079
um so you it's just easier to plan

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,599
everybody's time and you're not like

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,000
constantly like trying to yank new

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,240
people

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,839
in and so that's like a really huge

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,280
benefit of identifying those

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,880
business goals and the user flows up

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,040
front because it helps everybody plan

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,559
their collaborative time

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,720
yeah we actually put this into practice

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,440
on a recent project already where we

00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,839
were

00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,960
needing certain subject matter experts

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,400
in a certain call

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
and because we've outlined within the

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,960
user flows when we're going to be having

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,440
those

00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,599
discussions we could plan to have them

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,160
come in at a certain time

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,680
you know whatever week that was and uh

00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,040
what's great about it is that you're

00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,079
you're going into a virtual

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,920
whiteboarding

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,079
you know session with them they don't

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,680
necessarily need to participate in terms

00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,400
of sketching or doodling although

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,480
they're more than

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,640
happy to do so all they have to do is

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,799
follow along we're still controlling the

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,920
conversation we're sketching things out

00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,440
and a lot of times we already have

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,920
something to present to them within

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
theirs

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,040
as well we've probably done some

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,599
internal iteration

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,160
on on some sketches that we want to

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,720
basically

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,160
validate with them and at that point

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,599
they're really just kind of following

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,920
along as if they were watching a

00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,920
presentation that we were giving

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,280
and they're correcting us as we go i do

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,400
think that's important and one of the

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,200
things that we're actually going to talk

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,240
about in

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,960
exhibitor hours at palantir.net is how

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,400
to set up

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,760
sketch sessions because what you can't

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,880
do is just like welcome to the

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,400
whiteboard

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,160
sketch like you actually have to like

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,119
set up the session like and facilitate

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,640
it and there's

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,559
different ways to do that at different

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,680
points this gets to this next question

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,119
about how do you collect

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,440
such extract the intents beforehand

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,400
um and a lot of that again like goes all

00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,960
the way back up to

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,440
discovery um where you're talking to

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,599
your

00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,799
key stakeholders about what their goals

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,240
um tap tasks

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,559
is really becoming a more and more

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,160
integral part of our process because it

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,520
kind of cuts through the chaff

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,079
of like this is what people are coming

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,400
to your site to do like

00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,359
there it is um and that helps too um

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,880
like kind of like

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,160
so you kind of like pull up the business

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,920
and the audience goals and start

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,640
aligning them very early

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,079
um and that helps you um put together

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,000
some hypotheses

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,599
of intent essentially and then like a

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,599
lot of the sketch sessioning as carl

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,839
says is about validating that

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,119
um and sometimes like the sketch session

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,799
is like is a lot more like a

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,520
presentation and sometimes it's like oh

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,440
no you guys

00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,200
missed a really key point and we have to

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:41,119
like kind of crumple it back up

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:42,319
you want to crumple it back up sketching

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,160
all right that's a lot of questions

00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:46,720
these guys um

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,480
well over so probably we should release

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,280
everyone back into the wild to play

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,720
trivia

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,319
um but yeah if you want to talk more

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,880
about this one if um please do come to

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:57,839
our exhibitor hours at palantir.net

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,359
and carl is going to play the guitar and

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,000
i'm going to draw really badly

00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,000
