we also i mean do a lot of work with

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
cloud native architectures

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
automation and cms integration and

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,560
talking about cms integration

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
mostly on decoupled projects either

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,799
wordpress or drupal

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,399
with the uh using a front-end strategy

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,439
as gatsby or next year yes

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,439
so again it's moving again make sure you

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,439
i mean ask questions whatever you think

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,399
is important to take care

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
and also you know like tweet about it

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
something you

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
see here it's makes sense it's

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
interesting you know

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
i'd love it i hate it let me know and

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
before jumping into the session i just

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
want to

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
mention this show the screenshot this is

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
from

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
dre's presentation about drupal persona

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,879
and he mentioned about

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
the five different like personas that

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
interact with a drupal site or with a

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,680
drupal implementation

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,200
and uh and he mentioned something like

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,440
you know we have back-end

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,959
developers you know the uh developers

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,519
that

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,599
spend most of their time working with

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,879
drupal you know building modules

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,200
and and doing custom custom code

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
and you know like really dealing with

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
drupal i mean as

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,200
a back-end work most of the work i mean

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,760
that i recall i start doing

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,080
drupal for so long then we have

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,080
front-end developers or designer

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
and and for each one of those personas

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
he mentioned what would be a good i mean

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,159
to do on the on the upcoming version for

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,200
back-end developers you know

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,720
improve api and you know replace all the

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
hook system with events which

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
i mean that sounds awesome you know for

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
front-end developers you mentioned

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
something about like modernize

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,080
javascript either introduce react

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,159
components and view components and well

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
take advantage of component-based means

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,519
systems

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,720
he also i mean another persona that was

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
mentioned in this i mean it's very

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
common on the triple world

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,080
and maybe it's not that common in other

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
cms's and then this is

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
might be because how drupal works you

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
know allow you to do a lot of site

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
building it means

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,920
going to the interface and create add

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
features you know

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
create construct a content model so i

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
mentioned like i mean maybe

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
having automatic updates will be great

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
and there are more modules in course

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
just kind of take advantage of i mean

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
some of the uh

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
well-known modules that are on the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
contribute space and

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
it should be great to have it on core

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
um well we have like content creators

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
and yeah i know i mean there's there's

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
coming like front dev is different than

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
designer but yeah he was trying to like

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,360
group into

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,080
into this i mean um categories to

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
show what would be a good fit for them

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
and which initiatives would be nice to

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
have

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
well we have content creators you know

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
people that go to drupal and their

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,400
content and for them

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,320
something good we're having like modern

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,199
i mean admin ui i mean remember there

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
was

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
an attempt to do that and now it's like

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
a whole idea it's

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,720
start little by little i mean make it

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
easier to i mean

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
to use like page builder tools you know

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
like layer builder

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
might be i mean better interfaces for

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
interacting with paragraphs and the blog

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
system

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,560
and when and and last but not least you

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
know sellers you know

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,720
like having a better look at admin team

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
will be easier for them to sell

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
projects you know like a lot of i mean a

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
better integration with third-party

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
tools

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
now let's start with the with the agenda

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
of this project i mean

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
i just didn't mention that the first

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
like i'm just go

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
i'm just going to revisit at the very

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
end of the session

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
and let's say and now the agenda we're

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
going to talk about web development and

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
jump stack

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
static content decoupled ripple hybrid

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
approach with gas fee

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
and providing protected content you know

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
behind a user authentication

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
and finally i mean might be there it's

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
possible to use

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,120
i mean gazby to provide now that

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
already have the user authentication

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
provide a

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,479
or allow to user to interact directly

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
with drupal and update content and

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,160
profile

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
and that's that's doable and we'll see

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,960
how this looks like

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,000
well let's start talking

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,280
about the web development i mean

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
in general i mean if you've been

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,520
where i mean working with web

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,280
development for a couple of years back

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,800
and you might be working with the what

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
is called the traditional monolithic

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
stack

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
so it means it's a monolithic

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
application

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,960
as drupal as wordpress or other cms's

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
that out of the box provide all of their

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
features you know like they provide a

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
database for starting content they

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
provide

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
a template layer for rendering content

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
they provide

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
forms for users to go to the app and

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
enter content

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
and well when you are using this

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,280
monolithic

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
stack what has happened when someone

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
visit your site

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
you know there is someone loading a

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,440
browser and then what happens you know

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
that call

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
gets you know trigger i mean to a web

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
server

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
and that web server it should

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
communicate back to your i mean

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,759
applications in this case to drupal then

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,960
you know

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,120
gets data from the database and drupal

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,520
send that data back to the team layer

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,240
then all that markup markup that gets

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
rendered

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
and finally the page gets built and that

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,000
page is the one that gets served

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,120
to the visitor of your site so it means

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,479
your user

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
have to you know have to go for all this

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
flow

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,000
in order to visit your page

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,039
and what is happening here is we have

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
a this monolithic server right so this

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,400
server application or there's

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,520
within the stack which takes care

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,319
of most of the load of the i mean of the

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
uh

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,000
workload for this on this call right

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
from your client visiting your page to

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,280
the web application to

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
serving the html markup so it means all

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
of the

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,880
most of the work it's done server side

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,639
and

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,880
i mean by default every every single

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,360
person visiting your page is gonna get

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
you know

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
triggered that process but obviously i

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,639
mean obviously we don't want

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,039
that to happen because every single

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
time that we go to the database we go to

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
the server

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,360
i mean we load assets i mean all that

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
process i mean it's

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
it costs time and money so i will i mean

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
their drupal

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,599
provides several several level of

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,440
caching mechanisms and also your your

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
hosting provider it also takes care of

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
like you know

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
i mean providing an extra caching layers

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
to

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,599
serve i mean save you from hitting your

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,120
back end like several several times

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,199
and you know then all these you know

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,800
javascript frameworks that start showing

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
up and i'm talking about like

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
five six years ago you know whenever

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,360
backbone

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
show up whenever you know like amber and

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
then

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,640
there was a huge movement about single

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,000
page applications so it means

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,719
we ship the full processing to client

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
side

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
so instead of you know your client

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
asking to the server and the server

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
providing the full page

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,720
i'm already built i mean the client was

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,360
asking your server for data and the data

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
was

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,640
returned back into json format then the

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,680
client you know your client in this case

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,600
your computer or your i mean um

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,760
i mean mobile device or

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
whichever the device visiting the the

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,839
page it was the one

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
who was responsible for building that

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,920
markup so i mean although all the

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,399
template

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
system it was client-side so again

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,880
you're going back to the server the

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
server was an api

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,320
exposing an endpoint returning your data

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,640
and then you take that data client-side

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,920
and and build and you know i mean it

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,000
and that's mighty provide you like a

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,600
better performance

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
perception but again you were probably

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,440
consuming a lot of resources from mobile

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,839
consuming a lot of um memory

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,360
draining all those batteries and and

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
maybe when you're visiting

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,640
those sites with the computer i mean

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,640
it's fine but when you start

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,240
you're seeing i mean mobile devices for

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
that it's kind of it's not getting a

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
little i mean a little more i mean

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
i mean it requires more resources from

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,200
your device so now

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,640
how this turned into an aesthetic i mean

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,560
i mean static uh side generators i mean

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
new era that we are seeing here i mean a

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
nice new era because there's a lot of

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
hype of that but i mean

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
the state side generators are i mean are

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,640
being in the market for so long like j

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,399
cole and and other other tools and

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,040
what's the difference between

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
this modern stack you know the jam stack

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,720
approach

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,720
compared with the monolithic approach so

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
the workflow for someone visiting your

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
site

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,160
gets like reduced to something like this

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,480
i mean there is

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,839
a visitor loading a page and

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,800
that page it gets served by a cdn

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,240
so and that page has all the markup

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,839
already pre-rendered so

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,040
it means it was a um a uh

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,279
previewed process

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,519
that already takes care of creating all

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,000
the market for you and then your visitor

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,760
it's it's only have to go to the that

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
cdn which is basically it's gonna

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,560
serve that content i mean via

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,320
geolocation closest to his i mean to his

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,880
where he's connected from

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,279
and he will be able to load the page

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
like really really fast

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,120
but how how is this page already

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
previewed i mean where is the database

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
where is my drupal where is the backend

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
i mean

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,399
what happens here it's instead of having

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
most of the processing

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
within the uh the main server you know

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,200
that it's

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,079
like providing the uh the api

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,880
endpoint so we have another another

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
another

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
machine in this case called build server

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
and this

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
is the one this build server is the one

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
who takes care of

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
or is responsible for build running that

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,760
bill

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
so it means it uh there is a bill

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
process

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,880
that it's get executed because something

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
happens either like clicking

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
something or because there is a module

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,079
from drupal or wordpress plugin

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
that triggers that particular i mean i

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,279
mean

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,360
uh process or might be a content change

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,959
on your cms trigger this

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,399
this build process but what happens with

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,440
during this build process is

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,839
this build server or this build machine

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
i mean has a way to connect to your i

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,440
mean to your

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
i mean server your backend server and to

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,600
that particular

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,720
api and fetch content from it and then

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,399
run a process for pre creating or

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,880
previewing all your markup

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,760
and then all your pages are already

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
rendered

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
and then the final result is that page

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
gets

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,480
deployed to a um

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,560
a cdn so your client it doesn't have

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
only have to go to the cdn and the cdn

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,639
is going to serve that

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,440
the page and i know there is some cases

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,079
where you need the api client side when

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,040
you need to like consume like live data

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,600
and well you can keep your api alive but

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
at the end

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
like let's say eighty percent of your

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,240
page or 90 percent of your page like

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,000
headers and footers and layouts and all

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,040
the you know sidebars everything

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
could be still previewed and then only

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
fetch what it's

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,800
new or only fetch what it requires to

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
get fetch client site

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,639
and again the benefit of doing something

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
like this is your content is already

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
rendered so

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
your you mean your clients visiting your

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,360
page are i mean

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
have a better experience because those

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
pages load faster

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
because markup is already there there is

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
no like rendering process it was run

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,800
before the server and that render

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,839
process it was run only once

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,399
per build or per deploy

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
and some of the benefits and we can see

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
from from this

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,959
jump stack approach it's it's a better

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
performance again

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,800
you only are serving and consuming flat

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
files

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,800
so there is no back-end there is no

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
database there is no web server doing

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,880
load of your pages so again performance

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,199
is better and your sites are more

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
reliable again there is no backing so i

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,199
mean

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,480
there is no problem with you know it's

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,880
cause something is gonna happen you know

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
like

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,839
i will have like a hundred of visitors

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,000
and then i have to increase my

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
you know the uh the the power in my

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
machines you know providing more

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
resources

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,199
i mean that doesn't happen because you

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
are serving

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
you are serving like flat files right

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,720
and it's more secure

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,399
i mean for obvious reasons you know we

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
don't have a a

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
i mean website i mean we don't have a

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,800
and uh you know apache or engineers we

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
don't have a backend we don't have a

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
database

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,440
i mean that all those systems

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,880
could live behind a firewall it could be

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,160
locked behind a firewall

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,000
so only i mean editors or people

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,360
adding content or interacting with

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
content can access to

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,279
and also you know the build machine who

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,920
will be like consuming the api

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,600
and and and the final result is hosting

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
is cheaper because you're only hosting

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,639
files

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
you can get those files and drop into a

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
cdn

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
or or you use i mean i mean a hosting

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,680
provider

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:55,040
with it has support for this i mean

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,560
this kind of i mean of

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,160
i mean artifacts deploying these

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,360
artifacts you know this which is

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,600
basically

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,040
uh a bunch of like html files

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,199
okay and how drupal makes sense

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,199
i mean i know this is static thing right

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
okay i was talking about okay we moved

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,320
from the melody approach to use

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,199
something like more simple manila and

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,199
well

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,800
it makes sense if you start using

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,800
something like like gatsby you know

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
and all these jumps back you know this

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,880
young stuck

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,839
i mean

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
i mean approach it's it's make a lot of

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
sense with something like that because

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
guys we

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,680
allow you to run this build process i

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
mean seamlessly

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
but what is gatsby for those that are

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
not aware

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,639
and and might be saying godzilla is a

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
static side generator because maybe

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,360
that's how they

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,519
like sell at the early beginnings of the

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,920
project but i mean nowadays we can say

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,480
gaza

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,079
is no longer an aesthetic generator and

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,959
based on what they

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,639
have on their site they set you know

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,120
gatsby.org

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,800
or they said gusby is a free and open

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,600
source framework

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,399
based on react and well that allows you

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
to developer

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
you know develop building like lazy fast

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
website application but again this is

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,240
important it's based on react

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,079
but more than a react framework we can

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,720
see gatsby as a react

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
application that allows you to create

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,800
react

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,240
apps so again and that's

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
and this is how everything is going to

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,639
start making sense so when we are using

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,759
ghastly we can take advantage of the

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,560
the what they call the content mesh

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,920
and this is something like let's try to

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,920
scrape the content match it's going to

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
make something like gatsby allows you or

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,880
you know it's a mechanism for

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,839
pulling data from different sources

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,079
and and allowing you from a single

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,920
source of truth for that for that data

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
that is coming from different sources in

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,680
the case of gas leak gatling again as

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,279
was mentioned in galvester react app

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
that allow you to fetch data from

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
different sources all those different

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,360
sources could be

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,000
a i mean a drupal graphql endpoint or

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
a wordpress graphql endpoint or you know

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
a

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,439
arbitrary graphql endpoint or you can

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,799
fetch data from air table

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,880
firebase the mongodb or you can even go

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
and as far as say you know i don't need

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
a i don't need

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
a backend system for this particular

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,000
implementation so you can

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,439
load content from files you know you can

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,079
load content from

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
from markdown files or go a little

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,240
further and use

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,520
mdx which is basically jsx

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,480
slash react files inside markdown

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
static files or you can even provide

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,919
more

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
constructed data by using you know

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,840
something like

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,679
json files or jamon file but again gavi

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,840
allows you to

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,799
fetch data from different sources then

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,760
creates this

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
graphql endpoint in memory that you can

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
query

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
and you can use to create your pages so

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,039
during this build process

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
that is happening that is provided by by

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,000
gatsby

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,200
you can create different pages on your

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
site

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,640
and then the final result is a react

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,120
application which is only a

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,080
build directory with a lot of i mean

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,799
flat files

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,760
that you can now deploy to a cdn what is

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,480
happening here is

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,520
now you have the artifact that you can

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,200
deploy to a cdn

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,600
and you no longer need to i mean

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
access content directly from an api if

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,799
you're only

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
serving a static file i mean if you

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,120
don't require two people to

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,120
authenticate in your in your page in

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,840
your system right in your

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
site sorry

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,080
okay so okay now let's think about how

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,840
can we use drupal well i mean

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,559
we can keep using drupal but in this

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,960
case we can use drupal as a d-couple cms

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
and

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
what is a decoupled image you know it's

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
a content management system

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,679
that makes your content accessible via

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,840
either a restfully i mean restful or

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,000
graphql api in the case of drupal we

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,440
have json we have json api module and

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
graphql module

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
and allows you to i mean and provide

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,960
this content i mean

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,200
or make this content accessible via

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,919
those endpoints

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
for you as someone implementing your

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
site can

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,120
consume those on any device or to any i

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
mean application it means you can

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,679
access that data from a mobile device

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,240
you can access the data from the cli

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
you can access the data from your i mean

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
front-end application

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,120
in order to build your pages

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,039
but now we can set well we can ask

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,080
ourselves i mean why why we should i use

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
drupal i mean there's

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,400
plenty of like i mean headless cmss or

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,480
decouple cms's i mean

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
at this very moment you can decide i can

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,720
probably switch to wordpress because it

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
provides a

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
you know here it might be a easier i

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
mean

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,840
user i mean in a rush i mean i mean

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,440
graphical interface for users i mean why

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,720
why we still want to use drupal in this

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,799
case i mean we want to use

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
drupal magic because we have we

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,760
currently have legacy sites you know we

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
have plenty it's maggie this is

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,720
government or this is education

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,039
and we have a lot of sites and we want

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,559
to keep using those and okay it's a well

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
i mean it's a bell tested and well-known

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,520
ui

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,640
allows you to i mean create like complex

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,960
data structure

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
i mean and in this case i mean being

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,559
more i mean

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
having like creating like notes adding

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,440
paragraphs media taxonomies i mean

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,039
that's

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
pretty standard with your drupal sites

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,360
and allow it allowing you allows you to

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
use

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
do a lot of like content management and

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,280
workflow capabilities right so

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,799
that's a good reason for using drupal

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
and why ghastly right i mean

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,400
there's another project yes i mean

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,960
there's next yes there are some other

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
i mean like other projects and what i

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
mean allows you to provide data from

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
different sources

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
allows you to connect to third-party

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
services

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
provide you with a better developer

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,559
experience allows you to iterate faster

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,039
you know and deliver like better work

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,880
and you know another benefit of using

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,760
this decouple approach is the separation

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
of concerns

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,559
you know for running people you can hire

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
foreign people who takes care of running

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,039
tests

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
and you can keep using your back-end

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,799
developers to taking care of the

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,880
back-end

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,760
work so now now let's move into

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,000
okay now if we already have a back-end

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,240
system like drupal or decouple system

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,640
can we use this for providing like my

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
more dynamic content and the answer is

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,080
yes we can provide

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,200
hybrid pages like using slides i mean

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,520
client-side calls

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
an example of this is think about a

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,919
search

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
page from your site maybe your site is

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,640
full of static and you can probably use

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,360
something like

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
lunar to provide client-side search

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,559
whatever you have

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,600
a lot of records and you don't want to

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,799
load all those

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,039
i mean notes with data as json

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,679
in memory or what you can probably do

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,320
here is enable you know views

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,640
in solar which is drupal and graphql

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,799
views and expose that view graphql

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,080
and now you can provide within your gas

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:03,520
beside a little you know

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,960
input where users can type i mean type

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,919
what they are searching and

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,559
that via you know a client-side call we

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
can get

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,720
that i mean that i mean

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,600
text that user is trying to search go to

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,880
drupal

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,240
i mean via graphql a graphql call

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,200
and and again that

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
endpoint is exposing your views and your

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
abuse is connected

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679
to solar and solar is taking care of

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,039
doing all the indexing and whatever

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
solar is great to do

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,799
and again it returns all the results

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
back to client

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,640
to your react application and then you

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,320
take render client side

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
and you take care of client side

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,679
rendering whatever you need to run

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,039
either you know the thumbnail the text

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
and link to whatever

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,799
so how this looks like again how can you

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,720
achieve something like this

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,200
well you have to add a view and expose

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,799
data find site

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
you have to connect this view with solar

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
with your solar engine

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,799
to enable graphql views module and

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
obviously from your react app you call

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,000
that that

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
view and i mean from the drupal setup

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,840
thing is

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,600
going to be used i mean once you enable

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,559
the graphql module the view module you

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
will have this

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,799
display that you created your user your

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,400
view is already connected to solar and

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,159
it works i mean you can take advantage

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,520
of all the knowledge you already have

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,280
and you know it works another

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
hybrid or a dynamic approach could be

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,240
something like a blog post think about a

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,039
blog post let's say

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,400
we have five records or let's say we

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
have hundreds of records but we only

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,200
want to show

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,320
five on the first page but maybe i'll

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,039
run a deal

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,000
like you know monday and today is

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,039
wednesday

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,840
and there are two new blog posts

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,120
on the site and instead of running or

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,760
waiting for

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,360
running the build to deploy your site

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,720
what you can do here

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,840
it's load your page load your static

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,159
render page you know the uh let's say

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,960
from the 100 from a thousand records i

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,840
just want to load

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,440
five to make you know my page load easy

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,799
i mean easier and faster

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,840
and then i will do a client

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,760
call but i will only fetch new notes

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,200
starting from this particular day that i

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
know i run the build

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
what is gonna happen here it's i'm just

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,640
going to

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
hit my my back end i'm just going to

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,360
fetch those new records and i'm just

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,039
going to use those together with my with

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,080
the other i mean

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,279
records that i have i mean on the on the

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
bill

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,760
that i got from the build process i can

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
i mean get both set of data you know

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,640
merge it to one single set of data and i

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,840
i can start rendering my page so again

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,120
i'm only going back to to my

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,200
back end to fetch latest i mean notes

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
i mean that were i mean that got created

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
after the last build

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
and from the rest of the pages i can

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
probably you know create

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
all the pagination so instead of

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,440
rendering like hundreds of pages like

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
page one and page two and page four

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,720
because i mean that

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,640
it will probably consume a lot of build

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
time so instead of doing that what we

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
can probably do here is just

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,679
get the get all that content into json

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,880
files

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,640
deploy to my cdn i mean on my build

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,600
process and then client side

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,360
the appliance i think i mean doing once

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,000
i start navigating next page

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,960
next page or page i mean x number what i

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,880
can do here

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
it's called that particular json file

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,600
that was already deployed to my cdn

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,640
and consume the client side from this

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,679
static file

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,159
and again the benefit of doing this is i

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,240
mean

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,200
the first client cycle is only if new

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,440
content

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,320
if new content was entered and published

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,039
you know

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,600
using the decoupled cms uh after the

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,200
last build execution

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,720
all the content that has already entered

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
in publish i mean

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
i mean the on the build time on when

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,000
you're running the build

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,919
it will get i mean render aesthetically

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
and you know and you can provide

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,919
pagination as i was mentioning

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,919
via this i mean json files i mean

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,039
already deployed on the cdn

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,520
okay so let's now let's move to

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,400
something else now let's move into

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,279
building

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
or using gas v and react to build

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
something more like an

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
app

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:24,320
and we can do something like this with

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,520
cosby yeah you can do that so think

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
about this

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,200
we want to provide user authentication

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,159
and we i mean we want to allow users to

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,840
i mean authenticate to identify them and

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,559
provide either like

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,880
like uh personal personalized features

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,600
or

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,679
private content so this could look

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,600
something like this you know i have

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,960
this site this is my drupal slide this

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,080
is my gallery site

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
i can go to this protected content and

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,000
as we can see

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,080
here so we have this uh

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,799
login to read full article so it means

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,640
if i go here and say you know busy tour

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,480
visitor and logged in

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,679
a new piece of content is gonna show up

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
you know here he's gonna tell me you

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,200
know this content

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
it's um

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
and live demos is when

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:25,600
and let's refresh the page first

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,480
refresh the page and then okay now go

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:35,039
again

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:37,440
and go visitor

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,440
log in

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,480
and yeah i can see this content this

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,640
this is a protected content it means

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,159
my bill i mean my build task it only

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
takes care of rendering you know

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,919
image takes care of rendering this but

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,760
this piece of content is protected

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,120
behind user authentication so this

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,200
is provided via a client-side call

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,559
to the backend in this case to drupal so

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,679
it means

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,679
like 99 of the page was pre-rendered

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,919
previewed it was fast

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,200
and only this little piece that is i

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,480
mean protected

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
it's it was called via coincide and

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,279
and within drupal this looks something

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,840
like this so we have you know again our

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,760
content page saying instead of showing

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
that particular piece of content we show

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,960
this like login to read full article

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,799
once you log in you just saw the

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,080
you show the the particular piece of

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,840
content and again

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,360
it's not like the content is hidden

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,200
somewhere and

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,440
and how we get that i mean we just get

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
this by using drupal

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,039
roles the system so we can allow you

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,399
know this particular field it's only

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,960
accessible by this

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,600
visitor in editorial it means gasby

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,880
which is

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,720
the user that we use for the uh

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,559
build mechanism doesn't have access to

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,960
that field so that field won't be

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,039
available on real time so it means even

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
if you try to add that to your graphql

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,440
query

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,200
you won't be able to get that data

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,520
because drupal is not allowing

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
to the gas the user again that is the

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,840
one using real time

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,080
to access that field

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
and then client side you are logging as

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,279
visitor or

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,559
editor and then again now you have

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,919
access to that field

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,279
you client side do the call and

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,240
you get the uh you get the data

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,919
that is coming from drupal in this case

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,919
via graphql i mean query

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,880
and now let's keep moving let's do

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,440
another little demo let's see if this

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,760
goes faster

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,640
what if i want to provide you know a way

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,279
to update my profile or you know update

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,679
page or publish the page and and might

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,080
be

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,840
providing an improved workflow can i do

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,679
that and yes you can do that

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,960
and what will be the benefit for doing

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
something like this you know allowing

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,799
users to review

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,440
and publish content directly from gazvi

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
or even

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
allow users to update content from

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,679
gasoline how this looks like

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,960
so let me go back here and i'm just

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
going to log out

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,840
and again

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,360
this is my site so let's say i'm just

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,320
going to

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:24,080
load articles i don't know why this is

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,080
running so i'm just gonna

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,120
run my gatsby develop again so i'm

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,240
running guys be on my local machine as

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,760
you can see here

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,880
and i oh i'm also running drupal on my

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
on my local machine

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,360
here and so this is my drupal site that

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,559
gatsby was it's consuming to

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,240
providing content and also to uh

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,679
render the site so the build process is

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
running here the cadbury developer

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,279
is running here and now let's see as we

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
can see here we have

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,240
content you know like home web jumpstart

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,760
whatever

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
and it's running so slow it's coming

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,159
it's coming okay

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
and what is going to happen we will see

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
how can we update content from

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,559
one side to the other and we can update

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
content from you know from drupal

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
and get reflected on gusby and the

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,919
opposite you know

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,840
update content from gusby and get the

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,840
update on on drupal

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,000
so yeah there's a question now

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,799
yeah i mean like if you don't want to

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,320
use an inventory hybrid approach you can

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,559
use triple continue yeah you can

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,000
you can instead of login from uh from

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,799
react app you can just

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,559
that log i mean log into or send the

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,159
user to log into drupal and update

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
content we'll see how how this looks

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,559
like so again

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,919
i'm loading my gas beside it's coming

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,120
so now i'm going to log in as a editor

00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,320
as an editor instead of uh

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,519
instead of a um

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,080
editor instead of a uh visitor

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,840
so once i log as an editor i'm just i

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
mean you will see a little change on the

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,320
site so a little toolbar is happening is

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,960
shown here so let's say i'm just going

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,000
to go to

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,880
articles and going to

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,159
load my so this is happening because i'm

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,559
loading client site

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,320
not because so i'm i have the you know

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,720
the approach that i mentioned you about

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,240
you know having a client side call and

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,960
now let's log the

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,200
page and now take a look at how this get

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
here get in touch so i'm going to get to

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,720
this

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,480
page that is the web application

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,919
development

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,039
go here go edit and i'm just going to

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,880
update drupal

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,799
and we'll see how the change gets

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:56,480
automatically i mean

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:58,559
we have live preview out of the box here

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,760
i don't know why it's things long so

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,240
you're here

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,200
and that's the side side is built with

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,559
basic fields

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,720
and and in this case we have a few

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,559
paragraphs which is in this case we have

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
this text image paragraph so what i'm

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,679
going to do is change this

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,960
scissor field hit save and what is going

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,000
to happen here

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,120
this say it's going to trigger the

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,240
refresh on my godly site so i mean what

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,559
is going to happen here

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
i will see this we will see this text or

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,399
we should see this

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,919
disappear yeah the teams looks like

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
larry the team that we are yeah it's

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,320
gone

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,480
it takes the theme i'm using it's not

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,000
lara it's gene that is based on claro

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,679
so okay now let's say now i was i was

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,519
able to update this because i was

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,679
already drupal but what if i just

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,559
i haven't logged into drupal i can just

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,120
click

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,679
this edit i mean action and then might

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
be

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,080
loading the the drupal site and from

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,440
there i can edit and you'll provide the

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
same experience that i was providing

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,519
previously

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,480
which is good but what if what if

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,120
instead

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,679
if i want what i wanted to do it's to

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,760
you know

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,760
update from my godly side so i can go

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,560
you know click publish here

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,560
what is going to happen it's i mean

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,639
obviously drupal doesn't have this

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:20,320
refresh so i have to like reload my page

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,960
and we will see how this web development

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,879
content it's gonna show unpublished so

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,720
now it's in publish here

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,639
and i can go back to my drupal site and

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,560
and make changes from there if i want to

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,040
or you know because i mean in this case

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,879
i am i'm publishing this this content

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,320
because i don't want this to be part

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,639
of this particular build because

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,839
something i mean you go on ground i

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,760
don't want you this to be

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,119
as part of the of the build artifact

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
that is going to get deployed to

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,800
production so i can go here

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,760
one maybe i want to make or instead you

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,960
know maybe

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
it's someone push the content as none as

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
not

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,879
published and i don't know this looks

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,760
good i can i change something do i click

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,920
edit

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,119
i can go here you know let's let's

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,560
remove this little piece

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,079
here and hit save and let's you know

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,079
this little paragraph

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,640
should be better as well so i'm just

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,119
going to take this piece

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,920
and and

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,400
see let's change something else hey i

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,800
think i

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
kept cancelled so sorry i'm just gonna

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,520
get this one

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,960
hit save

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,000
and if we go here to back to drupal

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,960
and as you see it disappear we need to

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,480
again reload the page to get fresh

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,000
content because the page was loaded

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
before i edited

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,119
edit on gasby but it's going to happen

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,079
now

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,920
if i go edit we'll see this is providing

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,200
whatever i'm just telling here

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,200
and the paragraph content it's it's was

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
updated so now finally let's remove this

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,520
one from here

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,680
it's published hit save and

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,040
and again i can keep moving things from

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,800
one side to the other

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,560
and and i'll see here

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
it's coming it's gonna slow

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,880
and let's see why it's not coming

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,400
yeah let me refresh let's see that

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,200
something's happening you know live

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,280
demos but again as you saw

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:30,240
you can provide this app this react app

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,240
within your gazvi um

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,560
gatsby uh develop process which means

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,119
you are running gas via

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,680
on develop mode so before i'm triggering

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,520
the deal

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,599
you can you can go to your gas make

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,839
changes you know i mean

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,079
approve approve content i mean change

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,280
the status of the workflow of the of the

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,000
status of the content

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,160
and and finally publish the content if

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,720
you want to and and what we just saw is

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,280
i mean

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,599
you are providing a user i mean you are

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,680
providing a way to users to authenticate

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,160
they can either go and update their

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,119
profile or their preferences

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,240
and within your react app you can also

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
allow them to make

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,440
changes on content you know like you can

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,200
just

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,720
i mean just use something simple as

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,280
publish on our published content or

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,560
maybe

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,839
i mean enable i mean a or implement

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,800
a a content workflow and you can

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,760
change those statuses from from your

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
from your august

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,119
site i mean i mean this happens i mean

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,040
on when you are running your gazville on

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
your development stage not on your build

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,119
part

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,640
when you build i mean on your build

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,640
instance and

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,680
some other features you can provide from

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,240
here is either maybe

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,320
run a build from here or deploy to

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,000
production you know to or to another

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,320
stage that you can see you know the

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,160
final result so and you can interact as

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,960
much as you as you as you can

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,079
as you want and you can take advantage

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,760
of modules as you know

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,359
build hooks from drupal so what you can

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,760
do from your galvey site it's

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
called you know a endpoint and that

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,960
endpoint can

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,960
endpoint can take advantage of bill

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,280
cook's module to trigger

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,640
that particular build to i mean the

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,640
stage of content to

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,000
to either netlify or you know or

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,920
pantheon or

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,960
you i mean or your i mean cdn

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,720
and again finally you can provide

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,760
a way for users to interact with your

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,240
site via a login mechanism and then

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,960
allowing them access via their role on

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,520
drupal

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,280
so they can update content and that

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,000
content could be fields could be like

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,480
paragraphs

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,760
and you can also update like i mean

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,079
upload files or

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,920
update media i mean that's that i mean

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,359
justin wasn't part of the scope of the

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,240
demo but that's that's that's totally

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
doable

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,359
and just to finalize you know the

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,720
remember that drupal persona

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,240
screen that we saw i mean what if we

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,839
think about something like this you know

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,640
like the back end people the back-end

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,920
developers

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,839
i mean they can probably keep using

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,200
drupal you know front-end designers and

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,040
front-end developers i mean sorry

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,720
designers and foreign developers

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,480
they might be gonna start using you know

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,000
something like like gasby

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,680
they can take advantage of things like

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,839
storybook to create those those

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,040
components and then use gaddy to render

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,599
those components

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,520
and how about site builders i mean

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
drupal out of the box provide a lot of

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,400
features that

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
might it's better to stay on drupal you

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,800
know like like content like site

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,599
building

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
i mean content modeling enable views i

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,320
mean that's that's good to keep in

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,560
drupal

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
for content from for you know like like

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,040
content creators

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,839
myvi we can start implementing those as

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,320
react

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,480
i mean components and have it on on a

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,400
gusby side or on a neck side

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,640
or or me my view and have it on gridson

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,640
and for sellers well now they can have

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
you know drupal it's it's

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,000
it's a really nice tool that you can use

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,359
either some monolith i mean we shouldn't

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,359
monitor approach or

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,119
a decouple approach you know it's out of

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,280
the box the integrations with

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,440
with projects like front end or you can

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,200
implement

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,560
and foreign so i mean this is something

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,240
like you can probably i mean

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,160
i'm just trying to map what the drupal

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,319
person is to to the uh

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,599
to in a decoupled world so i think we

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,520
have five minutes for questions sorry

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,160
for taking so long

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,560
and question let's go jump to the

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
questions

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,319
okay i'm just gonna read those questions

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,359
uh okay why can't we use

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,640
bra gatsby with drupal

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,839
json api is or we need a

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,520
graphql well you can use vote i mean

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,400
whatever is your preference either json

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,400
api or

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,960
graphql is up to you so that was for

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,280
renato

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,440
okay should i there is a way that i can

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,160
see i mean the questions only questions

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
on this

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,880
chat or the moderator has taken notes of

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,079
those questions or should i just jump in

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,839
to answer

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,839
whichever question that i saw

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,520
okay should i just answer any question

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,760
how i saw

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,839
and can artifacts be built

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,160
speed of the build process or only

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,920
updated specific artifacts okay

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,920
so i think you might be asking about

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,319
yeah you can configure gatsby to build

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,800
only pages that

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,079
where content got changed you can either

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,560
i mean make your life easy

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
and use you know gatsby cloud system or

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,160
you can

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,440
configure your your build pipeline too

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,520
and you know the proper

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,560
at the proper flags and configuration

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,960
and and

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,319
try to mimic what they provide with on

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
their platform but you can

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,880
definitely run artifacts and only build

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,599
pages that change where content was

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,839
changed

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,200
and that allows you to save you from

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,839
time for building like you know just

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,839
like your full site all over and over

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
again

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,040
uh dana uh stay purge bill hooks looks

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,280
like what my team has been talking about

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,880
meeting for two years now it's there i

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,800
mean so i mean you have any questions

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,800
let me know i mean also i mean

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
if you have any questions feel free to

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,560
send me a message

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,599
and directly or you know twitter or talk

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,040
about this or i mean

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
or during the session i don't know

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,720
there's a networking area i don't know

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,560
if there's like private rooms for

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,760
for keeping the conversation maybe the

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,119
organizer have a better

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,160
idea of of this than myself

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,520
and gather internals yeah use redux

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,119
exactly it's just redox

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,119
and so with modern stack you use two

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,319
hosting servers one build server and one

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,960
for the drupal site

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,480
well you can use i mean you use uh two

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,599
hosting servers well

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,079
you know the build server it's could be

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,800
like

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,440
you know created on the fly you know as

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,760
a build system you know something like

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,960
like circle ci or you know or github

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,359
options or whatever

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,640
but the final result yeah you need like

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,119
two hosting

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,520
i mean spaces one for the backend and

00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,560
one for the static files

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,960
and i think you can ask pantheon state i

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,880
mean

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
purge i mean did a session they are

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,760
working on

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
and we're working with them and

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,960
providing you know like this this

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,240
whole experience in one single place

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,040
and gerardo i believe as soon

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,200
as soon as you add some dynamic things

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,920
into your static system

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,640
you will lost something so i will argue

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,400
that even if

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,000
cosby is handling the authentication you

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,760
already lost something yeah i mean it's

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,560
not like you lose or miss something i

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,880
mean

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,960
in the end you know your page you can

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,680
still be like 99

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,880
of your page and only delegate that

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,280
login part

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,040
and and only let's say provide either

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,480
personalized content

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,960
or you know or or i mean protected

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,440
content

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,880
within that particular piece but i mean

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,560
the perception of

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,160
speed could be the same because you

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,920
delegate that process

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,440
because react allows you to render and

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,119
delegate that process

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,119
until it comes and then what the data is

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,520
comes then you rehydrate your component

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,800
so

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,760
again let's say your page is a component

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,079
that is compound by different components

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,000
and

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,680
one of those components is fetching data

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,560
dynamically so let's say from

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,079
you have ten components nine of those

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,880
are rendered aesthetically

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,359
and only that single piece that require

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,520
i mean

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,280
authentication and client-side content

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,400
is the one that will beget

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,599
rehydrate client-side so you still can

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,160
provide a good experience of any

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,280
performance

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,319
and i mean and i know building a full

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,560
form api on on react it's kind of

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,000
a complex task and and we are aware of

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,200
that but i mean it's

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,640
might be it's a chance to like

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,040
provide a uh a minimum set of fails or

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,440
or

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,200
you know forum and capabilities within a

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,400
react app to interact with with our

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,160
backend in this case

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,599
and another benefit is if we decouple

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,359
this then we can switch

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,720
the back you know switch the button at

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,520
some point and you

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,079
just change the layer the middle layer

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,000
from

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
interacting with the back with or back

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,040
end and switch that to

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,680
instead of having these graphql

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,079
mutations calls to drupal we can

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,000
i mean change those queries to interact

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,040
with mutations with from

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,160
to a wordpress site or to our own

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,160
custom application

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,000
what about your experience like web

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,640
forms okay

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,480
whenever you need to store data you know

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,520
like i mean or you're required to

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,680
interact with the next

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,520
with with this kind of situation like

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,200
forms or comments

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,640
ideally you should use an external

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,400
service

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,079
to do that in this case you can still

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,720
use drupal as a

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,200
you know as an api where you can push

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
those

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,440
forms you can push those comments allow

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,319
drupal to process those

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,079
that data and expose back to an api and

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,640
then consume on your static site and

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,480
again

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,240
you can do a similar approach you know

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
whenever you build your site you can

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,599
load

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,160
all those comments and only new comments

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
i mean

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,839
added post build fetch fetch those i

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,319
mean client side and

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,079
and and again anything that requires

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,000
server side processing

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,119
you can move that you can move dos

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
process to

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,280
ace i mean two it's external api in some

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,079
cases like

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,800
serverless cloud functions can can take

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,000
care of those

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,000
of that functionality

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,880
okay how long does typically take for

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,800
fetch content

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,640
to show on the site after updating

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,200
directly on drupal

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,200
um well i mean as you saw it's pretty

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,839
much it's a few seconds when you change

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,280
something

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,520
on drupal and get i mean refresh on on

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,119
on ghazi for some reason my local

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,640
machine is like have given me a hard

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,079
time because it's a demo

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,560
and i'm doing i'm in troublecon so

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,839
that's why it was slower than expected

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,040
and for some reason also

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,119
when you're using like you know this

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,640
video tools like either zoom or in this

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,280
case hopping

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,200
and and you're on os x then seems like

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,839
cpu goes crazy and

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,359
i mean a lot all of the resources to the

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,079
video processing and the rest of your

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,119
computer

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,400
start behaving a little strange and slow

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,400
but it's kind of fast okay

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,319
and tim looks like lara but wasn't clara

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,990
was jin

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,220
and nothing

00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,220
[Music]

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,079
are you losing any jump tech benefits if

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,720
drupal handles login burst of the jump

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,880
stack no

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,590
i mean you don't again most of your site

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,280
is still static

00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,640
[Music]

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,040
lucas i mean i already answered that and

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,040
simple

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,000
i mean answer the question about

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,839
authentication yeah

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,559
simple you can use simple out for doing

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:52,400
this jw3 is another option

00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,640
if you don't mind i have a hybrid

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,520
approach you can let drupal continue to

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,440
handle login yes you can do that

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,720
in production you should use a tested

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,319
and robust i mean

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,839
solution i mean solution to handle

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,040
authentication yeah you can do that you

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,680
can use out0

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,160
you can use firebase you can use i mean

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,040
i mean

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,760
aws have zone so you can rely on on

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,160
those i mean

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,000
on those i mean systems to allow i mean

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,640
user interaction and you know login and

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,119
managing login

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,280
authentication tutorial and i think we

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,160
can cover most of the questions okay

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
another one

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,680
maybe algolia will be the word for you

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,079
yes i mean ideally

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,880
if algolia will expose an api that you

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,520
can call

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,160
from your search box it will do the work

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,280
for you

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,319
jim yeah uh

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,760
i'm not trying lunar mass paragraph okay

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,280
yeah

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,599
it's talking about loaner having having

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,200
luna for client side called i mean the

00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,960
probably the issue with lunar or

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,960
client-side i mean searches

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,800
when you have a lot of content start

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,559
getting a little more complex than you

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,760
expected

00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:02,800
and i think we are done

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,079
i am again i am not sure if any of the

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,800
moderators is going to jump

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,200
say this is done or what will be the

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,200
approach

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,960
i'm just going to stop sharing

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,880

uh sure i will share the car and the

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,520
code is not

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,760
in a shareable state yet it's kind of

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,920
dirty and and and

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,599
but we will try to we will create a

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,359
repository that we will share with all

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,599
those examples and

00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,200
and and practices we have developed

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,000
during the process of implementing

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:09,839
decouple

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,839
i mean doing the couple implementations

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,960
what is lazy yeah okay right and it's a

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,520
cms project we were working last year

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,280
and gonna

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,640
revamp this year again so pick me

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,119
it

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:35,119
long story short blac ms it's an

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:37,359
uh it's a hybrid cms allowed you to do

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,240
it's allowed you to manage like content

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:43,119
like

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,119
it helps you to do or use as a um

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,440
git based cms but it also has a decouple

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,040
