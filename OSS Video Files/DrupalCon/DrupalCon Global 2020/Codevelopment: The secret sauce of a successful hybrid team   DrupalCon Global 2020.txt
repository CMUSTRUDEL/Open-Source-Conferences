for a very long time

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
since drupal 6 actually slightly earlier

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
but

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
in any case i work at newell brands i

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
lead the cms development team

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,320
and newell brands we're a global

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,200
consumer goods

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,119
company that has over 150 well-known

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,600
brands that are in households everywhere

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
uh sharpie papermate prismacolor elmer's

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
rubbermaid yankee candle just name a few

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
uh i'm sure everyone probably has some

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,479
some form of one of our products

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
in their houses and as i said uh newell

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
has been around for over 100 years

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
it's a company that has uh grown through

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
acquisition

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
most recently through jordans back in uh

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,960
and free free covid we were all based in

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
hoboken

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,479
it's uh our headquarters have recently

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,680
moved to atlanta

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
uh but we're hoping at some point we'll

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
be back in the offices uh but as i said

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
newell brands um

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
really is at the forefront of consumer

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
consumer package goods and really kind

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
of

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,800
delivering uh experiences to consumers

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
and making sure they're connected with

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
them

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
so i can uh get back and tell you a

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
little bit more about you want to know a

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,760
little bit about the project

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,120
as well so i can give you some sure so

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,519
some context on it

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
so about uh three years ago newell's

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
leadership decided

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
we have a lot of different data silos

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
and different

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
technology stacks we want to consolidate

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
all that and make it so that we can

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
really efficiently and and quickly

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
change as we need to to meet needs

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
of the market and so we set out on a

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
basically a digital transformation

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
journey and building a best-in-class

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,319
uh product and we built a platform with

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,640
drupal

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
uh as kind of the centerpiece of it

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
being the cms

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and we also connect to other systems

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
with that platform including

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,959
uh salesforce commerce cloud we have a

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,040
digital asset management

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,120
system as well so a lot of different uh

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
pieces to the platform but uh ffw

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
was heavily involved and brought on that

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
as our implementation partner

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
to really help us with with the rollout

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
and builds on that thanks for the

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,680
overview steve

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,040
lindsey sure i'm lindsay padlett

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,720
um i've been working with drupal for

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
about 12 years now i'm

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
the architect on the cms team on steve's

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
team at noel i've been here for about a

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,120
year

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
and my role in the project is kind of

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
interesting because i came out as an

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
architect

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
as the project was kind of midway

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
through um so i was kind of

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,239
a co-architect with um alexi after the

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,680
project was started

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,599
alexi hey guys i'm alexi gorbett

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,959
and uh i'm a group architect at uh fmw

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,439
uh i'm in drupal for nine plus years

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,439
and uh yeah on newell brands uh i

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,080
started as an architect and then we kind

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,360
of

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,400
shared the role with lindsay having our

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,640
own kind of

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
specialization in different parts which

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,319
was kind of cool collaboration

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
thanks alexei justine hi everyone i'm

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
justine hersh i'm

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,400
program manager here at ffw um i've been

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,639
working in drupal since around triple

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,199
five so it's been a little while now

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
um my kind of role within this

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,040
particular project was really working

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
very closely with the new group you know

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
we had a

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,320
uh a lot of sites and a lot of uh

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
different partnerships so really part of

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
my role was kind of looking a little bit

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,680
outside of the day-to-day

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
um working primarily with steve and

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
other stakeholders just to kind of

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,400
understand any trends we were seeing

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
um particularly things that we were

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
seeing that may be taking us away from

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,199
the direction that we wanted to work out

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,240
thanks justine uh steve our first

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
questions for you

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
um can you tell us a bit about the

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,639
newell team

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
landscape pre-project and also what the

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
vision for the team was

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,840
and you know why you embarked on the

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
project in a co-development fashion

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
sure so our internal team at newell was

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
relatively small when it started

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
we had just a front-end and a back-end

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
lead and

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,960
a couple of developers but it was really

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
it's a smaller team so we knew that we'd

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
have to work with the implementation

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
partner

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,720
to really you know bring this project to

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,479
fruition and i think

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
one of the things that we wanted uh was

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,720
a partner that had a lot of expertise

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,919
in developing obviously not just on

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
drupal but also

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,280
working with e-commerce and also we

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
knew that we wanted to uh really have

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
kind of a cutting-edge best-in-class

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
approach

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
so we wanted to use components and you

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
know

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
figure out how we could really uh make

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,880
ourselves uh

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
flexible so that as things moved on we

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
could change if we needed to and that we

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
could really

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
leverage the best of everything and so

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,440
as i said we expanded our team

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,160
working with ffw and uh so alexi's team

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,800
uh really had both a presence here in

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
the

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
u.s and then also uh offshore in moldova

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
and so it was interesting having to kind

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
of coordinate the different different

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
right

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,800
and then the ultimate goal was for

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
not only the teams to work together but

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,759
also for the ffw team to

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,440
educate and help the new team grow so

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,360
you eventually could achieve full

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,199
independence on the sites correct

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,880
correct i i think exactly so there was

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
the kind of the build phase but also the

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
transition

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
where you know we were really uh taking

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
over the day-to-day

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
uh development and deployment of the you

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
know of the sites and um as i said it

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
was it was

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,240
uh great in that the technical leads

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,440
uh with exception of one were all uh on

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,039
uh our same time zone so alexi uh

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,120
his front enemy as well as internal new

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,520
little front and leading back in the

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
we're all here in the us and that really

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
helped with uh with the oversight that's

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
great

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
um so justine that actually brings me to

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
the second question i would love to ask

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
you

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
so when we're thinking about resourcing

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
this team you know the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
strategic plan is set the agreements are

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
signed everyone's ready to work together

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
when we're thinking about the

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,080
team composition on the ffw side what

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
qualities are you looking for

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,039
in a team that not only can build but

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,199
also you know help educate and mentor

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,120
and empower uh you know what are we

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
thinking of in terms of skill sets

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
talk to us about the team sure so yeah

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
we really wanted to put together a team

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
that would both obviously be moving

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
forward with the development goals but

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
really meet some of these other goals

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,800
that we have kind of getting that clear

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,319
architectural vision

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
um getting alignment with the

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
stakeholders but also you know the idea

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,360
that we want to help renewal team grow

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
so that they can take this on um so what

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
we really did was again kind of look at

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
this as roles and specific key roles so

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
you know steve has mentioned a lot of

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
the leads we did actually have in the us

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
we actually had the advantage of having

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
some of those be west coast because we

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
were looking at kind of ways where we

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
could help kind of

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,199
extend our working day as much as

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
possible we had some aggressive goals

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
that we wanted to

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
to achieve um but really looking at it

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
through that layer

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,160
uh so say exam again for example my sort

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
of role was really looking at

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,039
what could aid us to um uh make the best

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
progress we have and kind of looking for

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,720
trends for impediments

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
alexi was very focused on again the

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
architectural vision making sure that we

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
were tightly aligned both with lindsay

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,319
but also all of the other teams

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
we have a lot of integrations and many

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,120
different pieces here

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,960
so again we wanted to make sure that the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
person in that role was a great

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,599
communicator a great collaborator and

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
obviously

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,879
you know very highly skilled in their

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,839
architectural area

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,519
um we also again in kind of terms of

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
looking to manage the team

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,320
we had a huge offshore presence across

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
both moldova and ukraine

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
and again really for those we were

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
looking for as always you know

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,839
enthusiastic and talented developers not

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,800
just in drupal we did quite a lot of

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,680
work in js

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,279
using a lot of the js frameworks um but

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
for a lot of it it's also the

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,160
the desire to collaborate so

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
you know whilst the skill sets and the

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
core skills are obviously really

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
important with the team

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
when we're looking at teams like this we

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,839
know that collaboration is keys we're

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,680
always looking to ensure that we're

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,720
building that good collaboration

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
ecosphere across

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
each individual team member as well as

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,399
the combined teams as a whole

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,800
one thing that was really interesting

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,640
about the plan too justine was that the

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
the leads were actually going to roll

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
not off but down

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,880
uh and uh you know where the the the

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
teacher then becomes

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,640
uh the developer and i thought that was

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
really cool too

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
um so this next question is for steve

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
and alexi

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,000
um what did your individual teams do

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
to set up for this co-development

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
initiative

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
so what are the initial steps you two

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
were taking on

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,000
your independent sides to be able to

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,000
turn these two teams into one

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,800
well i i think we had a couple of things

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,600
in place i mean one is that

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
we used an agile process uh safe which

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
is

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
uh scaled agile and so we uh made sure

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
that we had

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
you know good road map because of our

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,519
product backlog understanding what we

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,839
were building

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
and and making sure that as we uh kind

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
of brought

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
team members on that they were familiar

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
with it and that

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,959
you know we didn't really waste time to

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,480
hit the ground running one of the things

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,839
we did which was really helpful was how

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
we organize the teams

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
so we tried a couple different

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,839
structures at first we tried you know

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
okay do you want to organize

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
you know front end and back end and

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
figure out how everyone do that and

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
the end of the day we wound up uh again

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
it's not necessarily agile but

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
being one one big group but it seemed to

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
be most most effective and as i

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,519
mentioned before

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
having the oversight teams all in the

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
same time zone

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
really helped but also i i think the

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,800
fact that

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,920
we had a pm for the offshore team as

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,000
well as a pm

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,279
uh on site and then having as i said

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,360
justine and

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,640
newell's own program teams as well

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
really kind of helping to manage the

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
process

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
uh that helped us kind of make a

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
coherent

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,079
kind of group and beyond that absolutely

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,480
alexia what's your dad

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,680
sure i think what helped was we kind of

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
organized a hierarchy of

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,959
responsibilities and

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,800
we were trying to funnel uh requests and

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:11,279
basically organize the work around uh

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
like priorities for the project so there

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,040
was a great

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,120
like boards we could pick from but there

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
was also a communication gap considering

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,880
we're working

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,560
a bit across time zones so we did have

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,920
like a back-end lead

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,160
uh back in moldova and uh and me uh

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
kind of funneling through the requests

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,839
to him and also the front-end lead

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,200
was a separate person so having support

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,000
was very important as uh looking at

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
the main area of architecture and

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
actually

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,320
setting up the baseline for the for a

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,120
platform

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,279
it was very important not to get carried

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,079
away with the smaller details that could

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,240
be

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
delegated so setting up this structure

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
was important and to be clear

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
this wasn't we didn't get it right from

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
the first time

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
so they had the idea was that we could

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
work in

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,480
like newell had their own sprint cadence

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
and ffw

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,160
worked in their own spin cadence this

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
was first couple sprints while we

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,120
learned

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
and then we quickly realized that even

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,639
though our teams are big enough

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,040
to not be combined into one

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
by agile standards we we realized we

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,440
have one goal

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
and we had to come together to achieve

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,959
it and not

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,040
like try to compete on it right in

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,279
separate sprints and like trying to

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,600
drag tasks around well we'll take this

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,200
task because it's simple

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,200
so learning from this experience was key

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,200
i think oh i i think that's right we

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
we were very adaptable in terms of our

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
outlook we did we didn't

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,040
say this is you know this is exactly

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,639
what you're gonna do and stay with us

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
for the next 10 sprints we said no let's

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
let's each front let's really take in

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,240
lessons and figure out how we can

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,560
adjust and optimize including scaling

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,920
scaling up and down team so if we needed

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
you know changing the product uh

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
shooting the resource mix we said okay

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
we need to be more front heavy this

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
sprint or more back end heavy or if we

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
needed

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,160
let's add additional you know three more

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
developers because we know we have more

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,600
of these analytics tickets

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
you know being paid and it speaks to the

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,399
layer of

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
foundational communication that everyone

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
said and the transparency throughout the

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,959
project

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,639
and the engagement between the two teams

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
and you two teams becoming one that you

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,200
were able to make those adjustments

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
throughout

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
and that they weren't at separate

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
checkpoints and you know months or

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,639
sprints or

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,399
whatever that you were in real time with

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
each other responding to the needs of

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,399
the project

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,800
to help make it more successful i think

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,680
like speak to the level of planning as

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,839
well because

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
like unless we you know you plan a

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
feature set

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,480
out a certain you know number of sprints

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
in advance you're not going to be able

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
to scale your teams out because it's you

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,720
know adding a team

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,120
is not something that you can typically

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
do um you know in a few days

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
and so i think that that worked really

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,519
well for us

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
thanks lindsey next question was for you

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
actually um

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
since you were joining midstream with uh

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
you know the teams have a few sites

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
under their belts

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,480
what were your initial impressions

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
coming onto the project and you know

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
what did you see that was really really

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
helpful

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
would it be that maybe needed some

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,240
improvement

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,839
i mean so i think with joining any new

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,600
organization in a role or team

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,800
um you know it's it's always going to

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
have these challenges but you're only

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
going to be

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
successful is the information that you

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,440
have access to to you know on board

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,279
um you know kind of catch up and you

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
know get that context

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,120
and what i really appreciated about what

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,120
newell and ffw had done on this project

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,000
is just the amount of documentation

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
both technical and non-technical so um

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
they were really good at using

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,240
confluence is a wiki

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
um you know for requirements

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,160
documentation and things like ux

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,240
um documentation specs um so the

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,320
like you having on the technical side

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,240
having like useful commit messages

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
and um you know like being able to

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,839
follow code review history

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,440
uh was very very useful with being able

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,600
to understand

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
the architecture alexi was also very

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,839
good at um documenting

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
um like significant architecture

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
decisions

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
and um just so you could understand the

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
reasoning

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
you know behind some of those key

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,199
decisions and kind of get a history of

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
that

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,279
and just um and really a lot of it is

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,399
just jira commenting in general

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,120
the entire team um we always made a

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
point

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,720
um to comment every decision um or

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,199
update in

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,079
a juror comment and just being able to

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,000
look back on

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
old tickets and get that context was

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,240
just immensely

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
valuable um and i mean anyways like i

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,360
think

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,320
every project can benefit from improved

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,880
documentation

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
and so definitely in the process um you

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,839
know we

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
acknowledge that and then um you know

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,399
improved

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,839
the way that we were documenting things

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
um so i think that worked really well

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,040
and made the project very successful

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
thanks lindsay um so let's do a round

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
robin for this one uh what were the

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,279
largest

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
challenges that you each faced in your

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,519
roles on this brilliant and complex

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
project uh steve let's start with you

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
sure i i think you know any projects i

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
mentioned this data you know scope creep

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,680
is always going to be

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,079
a big concern especially we had a very

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
aggressive

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,440
timeline and uh that timeline could not

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,959
be moved at all

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
as as every part of it starts out you

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,680
know but uh

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
but the key thing was that uh i think

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,639
you know

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,079
one of the challenges is governance and

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,120
making sure that

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,120
uh you know that the team

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
both the product team as well as your

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
other stakeholders

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
all kind of understand what you're

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
building i think that you know we had

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
originally set out to build

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
a minimal bible product and we said okay

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
here's what you know

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,600
our our base feature set is and i think

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
that tends to grow

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
as as people start to get in there and

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,600
kick the tire and say oh this is great

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
look we can do with this and can we also

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
change this

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
so i think being able to really manage

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
that in a you know in a

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,040
fashion that says okay look we're going

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,639
to be iterative we'll get to those

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,959
features we'll do a fast follow

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,240
but right now let's let's focus on you

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
know hitting the timelines making sure

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,279
that we're delivering something that

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,800
that really serves and gives value

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,480
um so that was a you know biggest

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,880
challenge for me thanks steve

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
i've just seen i think one of the

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,000
biggest challenges that we kind of saw

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
as we continued in the project was kind

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
of our

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,640
deployments you know as we were adding

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
more sites to this

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,280
uh obviously deploying new code became

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,640
came with an impact of more sites so

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
you know obviously some of that we were

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,319
looking to cover using automated testing

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,760
which we did pretty successfully

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,360
but really it was just a challenge to

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,439
kind of make sure that we were all

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,120
clear on the impact of those that each

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,799
thing you roll out as you grow those

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,000
sites you know you're exponentially

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
increasing the amount

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
of verification you need to do before

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,320
your deploy but also your post deploy

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,480
verification to again make sure that

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
no harm was done to any website during

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,000
the deployment

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,240
right right alexis

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
well i think since we're building a

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,559
platform and essentially

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,919
uh every time you hear the word platform

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
you think you're gonna get all your

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,799
features on the board

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,960
uh we were kind of building free

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,320
platforms at the same time which was an

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,400
interesting challenge

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,840
uh we were serving three types of

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
clients which was

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
marketing sites catalog sites which

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
would have like

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,120
marketing material but also a catalog of

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,400
products

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,520
sourced from uh commerce cloud

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,080
and a catalog site could eventually

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,200
become a gtc direct to consumer side

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,200
and sell those products to your users

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
so having a checkout flow and stuff like

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
that we had to account for all three use

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,039
cases

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
in the same platform at the same time

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,000
and

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,880
continue supporting three clients you

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,760
could say

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
so the challenge was architecting this

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,679
in a way that that site

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,880
could start with as a marketing site

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
could later get

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
plugged in a catalog feed and become a

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
catalog site

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
to later become a dtc site at any point

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
in time new will

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,480
decides to change the business strategy

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,480
for this particular brand so if you

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,160
if you want to sell directly to consumer

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
you you would be able to do that

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,799
uh so having one platform with

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,520
all the nods knobs available as switches

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,840
to like enable disable all the

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,840
configurability we put in place for

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
brands to customize their theme their

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
layout uh

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,160
any components you would you would want

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,520
to use search being a universal feature

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,760
that would work for both with the

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,440
marketing side and and the catalog side

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,799
i think this was kind of the biggest

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
challenge and as

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,320
solute to what steve was mentioning

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
considering this is a platform a lot of

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
people are coming with their own

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
requests

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,080
and like can you add this and you're

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,640
like you're a snowflake

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,640
you'll have to wait we have a platform

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,960
understood lindsay yeah going off of

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
what the others said you know you're

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,960
building a platform

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,799
and not a site and um you know there's

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,840
certain things that you need to do

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,960
um to maintain and scale a platform

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,559
of sites successfully um that may not be

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
uh necessarily what you need to do to

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,840
launch a single site successfully and

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,600
like uh this includes um you know

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
building out the base platform itself it

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
could include

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
things like adding automation for

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,120
releases and like uh automated testing

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,840
like justine mentioned

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,559
like really leveraging ci cd um you know

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
really

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,360
uh you know building out your local

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,400
development tooling and just like you

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
know doing things like

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,080
upgrading core and your trip modules

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
like those things are

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
critically important to um you know

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
building out your platform and

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,120
maintaining it

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,520
but they may not add the the value of um

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,440
those tasks may not be immediately

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,440
obvious to your business stakeholders

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,559
and so um it can be a challenge at first

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,559
to really be an advocate

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
um to treat these things as like

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,159
critical features

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,840
and components of your platform i mean i

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
think well it may have been more of a

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
struggle at first

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,360
um you know we really did i think uh you

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,120
know get buy-in for a lot of these tasks

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,960
and um yeah thanks lindsay

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
uh that actually segues really well into

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,400
this next question so this is for steve

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,720
and justine um

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
when we're thinking about uh the other

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
teams

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,600
and uh the tracks of the project right

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,640
there's multiple tracks

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,640
uh tools and uh the other work uh what

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,400
were we leveraging to help support

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
the the drupal initiative

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
so as you asked other tools i mean one

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
of the things we did was

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
we used a lot of stuff that was already

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,640
existing i mean obviously

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
drupal 8 was robust enough to support

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,320
everything we wanted to do

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,919
with json api we used uh progressively

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,000
decoupled and lexi can talk more about

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,720
it in terms of react components as well

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,080
we leveraged uh tools like like vlt

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,600
which really helped with our

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,720
our builds we had travis ci we also used

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,159
aquarius site factory um just a lot of

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
kind of leveraging what was out there

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
that worked but we didn't necessarily

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,679
um you know if we needed to build

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,120
something we weren't afraid to build it

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
it's just that we're being kind of smart

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
about it and

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,080
if something works out of the box we

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,919
wanted to leverage that we also

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
in terms of process i think we had a lot

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
of good communication i think

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
one of the keys was really kind of over

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,799
communicating in addition to

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
you know slack and those kind of tools

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,559
we we did have a lot of

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,919
on-site meetings we also have uh you

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,159
know a lot of daily calls

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
initiative stand up so i i think those

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,360
are all things that we did to make sure

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
all the tracks were aligned

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,960
so steve um let's stick on that piece

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,799
because you know it's interesting to

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,840
think of the old engines when we were in

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,000
person together

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
when we're thinking about uh you know

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,159
those key moments

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,080
of how did you plan for the in person so

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,640
the majority of the project was remote

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,679
and you know

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,720
global um so what were we thinking about

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,919
with the in-person moments

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,679
so again because newell uh follows

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
safe hazel we would have product

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,559
increment uh sessions where you

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
basically figure out okay what are we

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
going to build during this next phase or

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,520
what what features does this site need

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,000
so we'd have big

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,440
uh you know kind of get togethers around

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,360
those where the different

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
uh tracks would meet and figure out okay

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,840
where where the cross dependencies

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,200
um are there any uh you know things that

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,039
we're gonna be waiting on

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,799
where it's going to prevent us from

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
starting right away so i think having

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,080
having clear definition of things you

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
know a definition of writing definition

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,760
of done

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,360
and having making sure that those other

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,840
teams whether it's the ux team that's

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,320
creating

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
you know wires and mock-ups or if it's

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
you know

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,240
some data that you're waiting on just

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,440
making sure all those things uh are

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,000
happening in concert

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
that was really thanks justine yeah i

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
think that

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,000
you know steve said we had kind of these

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,159
pi planning sessions

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
um when we brought um uh mainly the us

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,279
team members from ffw but also we

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,559
actually had some team members coming

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,000
over from ukraine

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,159
and they were usually probably around

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,760
three days and what was nice about that

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
was you know again we had lots of

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,360
different groups we were collaborating

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,679
in so what was a little unusual on this

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,200
project was our entire qa was completely

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
separate you know yeah and we had that

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,240
was something that your group and

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,960
another vendor were working on

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,279
um but we had you know product owners we

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
had

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,039
you know in this pi planning we put

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
everyone together so what was nice about

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
that was one

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,520
you get to see each other face to face

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,440
so we could actually you know build

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
relationships within all of those teams

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,799
which again is a

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,080
is a great way to to enhance your

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,559
collaboration

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,559
um but also use that as our kicking off

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,320
point for that next three months of work

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,039
so the goal of those was really to kind

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,120
of

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
plan them to get a sense of overall

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,039
velocity across the teams

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
but also for us to figure out where are

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,120
we interdependent and kind of what do

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
those you know as much as this is agile

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,360
there's absolutely dependencies

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
so that was a great thing to leverage in

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,440
person and then to be able to use that

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
as kind of our guiding star as we went

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,679
through

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,279
um and then really what we were looking

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
to do again was kind of

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
really stuck with the idea of agile

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,039
being very transparent

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
very communicative um so our goals again

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,240
were to try and

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,039
communicate if not over communicate on

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
some of these

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,240
and really continue to have an

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,159
assessment going on of you know

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
what might be an impediment where are

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,960
their dependencies

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
and then having those collaborative

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,279
conversations with those other teams

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,120
um i think flexibility was definitely

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,159
kind of needed because again we have

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,080
so many moving parts that building that

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,120
as an act of collaboration meant that

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,720
you know

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,240
we didn't get into situations where we

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
fought over things we

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,279
all had situations where we said okay

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
well this is an issue

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,120
how can we collectively mitigate that

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,120
and i think that that served us really

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,880
well and again we formed really nice

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,400
close relationships with

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,080
all of the different teams that again

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,279
are all working on the same goal

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,120
which is the success of the project

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,320
yeah and i i just want to add you

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,640
mentioned it justine but

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,880
part of it is that you know having a

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,960
partner like ffw it doesn't necessarily

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
i i think you can work sometimes in a

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,039
group where there's a strong cultural

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
bias to we have to do it this way or it

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,200
has to be done that way and i think that

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,880
it was good uh you know the f was great

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
at working not just with multi-vendors

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
but with with us as a as a company in

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
terms of

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,760
knowing okay let's figure out the best

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
solution not not necessarily just one

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,799
idea or the way we do it let's figure

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,679
out the way that works best for everyone

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,679
so that really helped

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,640
thanks steve um so as representatives of

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,960
the cms

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:19,120
track team um what did being strategic

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,440
mean to you on the project uh lindsey

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,039
um so again like when you're working

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,240
with you know multiple sites on a

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,000
platform um

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
you know some sites are gonna have

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,960
higher traffic they may have more vocal

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,840
stakeholders

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
um you're gonna get future requests and

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
i mean

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,240
it's you really have to find a balance

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
between um

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,760
you know when you say no like that's a

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,799
snowflake request that should not be in

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,440
the platform that's not something that

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,159
could be

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
you know beneficial um or like you know

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,480
effectively leveraged by other sites i

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,840
mean

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,760
you have to decide when you negotiate

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,400
that scope or like abstract

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,120
that feature maybe um to where it can be

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,520
you know

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
leveraged by you know multiple sites or

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,760
all sites on the platform or

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,200
um you know agreeing to add um that

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,440
feature to the platform so it can be

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,840
leveraged by all sites and so i think

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,679
i think you have to be really strategic

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,799
uh we were really strategic

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
um about setting those boundaries um and

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
it's

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
like you know critical as a successful

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
platform like this

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,840
thanks lindsay uh justine i see you

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,480
nodding away so please

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,039
please a part of that as well again was

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,200
kind of

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,039
being able to be proceed uh strategic in

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
a way where we could look again at where

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,640
are we going what are those high-level

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,480
goals you know what is the

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,399
the the purpose of the project we're

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
doing because you know again with many

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
many features we have many many

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,760
stakeholders it's really easy to just

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,440
get caught in the weeds of you know the

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,440
ticket by ticket basis

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,520
so really for from my perspective being

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
strategic was again kind of zooming out

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,760
from that

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
looking at the overall goals and

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
figuring out you know is there anything

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,159
that's getting in our way

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,000
is there anything that we're doing that

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,279
maybe we might want to try and do a

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,279
little bit differently because it

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,799
doesn't seem to be building on success

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,279
it seems to be possibly

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,960
you know detracting a little bit so so

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
from my perspective that was kind of the

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
big

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,320
um uh you know for my role that was that

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
that was what i needed to do in order to

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,440
kind of again

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
help us to to be very strategic and

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,960
ensure that we're not

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,799
missing the finish line because we're so

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
deep in the features

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,240
right uh steve

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,000
yeah so i i think both of what lindsey

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,679
and justine said you know resonate i

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
think the other thing is we really try

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,600
to

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,200
uh call out risk early so you know

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
if there's if there's something we think

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
hey this is going to impact velocity or

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,919
it's going to you know pack delivery

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,360
we really want to you know bring it have

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
it bubble up right away

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,640
because those are the kind of things

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
that i think it's important especially

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
in large organizations when you have a

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
lot of different pieces that are moving

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
uh to be able to say hey i just want to

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,159
make sure everyone's aware of this put

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,919
it on the radar

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,279
um that was that was one thing the other

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,600
piece was that i think

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,039
from a architecture standpoint alexa can

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
you know talk about this in lindsay as

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,000
well but

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,440
we we really also built things in a way

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,120
that didn't um

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,880
collect technical debt we kind of said

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,480
you know what we're building a platform

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,159
we're not building one-off sites

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,360
and you know if it takes a little bit

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,880
longer to do it let's do it the right

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
way and i think that really paid

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
dividends down the road

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,000
so that strategically we didn't have to

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
you know rip rip apart and do

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,039
open heart surgery whenever we need to

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,480
make a change or

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,159
eleventh hour someone said hey can you

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,600
also do this so i think that that was

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
something strategically that was

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,960
thank you alexa do you wanna expand on

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,679
that

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,440
sure uh so to explain a little bit on

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,559
that one example would be

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,799
we we started with a search being uh

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,880
just a search functionality in drupal

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,159
and then at some point we realized that

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,360
our search engine might change because

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,919
we have uh salesforce uh

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
coming with products and we have drupal

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,279
coming with content

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,000
so one of our strategies we employed

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
like can we build a ui for search that

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,440
works

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,640
for both at the same time and you just

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
plug in your back end

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
and we did that which was kind of cool

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,799
uh so yeah we

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,279
where we could we leveraged the front

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,720
end

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,360
uh in a way that we could plug in an

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,440
adapter

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
basically to different systems and we

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,720
kind of looked forward

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
what would that be if the experience

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,600
would be completely different

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
for drupal and the salesforce content if

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,919
that would be completely different

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,120
we immediately saw you do there was a

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,440
lot of ada

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,760
requirements on this project so you do a

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,679
lot of fixes for ada you have

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,919
kind of this everything polished and

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,159
then you bring another front end that

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,200
you have to fix again

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,799
we were trying not to do that so that

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,720
was kind of the strategy on

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,480
where we tried to go technically there

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,080
was another strategy we employed

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,600
for uh fighting over what goes on the

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,480
cms teams on board

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,880
and what doesn't belong on our board so

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,279
since

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,440
there's multiple teams in parallel

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,159
trying to achieve the same goal but

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,080
there's still a good amount of

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,039
dependencies between teams

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,600
cmst was at the end of the spectrum we

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,279
were

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,840
the last kind of station

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,919
on the train and the problem was that

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,399
all the dependencies piled up to us

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,159
so we would immediately be like you

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,440
didn't do this

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,480
whatever we could vote we kind of

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,880
started being very aggressive hey so you

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,600
guys

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,640
could build us a proxy please do that

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,360
you guys

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,480
want to do some very sophisticated

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,720
authentication

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,399
we don't want to deal with all your keys

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,600
we want like something like

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,799
simple json api give us one like

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,919
one key to use and like you you want to

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
do compliance

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,679
please do this on the proxy side so kind

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,799
of trying to manage

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,200
between different teams uh strategically

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,480
how we would get less work with one of

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,760
our strategies

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,720
all right well and again just to make

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
sure we were spreading those

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,080
dependencies because again

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
you know were we happy to do the work

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,960
yes but you know our issue was

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
usually being the last point before okay

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,519
is it done

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,960
at launch we needed to we needed to

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,799
ensure we were spreading that throughout

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,919
yeah and and i think and i think what to

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,440
what you said like being the last

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,159
station on the train i think

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,880
cms being the glass you know no matter

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,799
where the issue

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,519
uh originates you know it could be bad

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,360
data you know 20 systems away

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,720
ultimately it winds up first on our

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,399
doorstep someone says hey

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,399
this is what i'm seeing on the website

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,799
so that's typically what happens so

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,120
accessibility was briefly mentioned and

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,480
uh newell has a strong dedication to the

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,960
digital equity for

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
all uh which is really wonderful um

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
justine and steve can you talk a little

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,799
bit about that before we

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,120
keep moving

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,440
sure so absolutely newell is committed

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,000
to accessibility uh our our sites are

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,039
currently

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,679
uh double a uh compliant and we really

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,640
we have both

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,799
an in-house team that works on

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,799
accessibility and we also work with

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,200
other companies and tools to try to

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,159
really make sure that we remediate any

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,919
accessibility and user experience issues

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,039
so i think that's great and

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,960
just you can talk a little more about

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,640
the challenges of you know of doing that

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
and working with the development team

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,679
um i'll keep it up i mean it was not

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
without challenge

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,120
i mean we really appreciated it because

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,120
again having that commitment at the

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,880
get-go and baking this in is

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,480
i think as anyone who's ever done an ada

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,880
remediation project knows

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,320
you draw build it in the beginning um

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
the way that we actually managed a lot

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,559
of it was to establish kind of

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,240
a commonly agreed checklist of things

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,559
that had to happen for everything that

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,440
we're developing where ada was an issue

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,279
um and then also identifying areas where

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,960
um you know there may be options or

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,720
there may be specifics around that that

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,080
aren't covered by kind of the checklist

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
and that was kind of a nice way to

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,279
ensure that we were

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,960
implementing that you know in the same

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,799
way across all of that

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
but also then kind of calling out

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,480
specific features where we needed to dig

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,240
deeper and there was actually an ada

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
lead on the new group side which again

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,600
wasn't really useful

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,120
that really made things a lot a lot

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,559
easier and smoothed a lot of those

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,559
conversations

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,799
and to add to that i think just a fun

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,720
fact the most common cause of reopens of

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,760
tickets was accessibility and not

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,159
because

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
uh not because accessibility wasn't

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
built in but because

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,320
accessibility was a requirement and also

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,079
it's a very opinionated space so

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,599
there were some discussions after the

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,919
reopens obviously

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,520
but the fact that you cannot pass the

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,040
ticket the front-end ticket

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,760
further uh until accessibility installed

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,839
made this a requirement and not you know

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
a feature you had later

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,000
yeah i i agree also that you know

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,440
because a lot of the stuff is

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,359
our guidelines they're like there are

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,919
best practices but they change daily for

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,280
for accessibility that it does make it

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,560
somewhat debatable even if you have a

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,720
requirement set in stone

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,159
when you go to test it you know a lot of

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,040
it can't be automated in terms of the

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,240
testing so

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,440
someone may have a thought and you know

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,960
what it might be better if we do it this

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,599
way so i agree there were a lot of real

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,640
consistency

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,440
thank you so steven lindsay what

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
benefits

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,800
does newell brands derive from the

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,040
digital experience that was created

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,520
um so i mean by investing a lot of

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
effort

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,960
in building out the four platform and

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,880
things like automation and you know

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,440
having very rigorous processes

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,079
um you know we got to a point where we

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,160
could

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,200
um you know launch multiple sites over a

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,839
matter of weeks

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
with a very high degree of confidence in

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,520
um

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,160
that go live and um like it may have

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
taken

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,520
a bit of time you know to build out that

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,960
core platform and

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,720
you know that can be a difficult thing

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,160
um you know to kind of explain to your

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,599
business stakeholders why they

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,720
you know can't see a site um live

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,640
but um i think they um you know

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
the benefits speak for themselves when

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,200
you can when they can see

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,720
you know that build out of many sites um

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,720
you know in such a short amount of time

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,480
yeah i i agree completely with that the

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
speed speed to market factor i mean

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,920
at one point we delivered five

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,400
production sites in four weeks

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,040
and you know with a lot of rich content

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,280
um

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,720
and i think that's that's definitely

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
proved that you know the project was

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
successful i think the other thing is

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,359
that

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,240
um as alexi mentioned before uh you know

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,160
we have

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,280
different uh tiers different different

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,320
types of sites

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
catalog marketing and uh those sites

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,640
could be switched one thing wasn't

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,400
mentioned is that you didn't need to do

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,760
a new deployment in order to do that if

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,200
you wanted to switch a site to catalog

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,800
as long as you had data for it

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,640
you could do that so i think that that

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
kind of flexibility and the ability to

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
add

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,960
features very quickly not just to one

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,839
site but also like you know if we built

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,040
a new feature

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,560
every site could turn it on if they

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,280
wanted to so that's that's really i

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,240
think

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,359
that's amazing uh so with teams uh

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,320
lessons learned

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,800
from this project that you use on your

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,359
current

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,599
project work uh alexi i'm gonna start

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,880
with you

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,200
oh my

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
i think this has been one of the one of

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,480
the biggest

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,920
and interesting decoupled or

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,440
progressively decoupled

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,680
experiences uh i've worked on and

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,720
i i still refer to that day to kind of

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,240
things we did

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,920
on the mural project to

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,920
pick them and use them different

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
projects because we kind of

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,839
part of the best practices of

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
progressive dvd couple

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,240
and the the things we uh we used were

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,560
kind of very nice

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,720
uh for example like all of our

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,760
components that you could progressively

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,680
like embed had their own like blocks and

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,079
you could put them anywhere you want

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,359
like you can add like a paragraph or in

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,040
between or even

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,040
even somewhere in your header and stuff

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,359
like that but what they actually did

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,920
they

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,800
basically rendered like an empty div

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
which

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,839
uh lazily there was a react component

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,280
loaded into it using react portals if we

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,320
go a little technical

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,920
uh and that's the tactic

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,160
of uh doing everything lazily

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
meant that you're not loading your

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,079
entire like javascript library

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,320
when you need one small component on the

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,160
page uh your rather

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
if you have one component it's lazy

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,599
loaded and it's embedded and only what

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,880
this component requires

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,720
gets added to the page uh so that's

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,800
known as code splitting

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,880
like in general having a drupal and

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,040
having to manage a reactive base

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
was was an interesting challenge here

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,960
and i i think

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,119
to this day i'm i'm using this as a kind

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,119
of a baseline

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,320
awesome thank you lindsay

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,880
yeah i mean lessons learned so um

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,359
in doing demos and launching sites um

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,119
what we really emphasize is really

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,720
uh typically only the end user site

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,440
experience um however as

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,040
you know others have mentioned like we

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,119
invested a ton of effort

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,040
in developing a really elegant backend

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,720
interface you know with media management

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,720
and integration with their dam

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
with configurable site preferences and

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,599
um very elegant theme customization and

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,520
i think

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,880
um some of the value of those features

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,200
may not have been

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,119
uh as immediately obvious to business

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,359
stakeholders as it should have been so

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,240
and like you know moving forward uh you

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,079
know i

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,240
uh make more of a point to be i guess

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,079
like a more platform teacher

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,400
evangelist for that sort of stuff to

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,320
more you know effectively communicate

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,079
um that message and it's you know it's

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,040
important to successful project like

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,119
this

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,400
thanks lindsay justine i'm going to keep

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,599
it short because i know we want to have

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
some time for questions

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
i think for me it just kind of

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,280
reinforced and continues me to

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
um ensure that everything we do is a

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,280
collaboration

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,480
and the uni working together and being

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,480
adaptable and maybe

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
looking at different options will always

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,079
serve a project so

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,760
you know it's something i i felt that i

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,160
i knew already but i think that

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,760
this project particularly kind of really

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,560
showed what we can achieve when we

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,160
when we have that adaptability

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,320
absolutely steve

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,920
yep a couple things i mean everyone kind

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,480
of had the right idea but i would also

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,680
say

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,560
um you know evangelizing is kind of what

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,359
lindsay was looking to

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,319
was making sure that your end users of

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,680
your product

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,280
really understand the product i think

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,400
that's something where we were so

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,000
focused on

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,160
you know getting it done getting it done

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
in time doing with building with quality

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,240
that i think you know it kind of there

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
wasn't a team that was responsible for

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,160
saying

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,160
hey by the way you can do these 20

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,000
things did you know that so i think that

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,440
you know we built a cadillac but maybe

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,960
most users only knew how to

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,400
open the glove compartment so i think

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,680
that's that's something that maybe they

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,680
learn as they start to get in there kick

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,319
the tires but i think it's really

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,880
um it's really important to to make sure

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,119
that you are

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,880
training the people that are using the

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,680
system and that they understand all the

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,599
the capability and flexibility it offers

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,480
that's the easiest was important

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,640
the other the other one i was just

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,319
saying briefly is just that i think

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
it takes a lot of it takes a lot of

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,720
courage and dedication to build a

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,560
solution

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,760
i think there are a lot of you know

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,040
products and a lot of vendors out there

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,240
who say just just buy this off the shelf

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,920
just find it off the shelf

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,920
but i think that one of the things that

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
really was tremendous and it's a good

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
lesson

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,640
is that we gave ourselves a lot of

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,880
flexibility and future-proofed

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,400
you know the platform in terms of how

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,400
how we built this in my building

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,520
as opposed to just you know making

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,560
something cookie cutter and running with

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,079
the rest of the pack

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,599
it really helped you will differentiate

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,520
experiences thank you so much

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,280
a team you've been wonderful you've

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
shared so many wonderful insights uh

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,520
kayla before we

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,280
flip to you for some questions um we

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,079
would just like to say thank you to the

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,960
entire

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,319
newell ffw team for all of the hard work

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,079
and effort and thought that they put

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,680
into this marvelous platform

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,920
so thanks team uh kayla why don't you

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,240
set us up with some questions all right

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,000
so we might only have time for one

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,319
audience question so i'm gonna go with

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,880
gerardo who asked first

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,440
um he said how do you all document

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,839
architecture

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,760
right i can take this one uh so we used

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,560
the architecture view board

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,079
framework so the idea was that we were

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,079
not one team

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,640
not just the cms there was a lot of

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,760
dependencies it was the e-commerce team

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,480
and there was the api team and there was

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,800
there was a lot of the sap and like all

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,359
how the products flow into the system we

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
were again

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,240
last last station of the train uh but

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,000
the documentation of the architecture

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,200
and all the decisions had to be global

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
on the company level

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
so we were using a framework called

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,359
architecture view board i think that's

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,480
the name

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,119
and the idea was that we met weekly

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
with all the leads of different teams

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,200
and

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,079
we documented possible architectural

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
solutions

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,280
with options option one option two

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,359
option free

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,560
benefits downsides benefits downsides

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,400
benefits downsides

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
and we discussed them in the larger

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,400
group with business

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,000
involved and communicated clearly what

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,160
are those downsides that they can be

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,119
mitigated and what is the best point

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,760
forward

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,160
from there we went with a consensus

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,079
which

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,920
we picked one of the three options and

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,720
this went into implementation

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,599
and this was kind of a weekly cadence

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,680
and

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,800
i think it worked pretty successfully a

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,599
smaller team would not

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,720
need that but a big team like that was

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,599
absolutely critical

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,640
thanks alexi and so that was just to add

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,000
to that that so

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,000
all of that was documented and

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,720
confluenced um so that anyone

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,760
from newell on the ffw team would have

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,839
access to all that information

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,119
thanks kayla can we squeeze in one more

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,599
let's see carson black said um

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,599
have there been any snowflakes that had

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,520
to be completely rejected

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,000
or ejected from your site factory

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,839
platform or has json api

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,760
and custom theming been enough for your

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,680
needs then he said

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
sounds like progressive decoupling with

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,400
react was the solution to my previous

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,599
question

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,079
does that sound correct i can accept

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,720
that

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,680
uh so there were snowflakes so we had to

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,400
find them back

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,720
uh i think they're mostly where around a

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,440
brand wants to have it in a certain way

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,480
a brand wants to have a size selector on

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,000
the cart

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,400
and we are communicating back to the

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,280
brand guys not all brands have

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,160
a size you have to make it the flexible

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,400
attribute

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,400
like you could configure it in any sort

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,640
of way and they're like no we want

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,800
size to be here and you're like no we're

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,359
a platform so those kind of things

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,280
you can overcome all of those issues and

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:30,480
obviously we could build conflicts

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,480
we did not want to

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,640
steve anything to add there to close

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
this out

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,800
yeah i think you know i said one last

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,400
thing i would just say is that

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,720
we were very blessed in that we had

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,800
really uh a great team and still

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,640
still do as i said you know we had alexi

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,040
and lindsay and justine and yourself but

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,960
like

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,319
i i think that we were fortunate that we

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,760
had a lot of people who

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,920
had a lot of experience but also we were

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,160
able to kind of uh leverage

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,200
you know everyone's strengths and really

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,520
whether it's you know

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,640
have to deal with cars uh sorry caching

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,319
or architecture

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,319
or you know program management or

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,240
anything else i think we really uh

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,359
were very focused and uh i think that's

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,520
that's obviously

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,800
some some of it is is having the the

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,160
luck of having the right people at the

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,640
right time but also it's you know as i

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,839
said

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,000
everyone had a lot of great skills

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,440
experience thanks so much uh

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,079
thanks for coming to our session we

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,079
