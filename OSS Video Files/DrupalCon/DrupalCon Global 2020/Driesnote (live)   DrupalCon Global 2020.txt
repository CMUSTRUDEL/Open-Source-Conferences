Association and I'm thrilled to be here

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,150
with you this week although this

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,020
definitely wasn't our original Drupal

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,880
con plan for 2020 Drupal cons not only a

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,220
mission centric program for our

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,650
nonprofit Association but it's also our

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,170
largest source of funding last summer

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,420
staff and a myriad of volunteers began

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,610
the hard work of putting together Drupal

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,700
con Minneapolis which was scheduled to

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,950
happen in May of this year however in

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,810
March it became clear that there wasn't

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,759
a safe scenario for us to bring the

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,719
community together and have an in-person

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,790
event as we had planned as we evaluated

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,880
all of the options one thing was certain

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,819
we wanted to find a way to convene this

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,239
community and create the opportunity for

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,830
further collaboration and contribution

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,600
everyone has worked so hard to end

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,610
sure that we could bring the energy and

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,960
excitement of a typical DrupalCon

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,090
to life in this new virtual format and

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
sometimes with change comes opportunity

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,150
and DrupalCon global has been no

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,040
exception moving this event online have

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,080
the added benefit of allowing us to

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,120
dramatically widen our scholarship

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,790
program efforts with a particular lens

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,890
on diversity and inclusion so we've been

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,960
able to provide more access than ever

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,750
before for those underrepresented in

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,700
technology thank you to the

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,190
organizations and the local drupal

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,280
associations that partnered with us to

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,020
recruit new scholarship attendees I hope

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,650
you'll get a chance to chat with a few

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,330
of the over 150 scholarship recipients

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,640
here with us at Drupal con this week

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,980

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,060
some are even new to Drupal so welcome

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,950
thank you for being here I do want to

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,290
acknowledge the hard work of the program

committee the summit leads the speaker

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,490
team and the steering committee which

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,459
laid the groundwork for Drupal con

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,500
global we owe many many thanks to these

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,480
event volunteers from the community and

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,130
we've even recruited some from beyond

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,070
the Drupal community so welcome to you

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,690
as well

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,660
this event would literally not be

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,180
possible without our sponsors many of

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,090
these sponsors pledged their sponsorship

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,590
dollars back in March when the there was

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,870
no certainty about what would happen

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,910
with Drupal con they pledged to stick

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,010
with us as we figured out the new plan

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,140
and we so appreciate their ongoing

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,670
support be sure to visit them in the

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,440
exhibit hall this week thank you also to

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,420
the Drupal Association supporting

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,670
partners fundings from these

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,190
organizations help us do the work that

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,230
we need to do and creates funding that's

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,269
non event related which is really

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,660
important from a funding diversification

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,150
standpoint work we do like supporting

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,570
the development of Drupal 9 maintaining

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,450
drupal.org funding infrastructure and

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,799
contribution testing fees driving

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,430
diversity inclusion and equity

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,169
programming collaborating with various

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,789
drupal working groups like the security

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,159
working group which keeps the project

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,990
secure

00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:33,439
enabling contribution and even expanding

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,189
the types of contribution we recognize

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,680
none of this work would be possible

00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:41,639
without these organizations so thank you

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,639
so we can't talk about support without

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,409
talking about Drupal cares the Drupal

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,990
Association along with so many other

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:52,650
organizations was deeply impacted by the

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,629
Cova 19 crisis we had a lot of difficult

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,400
community conversations about what the

00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:59,879
project would look like without the

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,009
Drupal Association while we were still

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,409
crunching numbers on every possible

00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,990
financial scenario we got a clear signal

00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:09,479
from you the community that you stood by

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,340
ready to support us in help and the

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:18,750
Drupal cares emergency fundraising

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:20,190
campaign was born I appreciate how Matt

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,110
Westgate frames the work of the

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,639
Association and why our continued work

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,800
is needed early into the launch of the

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,139
Drupal cares campaign Drupal founder

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,819
Drees and his wife Vanessa made an

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,879
important pledge to support and

00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,800
encourage other donations and that

00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,810
became the matching gift challenge where

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,940
every dollar donated was matched by a

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:46,620
dollar up to $100,000 then a group of

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,659
dedicated business leaders from the

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,690
Drupal community came together to make

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,919
the campaign even better this group

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,409
announced the launch of yet another

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,779
matching gift challenge which made every

00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,029
individual cash donation and every new

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,240
or renewed membership have tripled the

00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:06,150
effect so now we're talking about

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,069
$300,000 in support community members

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,529
got creative we even saw wonderful

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:14,969
projects like pixels for Drupal the

00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:18,210
Drupal 9 module challenge and more the

00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:20,339
point is every action mattered every

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,740
donation whether large or small every

00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,810
tweet of support that you sent every new

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,180
or renewed membership you made a

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,339
difference you ensured that we met the

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,349
drupal cares emergency fundraising goal

00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,419
of half a million dollars and not only

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,060
that we met it but we did it in record

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,370
time you demonstrated once again the

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,610
power of this Drupal community and the

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,259
power of the open source model itself

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:48,259
as as Driss said this was really

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,659
important so that we could refocus

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,430
Drupal thanks Drupal hugs and all of the

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,219
Drupal happy things to everyone who

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,050
participated in Drupal cares and as you

00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,180
can also see from Jesus quote about the

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,919
Drupal cares campaign this was all

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,810
happening at the same time we were

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,939
launching Drupal 9 and Drupal 9 is here

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,250
this is where there'd be thunderous

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,659
audience applause and participation so

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm just going to envision that's

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,650
happening for all of you at home because

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,330
it's very exciting

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,009
not only did Drupal 9 launch but it

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,349
launched during the earliest of the

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,360
three projected release windows on June

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,830
3rd of this year which marks an

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,219
incredible accomplishment by this

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,750
community and everyone involved there

00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:33,060
are many opportunities to learn about

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,210
Drupal 9 during Drupal con global this

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,729
week if you want to fall in love with

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,580
this community just take a look at

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,529
celebrate drupal.org members from around

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,219
the world contributed photos drawings

00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:49,680
videos and more all celebrating the hard

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:52,590
work and collaboration it took to launch

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,169
Drupal 9 and in fact this site is now

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,659
also showcasing Drupal con global

00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,400
celebrations and videos so post your

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:03,740
submissions this week and be part of the

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,740
ongoing fun as we celebrate Drupal

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,830
simply put contribution makes Drupal

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,360
what it is it's obvious that code

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,860
contribution is essential in fact we

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,469
couldn't have launched Drupal 9 without

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,770
it and the work for Drupal not Drupal 10

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,089
which it launches in two years actually

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,479
needs to happen now as well

00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:29,250
contributions is important as ever but

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,620
we need to create a broader range of

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,810
what's recognized to recognize and

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,779
encourage contributions of all types to

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,120
the Drupal project so we launched the

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,490
contribution recognition committee last

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,829
fall announcing it at Drupal con

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,839
Amsterdam and it was part of the Drupal

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:48,529
Association's commitment to creating a

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,100
frictionless and truly rewarding

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,660
contribution system for this community

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,600
so the committee

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,879
has paused to do the kovat 19 crisis the

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,769
DEA team stands ready and will keep

00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,170
working to recognize more kinds of

00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:07,360
contributions and to make the process of

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,889
crediting contributions even easier

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,110
speaking of contributions don't forget

00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:14,600
to join in this week not only if we

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,699
brought the conference online but thanks

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,240
to volunteers you can contribute online

00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,240
as well

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,439
before I leave today I want to talk

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,420
about one of the most important focus

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:30,079
areas for the Drupal Association and

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,329
that's diversity equity and inclusion we

00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,029
know that diverse representation is low

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:37,100
in technology and with data shared by

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,470
Drees at the DRI's note in seattle last

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,649
year we also know the numbers and open

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,420
source are even more troubling

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,730
luckily the values and principles for

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,230
our community are a natural conduit to

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,839
this kind of diversity equity and

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,339
inclusion work and frankly it's why

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,750
Drupal has been a leader in this space

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,910
for years last month the Drupal

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,980
Association we released our official

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,079
statement in response to the ongoing

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,389
violence of racism and communities

00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:07,279
around the world and particularly here

00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,500
in the United States we made a

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,839
commitment to follow these words with

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,120
actions though we began this year with

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,069
diversity equity and inclusion plans and

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,380
goals for the Association we've

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:24,350
accelerated those activities in recent

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,600
months it's important to me that our

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,939
team is doing the work so that the

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,189
increased cultural competency and

00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:33,620
inclusive decision-making within our

00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:36,500
team can be applied to the work we do

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,899
for the Drupal community and short my

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,279
hope is we create a positive ripple

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,959
effect so I'm excited about some of the

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,569
things coming out for the community as

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,879
well we're collaborating with a cohort

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:51,680
of Drupal training organizations to

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,079
create a program focused on developing

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,430
Drupal talent with an emphasis on

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,220
supporting those typically

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,709
underrepresented in technology and open

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,779
source this pilot program is scheduled

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,880
to launch this fall and I'm excited

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,520
about how we can not only move the

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,710
needle on diversity but also provide the

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,120
developer talent that is much needed in

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:16,760
our community with a more diverse

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,070
equitable and inclusive community the

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,110
Drupal project will thrive and will

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,000
drive even more innovation so that

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,770
people can make a positive impact

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,380
through Drupal you can also help us make

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,480
a difference this week Acquia and last

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,420
call media will both donate five dollars

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,160
to black girls code for anyone that

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,430
registers interest at their booth in the

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,980
exhibit hall in addition message agency

by your presence at this event we just

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,580

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,930

other and we'll make connections that

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,710

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,960
community and now I have the pleasure of

that Fatemeh can officially introduce

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,740
the DRI's no thanks Heather

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,810
welcome everyone to your first virtual

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,270
trip booked on this is all really new

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:59,060
for us isn't it it makes me think back

00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,280
to my first triple con which was four

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,380
years ago in your leans where I was

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,780
totally new to Drupal I didn't know what

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,880
it was whoo core contributors were what

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,550
if you was or how many of these things

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,190
work together there were so many things

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,160
to learn people to meet bots to be

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,980
confused and slime to collect I also

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,680
remember being a volunteer and during

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,509
the closing

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,029
we were supposed to hand out stickers

00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,910
for next year's conference to attendees

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,339
as they left the hall and I was so

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,069
excited that I went and handed a stack

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,319
of stickers to juries we had a really

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:37,259
good laugh about that and I even have a

00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:39,869
picture to remember it by but that first

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:43,079
duple con was just really overwhelming

00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:45,629
for me and sometimes confusing as I can

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,540
imagine this one might be for so many of

00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:49,319
us I know that we have fond memories of

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,959
DrupalCon

00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:54,839
I know that I will really miss hallway

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,990
conversations game nights and even

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,879
heckling eating onstage at trivia but

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,920
that being said I am really looking

00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,779
forward to exploring all of the

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,610
different ways that we will engage and

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,369
connect with each other virtually this

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,350
week and I'm so excited to welcome all

00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:13,559
of the people for whom this is their

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,170
first DrupalCon being virtual we've been

00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,869
able to open up opportunities to bring

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,399
in new speakers and new attendees who

00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,980
may not have been able to attend

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,079
otherwise we're so happy to have you

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,029

make friends and feel inspired to take

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,499
back what you've learned I also think

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,899
that this is a great time for us to

00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,819
reflect on the community that we want to

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,059
be and the traditions that we want to

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:43,889

screen now for those that don't know me

I'm Greece I started the project and I'm

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,030
still depressed aday you can find me

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:05,990
online as you can see here we have a lot

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:09,710
to cover today the main topics for today

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,480
are the release of Drupal 9 and then I'm

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:15,920
gonna talk a lot about Drupal 10 and

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,040
what we're going to focus on next but

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,400
before we get started I wanted to

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,920
recognize that there's a lot going on in

00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,930
the world right now and to start I

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,740
wanted to extend my sympathies for

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,630
everyone impacted by Kovach 19 this has

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,330
been hard this has been hard for many

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:39,380
including the Drupal Association as

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:42,590
Heather talked about for those in the

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,650
black community we know that you carry

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,410
an extra burden and I want to be clear

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:51,050
that I and the Drupal community stand in

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,020
solidarity with you the need for

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,150
increased diversity and inclusion was a

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,940
major theme at last year's Drupal con

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,520
and you may remember this light where I

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,250
talk about why diversity and include

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,709
inclusion is so important not only is it

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,040
the ethical right thing to do but it

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:15,140
also improves innovation and creativity

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,810
and collaboration as a project we are

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,480
committed to making Drupal a more

00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,329
diverse and inclusive place for black

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,689
people and other people of color so that

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,850
we can all drive at this year's Drupal

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,070
con we actually have our most diverse

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,590
lineup of speakers ever which is

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,330
something that I'm very proud of and we

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,890
will continue to make this a priority

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:41,960
going forward I feel responsible you

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,770
know as as Drees as an individual but

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,190
also as a

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,310
project lead of Drupal to talk about

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:51,470
diversity equity and inclusion but also

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,140
feel like we need to make meaningful

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,580
changes and and concrete actions it's

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,650
not enough to just talk about these

00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,710
things so there's a few things that

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,920
we're doing in addition to what Heather

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,590
just talked about one of the things that

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,990
we're doing is we're reviving the values

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,970
and principles committee and we're going

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,510
to review our values and principles

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,980
through a lens of anti racism our

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,300
community working group and community

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:23,450
health the team is already in process of

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:26,360
reviewing our code of conduct to make

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,720
sure you know to update our anti

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,850
harassment language and things like that

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,670
to make it very clear that we do not

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,820
tolerate discrimination harassment and

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:41,270
racism in our community we will continue

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,000
to track and publish diversity data so

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,920
we can hold ourselves accountable I will

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,440
personally make a donation to black

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,100
girls code and in addition Acquia my

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,790
company is donating $5 to black girls

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,890
code for everyone that joins our booth

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:01,190
and clicks their register interest

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,590
button and I know this is just the start

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:07,790
I know this is not enough but we will

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:14,780
continue to make progress and work on

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:16,640
this until we see true racial justice so

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,310
I wanted to thank you

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,710
and thank everyone that's you know

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,890
working with us that's helping us work

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,110
through these crises both Kovan 19 as

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,810
well as the financial challenges of the

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:33,860
Drupal Association as well as topics

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:36,080
like racial injustice obviously I would

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,940
have preferred to meet in person but I'm

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,860
still very happy that we were able to

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,130
you know pull off this virtual

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,250
conference and able to meet sort of

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,670
virtually and while that does feel

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,730
different you know still feels really

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,550
good that we are together now here

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,180
virtually and it feels really good

00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,870
actually

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,600
knowing you know all of the things that

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:05,090
we do I truly believe that Drupal is in

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,330
a very unique position where we can have

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,460
a real impact if you think about some of

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,430
the side effects of of what is happening

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,490
is that you know in times of financial

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,920
crisis many organizations have to do

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,250
more with less and when you have to do

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,560
more with less budgets are cut and

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,750
frankly open source and Drupal become

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:32,890
more relevant we've seen this in all of

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:35,900
the previous financial crises but also

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,700
because retails and stores are closed

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,770
many organizations are actually going

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,690
through an accelerated digital

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,790
transformation where they have to move

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,670
more of their business online and again

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:51,620
this is something that makes Drupal even

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:54,950
more relevant today and so you know on a

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,170
positive note I would say we have some

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,140
other exciting news obviously and that

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,450
is that last month we released Drupal 9

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,930
and we release it on time as we said we

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,880
would and maybe a little unconventional

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,670
this time around but we still found an

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,180
appropriate way to celebrate the release

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,520
of Drupal 9 with people all around the

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,780
world and have a very quick video of

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,780
that that I would like to show you

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:37,450
[Music]

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:47,520
[Music]

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:53,349
[Applause]

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,349
[Music]

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:07,580
[Music]

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,080
isn't it awesome I just love how much

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,420
progress we've made in the last four and

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,270
a half years and how we were able to to

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,580
celebrate this there's so much great

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,130
things that we did just to give you a

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,650
few quick examples obviously throughout

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,950
the Drupal 9 release cycle we added

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,530
media management which is great because

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,200
it gave us a completely new way of

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,450
managing images and videos and it's a

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,690
lot more user friendly and it was ever

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,700
been before we also worked on a new way

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,340
to create layouts and to manage layouts

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,200
with the layout builder and really

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,980
dramatically improved page building in

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,440
Drupal which is awesome we made amazing

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,690
progress through our API first

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,900
initiative which is all about it

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,970
advancing drupal's web services support

00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,550
to help build headless or decoupled

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,500
applications and you can see you know

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,350
some pretty famous organisations in the

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,080
world have begun using this to build no

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,300
native apps and to you know push content

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,060
in all sorts of devices and modalities

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,730
and maybe best of all and this one I'm

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,130
particularly proud of is that we

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,500
delivered on our promise to make Drupal

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:26,810
9 the easiest update or upgrades and in

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,430
the recent history of Drupal just

00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,500
looking at some of the stats you know a

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,320
third of all of the modules are actually

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,660
already Drupal 9 which is record

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,180
breaking and then another third of all

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,460
of the modules there's only one line of

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,370
change required to make them fully

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,650
Drupal 9 ready so hopefully we can make

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,560
some progress on those this week and so

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:51,470
all in all Drupal 9 has the easiest

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,470
upgrade path in the last 15 years of

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,570
Drupal and maybe longer which is awesome

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,170
and our users love it like if you go and

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,660
Twitter

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,000
you see people tweet about it every day

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,000
and here's just a handful of the

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,820
streets where people say how smooth are

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,980
not easy the a great pad is I personally

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,860
upgraded my own site I know that's a

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,440
simple site but it took no more than 20

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,170
minutes to upgrade my personal blog from

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,260
Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 so that was a very

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:24,290
special feeling to be able to do that so

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,570
all in all it's difficult to highlight

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,940
everything but there's just so much that

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,100
we've accomplished and so I think it's

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,590
fair to say that we really climbed a

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
mountain together and made progress on

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,630
each of these four strategic tracks

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,960
which I think has been fantastic if you

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,370
look at that through the lens of data

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,120
you have data points like this where we

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,640
had 55 buck fix releases of nine major

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,410
releases thirty-five alphas betas and

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,230
release candidates in twenty four

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,450
security releases that's a lot of work

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,410
for the core committers and the release

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:02,390
management team so big kudos to them for

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:05,050
you know doing this like no like

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,670
clockwork as a heartbeat for the project

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:10,520
we also have a new innovation model

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:13,580
where new features can enter a Drupal

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,340
core as experimental and can then sort

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,790
of graduate to become stable features

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,590
and we have 13 major features go through

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,350
this process which i think is a great

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:27,110
testament to this new innovation model

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:31,580
and how well that's been working in

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:36,910
total over 4,500 individuals contributed

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:40,250
to Drupal 9 and you know over 760

00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:43,160
organizations contributed to Drupal 9

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,020
which is really hard to believe and it's

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,180
even more impressive if you look at the

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,610
names on a slide there's just so many

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,990
names of people that helped make this

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,320
happen

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,420
it's really kind of amazing to think

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,810
about that and then of course a lot of

00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:02,300
these people have been supported by

00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:05,480
organizations so thank you all for

00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,310
contributing to Drupal 9 it's a

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,190
fantastic release I think it's maybe the

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:12,230
most progress we've made in a long time

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,900
and I really think it will change the

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,160
perspective that the world has on Drupal

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,830
because

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,320
you know we may drupal a lot easier to

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,270
use and a lot easier to maintain which

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,730
is some of the feedback or criticism

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,770
that people have so I think it's a

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,170
fantastic accomplishment and I really

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,630
thank you for contributing and making

00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,690
that happen just as a quick reminder if

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:38,510
you are on Drupal 8 still you have about

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,970
I think 16 months or so two upgrades and

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,740
some quick math I hope that's right and

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,360
if you're on Drupal 7 you actually have

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,730
more time which may sound a little

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,580
counterintuitive but you have more than

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,780
two years before Drupal 7 its end of

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,270
life that's something that we've

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:56,180
recently changed we extended it by a

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,640
year and after that actually you have a

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,920
commercially extended support as well so

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,170
if you're on seven we encourage you to

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,770
upgrade but if you're not ready to

00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,390
upgrade you know you can stay on Drupal

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,120
seven it is well maintained and

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,210
supported with bug fix and security

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,120
releases um so that's a little bit about

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,830
Drupal 9 and so now I really want to

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,560
spend most of the rest of the

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,640
presentation talking about it what we're

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,680
going to do next

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,230
what are some of the new things that

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,680
we're gonna do as we think about Drupal

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:34,550
10 now before I dive in I wanted to

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,470
share a few quick things one is that we

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,600
learned from Drupal AIDS that we

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,450
actually had too many initiatives if you

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,310
remember that Mountain slides there is

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,900
more than 15 initiatives on that

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,370
mountain and in fact not all of the

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,490
initiatives were on that mountain so

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,490
that was a lot and we didn't finish them

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,380
all despite a lot of great progress the

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,570
other thing that we know already is that

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,930
we won't have the same amount of time to

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,640
build Drupal 10 then we had for a

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,980
building Drupal 9 and I'll come back to

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,630
that in a minute here to explain a

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,900
little bit more but with these two

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:12,790
things in mind my goal for today is to

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,290
propose five initiatives for Drupal 10

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:18,110
and I know that sounds like a lot less

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:20,570
and it is but it allows us to focus and

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,970
allows us to make great progress now

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,680
when I think about five initiatives I

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,950
want to make sure that these initiatives

00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,180
are well balanced right and what I mean

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,540
by that is that

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,260
need to balance both technical debt and

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:38,570
innovation we need to consider different

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,450
stakeholders or personas for example we

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,340
need to think about what developers want

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,260
but we also need to think about what

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,450
site builders and content creators want

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:51,050
and even sellers people involved with

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:56,810
convincing potential customers or users

00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:58,760
of using Drupal going forward we also

00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,820
need to balance a long term and short

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,040
term goals which can be hard and the

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,340
last but not least we need to work

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,280
towards a strategic vision that makes it

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,620
really really clear to individuals and

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,750
organizations as to why they should

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,940
adopt Drupal like it should be obvious

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,240
if you're doing this kind of work you

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,460
should use Drupal to be really

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,130
differentiated compared to other

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,320
solutions now the way I want to go about

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,490
this today is in two steps

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:34,130
when step one is to make a list of all

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,100
of the important initiatives to consider

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,770
so I'm going to make a list maybe twenty

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,070
to twenty-five potential initiatives and

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:46,460
then we're gonna have the heart you know

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,410
chore I guess of selecting just five and

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,590
that will be hard but we're gonna try

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,810
and make sure that they're well balanced

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,430
my right so that's the plan and so let's

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,640
start with making the list of

00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,440
initiatives to consider and so the way I

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,370
think about this there's sort of four

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,260
buckets of initiatives to consider one

00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,600
are the initiatives or the things that

00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,230
are mandatory because they're security

00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,830
related to are things that we've already

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,510
started that are still pretty awesome

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,790
that people still want but that we

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:24,020
haven't finished and so things that we

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:27,080
want to finish three are things that

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,390
existing users are asking us for things

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,030
that they want to see in future versions

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,400
of Drupal and last the fort bucket it's

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:37,460
things that we know we need to do to

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,910
attract new users to Drupal and to stay

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,759
relevant in the long term so things that

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,289
users are asking us for

00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,720
are tend to be a little bit more

00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,789
short-term whereas things that will

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,429
attract new users and that make people

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:54,200
feel confident about picking Drupal for

00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:56,059
you know to build their sites for the

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,399
next you know decades

00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:00,200
tend to be a little bit more longer-term

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,899
so let's go through these four buckets

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,850
and let's start with the things that we

00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:07,850
need to do because we feel they're

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,039
mandatory to do and a lot of that comes

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,669
down to keeping Drupal secure as you

00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:15,980
know Drupal depends on a lot of

00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:18,590
third-party components and each of these

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,960
components have an end of life if you

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,210
put that in a timeline like this you can

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,549
see some of the components or the

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,039
dependencies that Drupal has and for

00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,990
some we already know when their end of

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,090
life and then for others we know there

00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,549
is a new version either there is a

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,619
version already or we know a version is

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,659
you know the new version is eminence but

00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:40,820
they haven't really communicated their

00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,619
end of life but the point is each of

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,899
these components that we need to track

00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:48,889
them and manage their end of life and in

00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:51,580
this case symphony for and ckeditor for

00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:55,309
we know their end of life at the end of

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,720
2023 and really what that does it forces

00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:59,450
us to end of life

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,210
Drupal mine as well right and so what we

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,749
need to do is we need to release a new

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,240
version of Drupal well before these are

00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:10,399
end of life because we want to give our

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,009
users you know all of the users of

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,440
Drupal 9 time to upgrade their site

00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,230
before these components are end-of-life

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,509
and so really what that means is that

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:26,090
we're targeting the release of Drupal 10

00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:29,690
to be around June of 2022 now some of

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:33,169
you may you know panic a little bit or

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,879
be afraid because that is actually you

00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:37,279
know like two years away or even a

00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:39,590
little bit less than two years away and

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,110
you know obviously there will be an

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,610
upgrade from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10 but

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:49,369
let's not forget we made upgrades easy

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:51,860
and we will continue to make upgrades

00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:54,350
easy just like we did from Drupal 8 to

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,060
Drupal 9 and in fact there's a lot of

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,740
things that we have learned from that

00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,550
that will allow us to make it even

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:05,060
smoother so don't panic the upgrade from

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:08,000
Drupal 9 to Drupal 10 should be easy now

00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,580
what that means for those of you that

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,430
are contributing to Drupal 10 or thrive

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:17,360
the Drupal 9 development cycle is that

00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:19,670
actually Drupal 9.3 alpha they serve the

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,910
last opportunity to introduce new

00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:25,580
features or replace existing features or

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:28,880
API because we do need some time to

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:32,000
prepare for Drupal 10 and to remove

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,530
deprecated code for example so really

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,440
what that means is that we don't have a

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,300
whole lot of time for innovation for

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,160
implementing new features and

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,370
capabilities in fact if you compare that

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,910
the Drupal 9 we have less than two years

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:49,610
compared to 4.5 years and we only have

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,800
three minor releases that we can use to

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,980
innovate you know compared to eight

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,450
minor releases in Drupal nine so that's

00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,320
just something to keep in mind and

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:03,170
another reason why five initiatives for

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,190
drupal two and scenes you know

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:09,260
sufficient anyway with all of that said

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,210
the first initiative that i think we

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,670
should consider and we may not have a

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:16,430
choice here is what i've called the

00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,830
drupal 10 readiness initiative which is

00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,960
really all about making sure that the

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,660
dependencies or the components that we

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,790
use are properly managed and that we

00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,860
have you know proper security coverage

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,840
for all of them now if you go into a

00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,610
little bit more detail you can see

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,710
there's a long list of these initiatives

00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,110
here and for each of them we need to

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,270
figure out what to do often it's just an

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:41,120
upgrade but in some cases we need to

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,340
think about it do we stick with that you

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,290
know components or do we actually want

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,830
to change it to something else like for

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:51,550
example CK editor for CK editor 5 is a

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,110
major rewrite with lots of API changes

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,180
so you know we need to decide do you

00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,340
want to go with CK editor 5 or is this a

00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,600
good time to maybe reconsider our

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,980
options now some of these initiatives

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,560
and these upgrades I should say of

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,870
components are actually very good right

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,920
like some of them actually give us new

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,200
capabilities new

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,200
API snoo innovation so it's not just

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,990
maintenance work we actually in some of

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,990
the cases get real benefits and user

00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,119
benefits due from these initiatives and

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,619
you know ckeditor would be a great

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,170
example because they've made a lot of

00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:28,970
improvements and they allow like

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,309
collaborative editing and these kinds of

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:34,700
things with future versions of seek

00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:37,099
editor as you can see the total effort

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,960
for all of this is large I mean some of

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:42,650
them are extra large on their own but

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,109
then if you add up everything it is kind

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,240
of a large undertaking to get ready for

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,849
Drupal 10 and this is not even

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,559
everything that we have to do so that's

00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,839
really the first initiative that I

00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,180
believe we should consider and so I'm

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,799
adding it here in the bucket of things

00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,109
that are mandatory

00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:02,420
so with that let's move on to the next

00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:05,650
bucket which is things that we've

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:08,119
already started but not finished and

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,460
there's actually a lot of amazing things

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,579
that we've started but not entirely

00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,829
finished and so one example is the media

00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:18,349
initiative which gives us this new media

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:21,319
library to help manage images and videos

00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:23,420
now it actually ships with Drupal 9 its

00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:25,460
stable when it ships with Drupal 9 and

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,089
we encourage people to use it

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:31,700
however it's not enabled by default so

00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:34,460
if you install Drupal it's not part of

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,799
the out-of-the-box experience now we

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,380
don't love that because it's such a

00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:41,780
great feature for you know beginners and

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,510
you know people that are less technical

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,890
they really benefit from this and so

00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,109
what we want to do is we want to finish

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,599
this right we want to add some of the

00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:53,480
things that are missing like integration

00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,369
with some parts of Drupal some usability

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,430
and accessibility improvements and

00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:01,579
things like that in the same boat is the

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,619
layout builder again it is stable it

00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,680
ships with Drupal 9 we encourage people

00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:10,490
to use it but it's also not enabled by

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,410
default and that's a shame because it's

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,750
a much better experience a lot of

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:17,150
usability improvements come from using

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,670
the layout builder so we need to finish

00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,369
it in order to do so we need to think

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,480
about replacing the you know existing or

00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,580
the old block

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,470
you i we also have to make some

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:31,580
usability and accessibility improvements

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:34,160
and some other things as well our new

00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,280
admin fee the name of that theme is

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,890
claro is more or less in the same boat

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,230
its ships with core but it's still beta

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,030
so it's not stable and it's also not

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,910
enabled by default and it's such an

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,430
improvement in terms of the

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,770
administrative experience also in terms

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,710
of accessibility that we want to enable

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,750
it by default and ship it to be the you

00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,880
know default experience for everyone and

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,490
so again there's a few things that we

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,870
need to finish like media integration

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,850
toolbar support and we want to make sure

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,700
that the module administration page as

00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,160
an example looks really good so I think

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,410
it's pretty close but it still needs to

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,830
be finished and so what I did is I

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:18,590
actually bundled each of these or all

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:20,510
three of these things into one

00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,700
initiative and the goal is to push them

00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,990
over the finish line make it an

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,580
out-of-the-box experience for Drupal and

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:32,840
that will be very important because it

00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:34,970
will make Drupal a lot easier out of the

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,280
box and that is very important because

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:40,190
you may remember from my Drupal con

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,240
Amsterdam presentation that we did some

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:46,550
user research we interviewed CMS users

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,980
not just Drupal users but different

00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:52,670
users of different CMS's and we asked

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:55,190
them what they're sort of perceptions

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,890
are of the CMS over time and what we've

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,160
learned is that beginners don't love

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:03,470
Drupal to put it you know plainly but

00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,930
then as they advanced as they become

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,540
more experienced they start to love

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:13,610
Drupal more and more which is why this

00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:16,460
line goes up and to the right though is

00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:20,060
interesting is that other CMS's at the

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,250
exact opposite trend line you know when

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,220
we spoke to WordPress or Adobe or site

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,830
code site core users we learned that the

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,980
beginners loved those platforms but then

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:33,920
over time as the user became more of an

00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,410
expert they start to love these

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,319
platforms less and less which is kind of

00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,079
remarkable that

00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:42,449
Drupal trends serve the exact opposite

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,519
direction but it speaks to the

00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:46,979
opportunity it speaks to the opportunity

00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:48,809
of improving the beginner experience

00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:51,690
because if we can attract more people to

00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,519
Drupal give them a great experience we

00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,619
should feel confident that they will

00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,619
stay with the platform for a long time

00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,719
and so that's why I believe the easy

00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:02,789
out-of-the-box experience is an

00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,680
important initiative to consider

00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:09,209
I believe that ease of use of Drupal is

00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,819
probably the number one thing that we

00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:15,630
should focus on other than obviously

00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:20,160
security but there is more another

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:22,589
example is Oliveira and Oliveira is our

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,839
new front-end theme that we've been

00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:27,299
building for some time now Oliveira is

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,609
not even in core yet it doesn't ship

00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:33,719
with Drupal yet so the goal here would

00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:36,599
be to get Oliveira included in a future

00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:39,989
version of Drupal 9 make it stable and

00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,779
also enable it by default so down

00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:45,690
again we leave people with a first great

00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:48,420
impression and a great theme to look at

00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,729
and learn from and so a new front-end

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,180
theme is another initiative that we

00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:57,059
should consider another one is automated

00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,989
updates today when we do a security

00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:03,959
release you know organizations that use

00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:07,170
Drupal often have to keep an expert on

00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:10,499
call to help with that security upgrades

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:13,519
and these security releases then to

00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:17,489
happen around noon

00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,319
you know Eastern Time and of course for

00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:21,599
some people depending on where you live

00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:24,299
in the round in the world that is sort

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,079
of an inconvenient time zone and so

00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:32,009
making security updates automated would

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,779
be you know a great win now some of you

00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:36,269
may recall that this was actually an

00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:37,619
existing initiative which means that we

00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:39,479
have a pretty good plan for this

00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,239
initiative and that we've actually

00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:45,660
already made a lot of significant

00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:48,269
progress and some of that thanks to the

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,219
European Commission will really want

00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:51,330
this feature for themselves and have

00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,170
been funding

00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:56,850
a lot of the work on automated updates

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,610
so let me give you a little bit more of

00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,980
a detailed look at where we're at so

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,470
that you can you know maybe help

00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,640
contribute to the initiative so if you

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:11,640
think about automated updates you know

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,980
if I simplify what needs to happen when

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,050
an automated update or cures it's

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,790
basically four things first we need to

00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,760
prepare for the upgrade which means

00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:23,190
Drupal needs to check that it's in a

00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,250
let's say healthy or clean state that

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:29,400
nobody modified or hacked Drupal core as

00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,500
we say once we know that Drupal is in a

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,290
clean state we obviously have to figure

00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,850
out what needs to be updated the things

00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,950
that need to be updated may have

00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,630
dependencies that need to be updated so

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,940
there's a whole process on figuring out

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,590
what are the updates that I need to

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,990
download or what Drupal needs to

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:48,300
download once we've downloaded all of

00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,310
the different updates or packages we

00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,680
want to check that they're also not

00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,390
compromised right we want to verify that

00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,660
these are things that we know and are

00:42:54,390 --> 00:43:00,330
safe to update and once we've downloaded

00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,700
everything once we have verified

00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:05,700
everything we need to switch to the new

00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,720
code do these new updates and that's

00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,060
actually a little bit complicated

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,000
because we want to support different

00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,640
workflows maybe some people want it

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,420
fully automated maybe other people want

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,760
a quick manual approval step so we need

00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,190
to be able to fit that into different

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,860
workflows but then we also need to

00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,110
account for what to do when things fail

00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,320
right so we need to have the opportunity

00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:33,870
or the ability to do a rollback if the

00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,940
update didn't work and so you know

00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:39,270
switching to new updated it may sound

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,590
easy but it's actually not that easy and

00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:44,160
so if we think about these four pieces

00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,170
the way we have been working on them you

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,180
can see on the screen so you know we've

00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,610
been working on integrity checks that's

00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,380
actually mostly done to manage the

00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,260
dependencies and download the updates

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,480
you want to switch from composer one to

00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,790
composer two they make that really the

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,130
core of that system which it's designed

00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:05,010
to do that and composer two comes with

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,500
some much-needed memory improvements

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,660
which

00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,190
you know why that is interesting to

00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,260
verify the updates we have a package

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:13,060
signing system that works in the

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,950
background with Drupal the doric that's

00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,619
mostly done and then to do the whole

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,740
switching to new updates we will be

00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,329
using a custom boot loader again I won't

00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,460
go into more details here but this

00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:26,740
should give you kind of an understanding

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,200
of the plan where we're at and then

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,180
hopefully also how you can get involved

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,780
we can help in each of these four work

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,940
streams we would love your help so if we

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,810
do that if we finish that I think that

00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,180
would be fantastic

00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:43,660
it will allow site owners to sleep well

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:47,109
at night it will reduce the maintenance

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:52,359
cost of Drupal and so I think it's a

00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:53,859
fantastic feature all right so there's a

00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,260
whole bunch of other things of course

00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:58,420
other than automated updates that we are

00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:02,320
working on and have been working on and

00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,109
these are very valuable these are you

00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,760
know I'm passionate about many of those

00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:09,010
however I decided not to include them

00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,970
here because I don't think they are the

00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:15,490
most important or the most strategic

00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,349
relative to sort of you know defining

00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,000
five strategic initiatives now that

00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:20,980
doesn't mean we should work on them we

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,440
should definitely keep working on them

00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,910
especially if you're passionate about it

00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,609
but it may mean that we're not

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:31,390
prioritizing all of the resources around

00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:33,520
them so for example the committee time

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,770
or the time that committers spent they

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,470
may prioritize other initiatives over

00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,270
these initiatives so wait times might be

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,480
a little bit longer and things like that

00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,740
but by all means we love this work and

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,700
keep working on it if you're passionate

00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:51,010
about it alright see these are the two

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,859
first buckets so now I'd like to move on

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:57,579
to the third bucket and that is to talk

00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:59,920
about things that users are asking us to

00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:02,800
do now the way to figure out what users

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,069
are asking you to do is to do a survey

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,819
and to do user research and so guess

00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:12,520
what we did a survey over 2000 people

00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:14,829
took the survey which is awesome it's a

00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,650
lot of data points and one of the things

00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:19,119
that we asked every participant to do is

00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,489
to self-identify

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,430
so we know sort of whoo you know took

00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:27,940
the survey so you can see you know

00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:30,819
there's back-end developers 50% of them

00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,999
identified as back-end developers their

00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:36,039
site builders and the difference between

00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:38,309
back-end developers and site builders

00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,170
just to be clear is that site builders

00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:43,239
tend to me more WYSIWYG and

00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,089
drag-and-drop write it so they don't

00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:48,249
necessarily open up an IDE to create a

00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:52,119
custom module they try to do things

00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:54,069
through the UI content creators and then

00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,869
sellers so sellers meaning those that

00:46:54,069 --> 00:47:00,880
help you know sell Drupal to potential

00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,619
users now if you do the math it doesn't

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,910
add up to a hundred it's actually over

00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:08,309
100 and that's simply because people can

00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:11,019
self-identify as more than one persona

00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:13,359
like a lot of content creators are also

00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:15,269
site builders some developers are both

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,609
back-end and front-end developers so

00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:22,900
that's why the total number is more than

00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:25,779
100 now what I did is for each of those

00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,690
personas I looked at the data and I

00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:31,150
looked at the top two requests for each

00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:33,269
of the personas and the way I filtered

00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:37,569
the data is that I looked at the top two

00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:39,999
has voted on by the persona so what that

00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:42,460
eliminates is maybe a content creator

00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:44,829
voting on you know back-end developer

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:48,789
features so I thought it was important

00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:52,420
to kind of use that filtering and then I

00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:54,059
also filtered by Drupal 8 experience so

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,039
quite a few people that took the survey

00:47:54,059 --> 00:48:00,579
had not used Drupal 8 yet because

00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,650
they're still on Drupal 7 and so if I

00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:05,259
didn't filter the data by Drupal 8

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,489
experience a lot of the requests would

00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:09,910
be for things that we've already

00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:13,869
implemented you know try Drupal 8 in

00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:17,650
Drupal 9 right so that's why I filter

00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:20,589
the data this way so it's basically as

00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,749
an example you know what do back-end

00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:25,599
developers experience with Drupal 8

00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:27,519
asked to do for other back-end

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,329
developers that's the idea if you look

00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,309
at the data

00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:32,049
there's actually quite a bit of data

00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:32,930
points for each of those personas

00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:36,410
hundreds

00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:39,619
answers that we considered and then what

00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,990
I did quite simply and by the way I will

00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:44,359
make all of these data available and all

00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:48,319
of the details so you can do your own

00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:50,630
analysis but this is my analysis and so

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,430
then what I did is I basically put the

00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,200
stock two requests for each of the

00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:57,410
personas in a table and so I'm gonna

00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,990
reveal it to you now I'll go you know

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,900
bottom to top to build up some

00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,089
suspension given that a lot of you are

00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:07,010
back in developers but sellers they

00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:09,530
basically asked for things that help

00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,599
them demo Drupal and the number one

00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:14,119
thing was a better looking

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,809
administration theme and the second

00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:19,400
thing was out-of-the-box integrations

00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:21,559
specifically integrations with marketing

00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,260
technologies because that's what

00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,819
end-users tend to ask for they want to

00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,740
see that Drupal can do the things that

00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:30,140
they want to do and that it looks good

00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:33,140
and that it's easy to use so no real

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,690
surprise there content creators also

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,660
asked for a more modern administration

00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,030
UI and you know one that's responsive

00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,700
and snappy and sort of application like

00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:45,859
and then they also asked for easier to

00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:49,030
use page building tools so despite the

00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:52,339
layout builder they want even more

00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,960
easy-to-use page building tools that

00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:56,900
could be improvements to the layout

00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,140
builder but also I think out of the box

00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:03,579
blocks like maybe to add a title or an

00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:06,369
image or different components on pages

00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:09,109
so that's content creators so moving up

00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:13,400
site builders they asked for automated

00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:16,430
updates and more modules in core now the

00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,890
more modules in core is interesting and

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:22,130
we did have a little bit of a follow-up

00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:27,170
research on this and the reason why is

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:30,260
really many fault one is you know 80% of

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:32,059
the websites use you know very similar

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,559
modules and people are a little bit

00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:35,869
tired of having to download these

00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,720
modules and install them they just want

00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:40,490
them to be there but also by adding them

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,130
to core it removes some of the

00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,079
maintenance burden it makes it easier to

00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,760
update those modules and so actually

00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:50,900
some of that could be fixed

00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:53,360
by automated updates in core next

00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:58,160
front-end developers they asked us to

00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,960
modernize the JavaScript in core and you

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,360
know to look at JavaScript frameworks

00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:05,630
they also asked for a component based

00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,700
theme system and I won't go into the

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,100
details of what that is here but more

00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,850
modern way of building and designing

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:17,330
front ends last but not least back-end

00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:19,460
developers they asked for improved API

00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,430
documentation that was a number one ask

00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:26,420
and we did have a question in the survey

00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:29,360
that was kind of a deep dive on that

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,480
specifically and what this was about

00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:36,260
was actually less about the quality of

00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,030
the API documentation it was all about

00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,520
the discoverability and the search

00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,320
ability of the API documentation so

00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,470
that's what we learned from the survey

00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:48,200
again the details are in the detailed

00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,330
survey results but it just wanted to be

00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,820
easier to find the documentation that we

00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,370
have and the second thing was to replace

00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:58,220
the hook system with events and this one

00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,570
actually made me smile because you know

00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,510
years ago this was a little bit

00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,310
controversial where most people loft the

00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,330
hook system now people want the event

00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:09,980
system and I think that's great because

00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:13,000
it means two things one their serve a

00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:18,200
general interest in moving away from old

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,660
Drupal isms but also I think people want

00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,790
one system versus two system so cleaning

00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,480
that up is important for the developer

00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:29,150
experience no doubt so these are the top

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,070
juice for each of the personas now you

00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,440
may wonder what didn't make the list

00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,970
because some of the and some of the

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,460
questions in the survey have you know

00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,920
more than ten different options so a lot

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:42,710
of things didn't make the list I won't

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,920
go through them all here I'll put them

00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:48,590
on this slide so if you're watching a

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,050
recording you can hit pause you can read

00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:54,170
a little bit more about them here to see

00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:57,460
what they didn't make the list now next

00:52:54,170 --> 00:53:00,290
I wanted to look at what beginners

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,540
versus experts are asking for

00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:05,720
and for me that was important because of

00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:08,690
what I said earlier the need to really

00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,360
focus on the beginner experience based

00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:14,390
on the research presented in Amsterdam

00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,690
and so what I did is this I basically

00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:20,900
came up with this star system where I

00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:23,960
would have two stars when half or more

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:26,780
of the respondents of the survey said

00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,790
drop everything that you're doing and do

00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,500
this which if you think about it more

00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:32,960
than half of the people that took the

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,240
survey were extremely passionate about

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,210
it so two stars is an incredible

00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:42,560
endorsement - for a feature or a feature

00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:44,450
request I gave something one star if one

00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,450
out of three people said drop everything

00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:50,900
and do this which still is an incredible

00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:53,830
endorsement for a particular feature and

00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:56,570
not everything on this list got a star

00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,520
and so when you do that for both

00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:03,080
beginners and experts you can actually

00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:05,330
see not only what do these personas have

00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:09,310
conviction for but also is there a

00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:11,990
consensus or a lack of consensus between

00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,480
you know beginners and experts and so if

00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:17,630
you fill that out it looks something

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,810
like this and if you look at the data

00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:23,870
you can see that clearly automated

00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:26,510
updates is the number one it's the only

00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:30,490
one that has two stars for beginner and

00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:32,900
expert so a lot of conviction from both

00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:35,930
experience levels and also a lot of

00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,170
consensus because both of them really

00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:42,470
want this the number two is clearly a

00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:47,840
modern administration UI it has the most

00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:50,870
stars next to you know automated updates

00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:54,200
and it also came back in to persona so

00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:57,110
what I did is I put all of those you

00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:00,170
know top feature requests in this bucket

00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:02,660
and I added two stars - automated

00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:06,890
updates and one star to a modern admin

00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:09,740
UI and I did that sorry just as a

00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:11,650
reminder so we don't forget about what

00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,040
had the most votes

00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,110
you know based

00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,970
based on the survey all right so next

00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:20,400
the fourth bucket is things that we must

00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:22,710
do to attract new users and for drupal

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,830
to stay relevant for the next decades

00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,540
let's say there's this longer term and

00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:29,430
you know there's nothing new here i've

00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,420
been talking about this for many many

00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,570
years actually and as recently as

00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,240
DrupalCon

00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:39,030
amsterdam where have you know reminded

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:42,390
people that we are evolving from a

00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:45,000
browser only world where a CMS was a

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:48,240
standalone application where he did

00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,910
manual entry of content and it would

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,950
generate an HTML page for HTML pages

00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,930
you know we're evolving from that world

00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:58,290
to something much more complex something

00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:01,020
much more rich where you have many

00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:03,020
different integrations with back in

00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:06,710
technology and marketing technology

00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:10,230
weary of many different output channels

00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:13,500
not only you know web pages HTML pages

00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,330
but mobile applications chat voice you

00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,250
know you name it and all of that happens

00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,640
in many different formats you know could

00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:23,580
be JSON the XML could obviously be HTML

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,100
too and that's really where the world

00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:29,160
continues to go and as I mentioned I

00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,110
believe this is a multi-decade trends

00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,270
you know we're years into this so this

00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:35,070
is nothing new but I think we have a

00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:37,980
long way to go and I think we should

00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:40,380
expect an acceleration of this trend as

00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,810
well just to put that in perspective you

00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:46,170
know one data point today there's about

00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:48,750
20 billion devices and it's expected

00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,930
that in less than 10 years there will be

00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,640
300 billion devices connected to the

00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,920
Internet

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,590
generating data with or without this

00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,040
place but you know just an explosion of

00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,990
content and explosion of data and so

00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,600
that's why it's really important for

00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:09,060
Drupal to continue to evolve from a web

00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,850
content management to what I call a

00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,270
Content repository to more of a

00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:18,120
structured data engine where we need to

00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,520
think about you know supporting more

00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,100
kinds of different content maybe binary

00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,830
content even where we need to think

00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,390
about it managing much more content than

00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:29,010
we've ever managed just

00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,799
more volume of content not only

00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:34,079
different kinds of content and where we

00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:36,299
need to make it really really easy to

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,910
integrate with both these vacuum systems

00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:41,880
and these front-end systems and so the

00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:43,920
integration part is really important you

00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,890
know back-end and front-end integrations

00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,859
now in addition to that there's actually

00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:53,059
another important trends Ana Trent is a

00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:57,210
front-end developers don't always love

00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:58,079
PHP you know even though PHP is faster

00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,660
than ever before

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:04,109
even though PHP is better and richer

00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,700
than ever before front-end developers

00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:07,849
don't always love it

00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,349
right so and if you look at the numbers

00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:14,190
while PHP is vast

00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:15,799
while PHP powers like almost 80% of all

00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,690
of the websites in the world which is

00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:22,019
incredible the numbers are starting to

00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:24,240
decline and if you compare them to the

00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:27,180
JavaScript numbers you can see in this

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,400
case you know react that the adoption of

00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,980
JavaScript and react is literally

00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:36,150
exploding and it doesn't look like it's

00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:38,519
gonna stop any time soon the same is

00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:42,150
true actually for other frameworks like

00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,859
view you can see view same thing growth

00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:47,190
is of the charge then if you put them

00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:49,470
next to each other you can see them you

00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:52,230
know PHP styl like what ten times or

00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:54,750
more than ten times bigger then react on

00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:57,059
almost you know ten times bigger than

00:58:54,750 --> 00:59:02,220
react and view together so there's no

00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:05,160
reason to panic PHP is strong but you

00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:08,160
know I do think we should really look at

00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:10,259
embracing more JavaScript in Drupal

00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,140
especially for the front-end and this

00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:15,420
made me think if I were to start Drupal

00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:19,349
today you know almost twenty years after

00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:21,930
I started rupal if I were if I were to

00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:24,329
start today I would write the front end

00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,609
in JavaScript to be quite honest I

00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:30,240
wouldn't write it in PHP now it's a

00:59:26,609 --> 00:59:32,339
different story for the back end I may

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,440
not write the back end in JavaScript but

00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:36,720
the front end to me with all of the

00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,420
richness of the JavaScript community all

00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,349
the components that they have to build

00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,959
from thence it feels like a no Bray

00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:46,449
to to do that so I put JavaScript and

00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:50,469
web services on the list and so this is

00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:52,329
the list right so this is the 10 and you

00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:54,569
know the list of initiatives that I

00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:58,719
think we should consider and so now

00:59:54,569 --> 01:00:00,489
let's select 5 which is a hard part so

00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,130
what I did is that just kind of flip

01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:05,709
this on its head if you will and I

01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:10,269
created these empty slots for five

01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:10,660
initiatives to consider alright are you

01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:15,190
ready

01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:18,160
um so for me the first three initiatives

01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:20,259
are actually no-brainers you know we

01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,890
have to get ready for Drupal 10 we have

01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:28,029
to make sure that Drupal is secure so we

01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:31,150
have to manage these components the next

01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:33,579
two easy out-of-the-box a new front and

01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:35,979
theme I believe they're so important

01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:39,729
that we're so close we need to finish

01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:41,559
them it's the right thing to do it's

01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:44,229
like we're so close to the finish line

01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:46,839
and pushing it over the finish line is

01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:49,119
where we unlock the real value of all of

01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:53,589
the work which is improving that

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:57,249
beginner experience so yeah for me these

01:00:53,589 --> 01:01:00,609
are really important at afford one I

01:00:57,249 --> 01:01:03,160
also think is obvious you know we have

01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:05,920
been working on it and it's by far the

01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,199
number one request you know by far the

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,640
number one feature request so automated

01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:16,859
updates in my mind has to be item number

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:19,749
four and not only is it useful for

01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:22,299
security updates and hopefully other

01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:25,329
updates I actually do believe it's very

01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:29,440
strategic if you think about what we're

01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:31,779
doing you know I've been pushing for

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,930
this idea of the assembled web which

01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:36,599
nowadays people call you know composable

01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:40,329
architectures where you can basically

01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:42,640
you know mix and match modules to build

01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:44,979
different kinds of applications in a

01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,630
very composable way sort of like LEGO

01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:49,059
pieces which is exactly how people

01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:50,769
describe Drupal so we have a real

01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:54,849
strengths there but if we could make it

01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:55,310
easier to manage all of these components

01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:57,620
and to

01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:59,930
datum it really could accelerate this

01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,540
vision of the assembled web or

01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,940
composable architectures and if you

01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:08,060
think about what could come after this

01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:11,990
is not just automated updates but also

01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:14,120
making it easier to you know find and

01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:16,730
install modules where you've like a

01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,980
marshal browser from within Drupal and

01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:21,200
maybe a distribution browser from within

01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:24,200
Drupal I think now we take a lot of

01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,880
complexity out of Drupal and getting

01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,730
started with Drupal so really good for

01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:32,030
beginners but really also long-term

01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:34,940
strategic in terms of you know ease of

01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:36,530
use flexibility composable architecture

01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,680
so I'm actually pretty excited about

01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:43,280
that for more than one reason

01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:46,370
so now last but not least again I have

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:49,730
to go with the vote of the users which

01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:52,600
is a modern admin UI they got the second

01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:56,840
most votes after automated updates I

01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:59,000
think it's really important so let's

01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,850
talk about that so some of you may

01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,990
remember we actually had an initiative

01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:08,360
to modernize Drupal's admin UI and we

01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:11,540
actually did a lot of great work we

01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:14,630
identified sort of all of the parts and

01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,610
we identified what was hard and easy we

01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:19,070
did prototyping and I think even showed

01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:21,920
some of these prototypes in previous

01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:27,050
Drees notes or Drupal con presentations

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:29,600
and we set various things in motion but

01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:32,540
we also learned in doing all of that

01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,940
work that the scope is very very large

01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,570
that redesigning the complete

01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:41,030
administration UI is a lot of work and

01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:43,100
so you know we should have known better

01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:45,980
and that includes me and all of the core

01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,780
committers that this was huge but I'm

01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:49,910
still very grateful of all of the work

01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,340
that we've done because the fact that we

01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:54,710
learned so much and so if you think

01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,330
about the scope there's all these pieces

01:03:54,710 --> 01:04:00,020
that we had to do which may not be

01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:02,660
obvious at first but we identified a

01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,430
number of architectural changes we need

01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,740
to make some of them pretty hard like

01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:09,060
how do you validate configuration

01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:13,680
entities as an example

01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:15,900
and then we identified that we had not

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,670
complete coverage obviously with our web

01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,010
service API is and that we needed to add

01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:22,050
a lot of web service API is and we did

01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,630
that and some of that lives in contrib

01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:27,060
and all of these things are necessary to

01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:30,300
even begin to redesign the

01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:32,610
administration UI using JavaScript

01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:35,550
components which is what we want to use

01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:38,550
and so you know good progress was made

01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:41,340
but we don't have a new admin UI to show

01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:44,550
for because it was just so large and so

01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:47,010
what I'd like to propose next is that we

01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:49,200
actually kind of pivot and that we

01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:52,680
reduce the scope and that we take a

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,460
small but specific step to set this

01:04:52,680 --> 01:05:01,800
admin UI work in motion and I'll explain

01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:04,110
what I mean by that so first of all if

01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,340
you go back to this slide there's all

01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:09,660
these pieces and you know obviously

01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:11,220
we're not showing you all of the details

01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:14,370
but the way I think we should go about

01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:17,070
it is is basically follow the Pareto

01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:19,350
principle which effectively says that

01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:22,020
you should focus on the most impactful

01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,790
problem first and then once you solve

01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,300
that problem you move on to the next

01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:27,030
problem

01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,640
eventually you arrive serve at the

01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:30,540
finish line after you solved most or all

01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,730
of your problems

01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,770
now actually think we solved some of the

01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,480
biggest problems already in my mind

01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:40,380
that's getting content in and out of

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,300
Drupal which we did by adding the JSON

01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,580
API module but if I think about what

01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:49,380
could be the next biggest problem in

01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:51,480
terms of impact I think it's menus you

01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,210
know if you think about all of the sites

01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:58,530
and applications that exist almost all

01:05:54,210 --> 01:06:00,360
of them have a menu to navigate it's

01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:02,400
also really hard for JavaScript

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,770
developers you know because you have to

01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,170
think about hierarchies some of these

01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:09,510
menu items may be module defines or

01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:12,060
programmatic if you will some of them

01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:14,990
are user-defined you have to think about

01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:18,660
pad aliases access control I mean menus

01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:21,420
sound easy but they're actually really

01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:25,630
hard and as a result

01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:28,750
most applications hard-code them like

01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:30,700
nobody built them to be sort of dynamic

01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,799
they're all hard-coded because frankly

01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:37,030
there is no web service API in Drupal

01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:38,890
for managing menus and when I looked at

01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:42,039
some of the competitors they don't have

01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:44,680
an elegant solution for this either so

01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:48,099
it seems like there is an opportunity to

01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:50,079
solve menus so that you know you don't

01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:51,430
have to resort to hard coding them which

01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,549
you know it looks a little bit like this

01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:56,980
where a developer has to check out the

01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:58,990
project make code changes you know

01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,640
commit those and then you know deploy

01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:03,190
them and go through the whole deployment

01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:07,210
process along the way so you know there

01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:10,240
has to be a better way and for us CMS

01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:11,470
experts it's not that hard to imagine

01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,200
what that would look like

01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:18,880
meaning the better way is for in this

01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:21,190
case our June to be able to make changes

01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,230
through the menu in the Drupal back-end

01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:26,200
and then have these changes

01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:28,779
automatically reflected in the front-end

01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,410
application like this is what everybody

01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:34,599
expects a CMS to do yet in the headless

01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:38,099
CMS world and in Drupal

01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:41,500
this isn't solved properly right and so

01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:45,789
we can solve this we would empower our

01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:48,220
June and obviously you know and Maya too

01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:51,520
because she wouldn't have to do this all

01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:55,539
the time right and so specifically I

01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:59,049
believe our mission should be to provide

01:07:55,539 --> 01:08:03,400
the best way for JavaScript front ends

01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:05,890
to consume configurable menus managed in

01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,470
Drupal now that's a lot so let me break

01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:11,380
that down and help you understand what I

01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:14,940
think we should do I believe we should

01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:17,890
have an official component for react and

01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,270
ship an official component for react I

01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:22,239
believe we should have an official

01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:24,819
component for view as well so that we

01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,859
are not dependent on one framework and

01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:28,839
that we can build this with you know

01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:30,549
abstraction in mind and I think we

01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:32,560
should really think about the developer

01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:34,469
experience and specifically the

01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,749
front-end developer experience

01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:39,210
so that we deliver it in a way that they

01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:42,239
expect it to be delivered which I

01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:45,210
imagine is true NPM you know the way

01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,599
other components are made available to

01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:47,489
them

01:08:45,599 --> 01:08:49,409
when building an application and if we

01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:51,599
do this well we could have another

01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:53,009
advantage over some of the headless

01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:54,749
CMS's and actually have a better

01:08:53,009 --> 01:09:00,960
developer experience and a better end

01:08:54,749 --> 01:09:04,979
user experience now for some this may

01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,019
sound like maybe a small step right

01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:09,029
aa-men use is that really that

01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:11,880
interesting and I think it actually is

01:09:09,029 --> 01:09:15,059
really interesting because in reality

01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,549
and I alluded to this menus are pretty

01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:20,639
hard right not only do you need to add

01:09:17,549 --> 01:09:22,589
more web service API coverage for menus

01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:24,779
but you really need to figure out how to

01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:27,539
manage these different kinds of menus

01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:30,029
and hierarchies and when you're talking

01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:32,159
about menus you can't ignore things like

01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:35,219
pad aliasing and routing because when

01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:38,219
you click on a menu item you expect to

01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:40,559
navigate to another page so it really

01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:44,039
kind of pulls out some of the harder

01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:46,589
pieces to figure out and then maybe the

01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:50,219
hardest part is figuring out how we

01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:52,199
actually make an official component how

01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:55,590
do we go about testing JavaScript

01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:57,420
components what about documentation how

01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:59,969
do we create these packages how do we do

01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:02,099
release management for respect jiz what

01:09:59,969 --> 01:10:04,739
about security what about the

01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:07,170
dependencies on other JavaScript's

01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:10,320
packages and so there's just a lot to

01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:12,749
figure out so while it sounds easy to do

01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,400
menus I think it's actually quite a bit

01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:19,409
of work now menus I think are a real

01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,590
problem and I think it's actually a

01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:24,840
problem that many front-end developers

01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:28,469
have but what I'm actually more excited

01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,989
about is all the things that it sets in

01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:33,090
motion for drupal specifically so if you

01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:35,400
think about it what we're going to do

01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:40,139
with this first official components

01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:41,999
menus is establish a clear pattern and a

01:10:40,139 --> 01:10:45,900
pattern that can be repeated think of it

01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:48,320
as a recipe or a playbook right once we

01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:50,810
figure out how to build one

01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,179
opponents and how to manage a component

01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,940
and release a component and package and

01:10:53,179 --> 01:10:58,219
desta components we can really start

01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:01,159
building many more components in

01:10:58,219 --> 01:11:03,320
parallel all following the same pattern

01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:05,780
so if we can enable all of the

01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:09,560
contributed modules to build components

01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:12,770
in a uniform way make it part of our

01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,320
tools and workflows I really I I would

01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:17,449
expect to see a lot more components

01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:20,030
components for blocks and forums and

01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:22,239
shopping carts and maybe carousels and

01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:24,170
views and toolbars you know you name it

01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:26,630
and once we have enough of these

01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:31,000
components we'll be in a much better

01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:33,380
position to start improving the admin UI

01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,340
right if you think about building our

01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:39,440
own admin UI well we have menus too in

01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:42,139
the admin UI so that's an example of a

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,239
component we could use we're also using

01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:46,159
views in the admin UI if there was a

01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:50,630
good component reviews we would be able

01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:53,179
to use that too and so again it's what

01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:55,790
it sets in motion which is so exciting

01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:58,670
to me and for me ultimately it actually

01:11:55,790 --> 01:12:01,369
solves a very big what I call industry

01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,290
problem a problem that everybody has and

01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:05,389
by solving it we can be the best the

01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:07,869
couple CMS in the market and let me

01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:10,460
explain what that means today

01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:12,320
we often have to make trade-offs if you

01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,750
go with a headless or decoupled approach

01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,909
you're really optimizing for the

01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:18,619
developer experience because you allow

01:12:16,909 --> 01:12:20,840
the developer to use Java Script which

01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:23,659
is what the majority of front-end

01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,869
developers outside of Drupal typically

01:12:23,659 --> 01:12:29,480
want to use but when you do that you

01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:32,000
really compromise what I call the non

01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,520
developer experience the site builder

01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,409
and the content author because they lose

01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,360
things like menu management but also

01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:42,530
layouts and previews and many other

01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:44,599
things right and there's other modes

01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,489
like progressive decoupling and really

01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:49,159
that's not the ideal solution either

01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:51,770
because as a front-end developer now you

01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:54,349
have to learn both Twigg and JavaScript

01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:56,719
because you know that's what progressive

01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:59,570
decoupling means and so the question is

01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,270
can we build something that doesn't

01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:04,430
compromise one persona

01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:06,740
that you know is both a positive

01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:08,510
experience and I think we can if you

01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:12,830
think about the menus if we can build a

01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:14,330
menu component that can be used by a

01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:18,080
front-end developer but that then

01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:20,180
connects into Drupal to generate you

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,000
know the menu or the content of the menu

01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:25,160
it would be a win-win for both personas

01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,530
and that would be a big deal

01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,150
and I've been blogging about this for a

01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:32,210
couple of years and you may have seen

01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:36,380
some of my blog posts in those I put

01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:38,000
these complicated flowcharts to help you

01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:40,250
know people decide should they go with

01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,340
couple decouples you know or something

01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,630
in between and there might be an

01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:49,280
opportunity to get rid of those

01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:53,450
flowcharts or at least make the choice a

01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:56,150
lot easier or not as dramatic so an

01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:58,190
official JavaScript components an

01:13:56,150 --> 01:14:00,230
official react an official view

01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:02,930
JavaScript component we've never had

01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:06,620
this would be a first in the lifetime of

01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:09,080
Drupal in 20 years of Drupal and I think

01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:11,930
it's actually a giant leap for Drupal to

01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,890
add the first official component so what

01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:18,080
I am proposing is that we don't do the

01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:20,810
modern administration UI that we learned

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:24,170
from the past that that is too big of a

01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:27,380
scope and that instead we focus on a

01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:29,930
JavaScript menu component to make that

01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:33,230
first step and to you know set that

01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:35,390
snowball in motion to make that start

01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:37,520
rolling and if you think about it a

01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:39,860
little bit more it's actually very

01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,470
strategic for other reasons because I

01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,660
believe it allows us to make some

01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:47,480
progress on some of these other

01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:49,310
important initiatives it really connects

01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,780
into a lot of things it helps us

01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:54,470
modernize JavaScript

01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:57,170
it helps us evolve into a component

01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:59,450
based theming approach it improves web

01:14:57,170 --> 01:15:02,420
services because we have to add more API

01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:04,790
coverage and eventually I think it can

01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:09,410
me to ease your page building and a more

01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:12,320
modern administration UI so I'm not

01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:14,690
saying it solves these initiatives what

01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,790
I'm saying is it helps us make some

01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,400
important part

01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:21,280
so I think of the JavaScript menu

01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:24,070
component initiative as you know very

01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,080
strategic actually as I just explained

01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:28,510
in the last five to 10 minutes so here's

01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,300
the five proposed initiatives that I

01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:33,250
think we should discuss and consider and

01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,350
I've had an opportunity to run them by

01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:37,990
the core committers and they're on board

01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:41,080
and I talked to some others about this

01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:44,110
as well but open for feedback by all

01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,850
means and I believe they're well

01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,170
balanced you know as I said in the

01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,820
beginning we need to make sure they're

01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:51,220
well balanced I think they help with

01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:53,590
technical debt and innovation I think

01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,180
we're looking at different stakeholders

01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:58,330
beginners and experts but also

01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:00,670
developers and non developers and you

01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:04,060
know making progress to be a great

01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:06,760
headless and decoupled CMS in addition

01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:10,750
to be a great traditional CMS this

01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:13,390
approach of API first but not API only I

01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:15,340
think if organizations and individuals

01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:18,100
are very clear reason to adopt and I

01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:21,100
think it puts us on a path to be

01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:23,440
long-term relevant last but not least I

01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:28,030
think it's hard work it's a lot of work

01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:30,340
but also achievable maybe a stretch a

01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:33,730
slight stretch but it feels achievable

01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:35,710
in the next 16 months to make some

01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,890
growth progress I would actually love to

01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:41,170
see a stake like a flying start if you

01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:43,630
will with the JavaScript menu components

01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:45,910
imagine we could add a first component

01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:48,070
in Drupal 9.2

01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:51,520
maybe we can get some more components in

01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:54,070
by 9.3 I know this is a little bit

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,610
wishful thinking but um it might be

01:16:54,070 --> 01:17:00,490
worth a shot so you know we have to get

01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:02,740
organized around this we don't have all

01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:05,380
the details figured out or we haven't

01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:07,330
made plans for everything we need

01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:10,050
initiative leads for each of these

01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:14,080
things in some cases we already have

01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:16,960
leads in other cases not and we've also

01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:19,540
learned that it helps to have a main

01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,270
sponsor and a main sponsor is an

01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:25,770
organization or someone who provides

01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:28,960
resources usually time and talent

01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,239
sometimes money to to help drive the

01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,380
initiative

01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,239
you know with the help of others

01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:37,000
including volunteers so they don't have

01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,830
to do all of the work but they are you

01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,139
know the main sponsor so we're also

01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:44,440
looking for main sponsors if you're

01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:47,530
interested we have contribution tables

01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:50,110
at these events you see the link at the

01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:51,639
bottom of the page you can join those

01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:55,710
and raise your hand and it will help

01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:58,030
welcome you and help you get involved so

01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:59,830
if you want to learn more about some of

01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:01,480
these things that I just talked about we

01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:04,540
actually have a lot of sessions on these

01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:07,739
topics you can see them here some of

01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:11,500
them are tomorrow some of them are

01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:14,830
Thursday by all means if you're excited

01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:16,510
about this please do get involved and if

01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:18,429
you do this well I think the Drupal 10

01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:21,429
press release could be you know pretty

01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:24,610
exciting and so kind of drafted one so

01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:28,630
let me try and read it to you okay here

01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:31,449
we go this would be June 2020 to Drupal

01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:33,429
10 extends Drupal strength in headless

01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:35,650
or decoupled applications and for

01:18:33,429 --> 01:18:38,469
developers that means that Drupal 10

01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:41,650
simplifies the development of JavaScript

01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:44,530
applications Drupal allows developers to

01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:47,139
user framework of choice but it ships

01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:50,560
with out-of-the-box support for react

01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:52,389
and view for marketers this means that

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,199
Drupal 10 allows the building of

01:18:52,389 --> 01:18:56,889
omni-channel

01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:59,739
digital experiences without giving up

01:18:56,889 --> 01:19:02,530
the ease of use marketers and content

01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:05,530
creators expect this makes Drupal the

01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:08,920
best decouple CMS for less technical

01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:10,900
users Drupal 10 also ships with

01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,150
automatic automated updates this makes

01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:15,099
it drastically easier to maintain Drupal

01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:18,340
sites and up and to apply security

01:19:15,099 --> 01:19:21,400
updates it also advances drupal support

01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,580
for composable architectures like Drupal

01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:27,340
9 Drupal 10 continued its focus on

01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:29,679
improving the beginner experience with a

01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:32,500
new look and feel and an improved

01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:34,599
out-of-the-box experience I think that

01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:37,150
could be great if you can achieve all of

01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:40,090
that in two years I think that's worth

01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:43,240
another celebration so if you are

01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:46,390
excited about this please help I really

01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:49,810
do you believe that it's not only fun to

01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:52,480
work on but it's also really an

01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:55,390
opportunity to have a positive impact on

01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,600
the world with that I'd like to thank

01:19:55,390 --> 01:20:01,630
you I will make the slides available on

01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:04,210
my site I will make the survey data

01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:07,150
available on my site I probably need a

01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:09,940
week or so to do that because this week

01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:12,460
is pretty busy I will not be taking

01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:16,180
questions right now but we have a

01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:18,490
dedicated 45 minutes Q&A session

01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:20,290
tomorrow so if you have questions if you

01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:22,180
want to talk about this more or other

01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:26,580
things you can ask questions about

01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:29,830
anything please join the Q&A session

01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:32,740
tomorrow all right well thank you very

01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:34,630
much thank you dreams and thank you

01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:37,270
everybody who listens into the DRI's

01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:38,770
notes my name is Tim Lennon you probably

01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:40,780
saw me at the welcome session this

01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:43,750
morning I'm the CTO here for the Drupal

01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:45,430
Association and I wanted to spend just a

01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:46,960
couple of minutes here in an outro

01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:49,240
saying thank you to everyone who was

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,830
here and also reflecting on and

01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,630
bookending something that happened at

01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:54,250
the beginning of the presentation so

01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:56,740
I'll actually share a slide or two in

01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:58,660
just a moment when we get there but

01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,310
first I do want to thank I have the

01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:04,270
rocker executive director of the Drupal

01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:08,350
Association for her initial presentation

01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:10,090
for all of us and for talking about the

01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:12,670
initiatives being led by the Drupal

01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:15,030
Association to support the community

01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:17,650
I want to thank Fatima for a wonderful

01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:21,010
handoff and introduction to the DRI's

01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:22,840
note it was really a great conversation

01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,690
and some wonderful memories about Drupal

01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:28,330
cons past but now I'd like to spend just

01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:29,770
a moment of reflection we made a large

01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:32,860
theme of both the Drupal Association

01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:35,830
update and Jesus update diversity and

01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:37,000
inclusion in the Drupal community and I

01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:41,200
wanted to share some personal

01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,520
reflections on this subject because I've

01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:46,000
had a little bit of a personal journey

01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,030
with this issue before and after my time

01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:53,590
with Drupal and the Drupal Association

01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:55,020
so let me share just a slide or two with

01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,950
you to close us out today

01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:01,990
and I'll share

01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:05,020
a bit of a story so my name is is Tim

01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:07,030
Lennon I'm just a I'm a sis white guy in

01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:09,640
the Drupal community so why am I here to

01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:11,950
talk about diversity inclusion in the

01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:14,170
outro I'm here to talk because I've

01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:16,060
learned three skills recently that I

01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:17,830
think are really critical and important

01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:20,680
for all of us who believe in the value

01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:22,840
and who believe in those values in our

01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,900
daily lives in our work lives and

01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:28,630
everywhere so I think those skills

01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:30,130
really represent the the three skills

01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:35,230
represent the ability to be vulnerable

01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:37,930
the ability to be empathetic and the

01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:39,730
ability to be an ally so I want to talk

01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:42,580
briefly about those so first

01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:45,400
vulnerability for myself

01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:48,070
vulnerability means being able to talk

01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,510
to all of you who know me as a technical

01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,570
individual as someone who leads

01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:54,430
initiatives for the Drupal Association

01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,900
and works on drupal.org to talk about

01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:58,680
something that's outside my comfort zone

01:22:55,900 --> 01:23:02,380
and frankly outside of my expertise

01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:03,850
empathy means understanding the needs

01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,230
and wants of people around me

01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:07,540
understanding where people are coming

01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:09,250
from and looking to my own experience

01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,650
and experience of others to learn from

01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,510
it I'm gonna share some fairly personal

01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:16,150
stories about that in just a second and

01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:18,100
then Ally ship means understanding how

01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:20,380
to take action in a way that supports

01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:25,000
the community rather than relying on a

01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:27,160
community to do work for you so on the

01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,930
note of being vulnerable it's it's

01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,480
always difficult to talk about I'll

01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:34,600
share two two ways that I've learned

01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:38,290
empathy over the course of my my recent

01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:41,950
life and later career in in college at

01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:44,620
Reid here in Portland Oregon I was part

01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:46,960
of a household and kind of community

01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:51,670
that was very close with the transgender

01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:53,410
community on campus we had housemates

01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:56,680
and things like that rotated and out of

01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:59,380
ours and several other campus houses for

01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,090
folks who needed it for folks who were

01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:03,880
perhaps going through transition and

01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:05,200
other sorts of things and my best friend

01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:09,160
that I grew up with was part of that

01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,750
community and I learned a lot from

01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,760
living with

01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:15,100
that community of people and talking

01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,520
with these people who were were and are

01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:22,680
some of my closest friends

01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:29,560
unfortunately my best friend died in

01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:32,520
2009 in an accident and since then I

01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:35,590
have been honoring and remembering her

01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:39,340
by finding ways to be involved as an

01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:40,630
ally and active in this community and to

01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,980
bring it to the other things that I do

01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:45,070
and the other parts of mine

01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:48,250
my passions more recently when watching

01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:51,010
the protests all around the United

01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:53,200
States and around the world I and my

01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:56,770
wife went out to the Portland

01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:59,230
blacklivesmatter event and went there to

01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:00,790
bear witness and participate with what

01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:03,250
was going on in the community and

01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:06,910
support the community listened to the

01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:08,380
land acknowledgments and the given by

01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,900
the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs

01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:13,150
here in Oregon listen to the founder of

01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:17,020
the Portland black Black Panthers speak

01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:19,120
about their experience and it was very

01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:22,030
meaningful and very difficult to someone

01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,010
who often feels like there may be part

01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:26,230
of the problem to understand how to be

01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,270
part of the solution so to talk about

01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:31,510
good Ally ship for just a moment what

01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:33,520
that means to me is understanding the

01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:36,780
experience of others listening to their

01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:40,120
voices elevating their voices and

01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:43,780
knowing knowing how to engage and how to

01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,990
help in a productive way so just to talk

01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,380
a little bit about that engagement

01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:49,420
Heather

01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,980
our executive director injuries both

01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:53,260
talked about various initiatives that

01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:55,300
are going on and one of the most

01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,070
important kind of principles behind this

01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:59,020
right whether it's our internal Drupal

01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:00,640
Association training or whether it's

01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,080
partnering with Drupal diversity and

01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,880
inclusion to bring a code of conduct

01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:07,000
training to the community or to provide

01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:08,860
booth space or whether it's just changes

01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,620
to our own hiring practices or things

01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:13,030
like that is that everybody has actions

01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:15,280
of their own that they can take within

01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:17,230
an organization and that is part of good

01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,180
Ally ship and the other part of good

01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:21,280
Ally ship is knowing how to engage your

01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:24,410
community so the Drupal diversity and

01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:27,290
inclusion group is a self-organized part

01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:29,240
the Drupal community that has existed

01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:31,900
for I believe it's around four years

01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,940
three or four years now and has been

01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:38,090
organizing ad hoc speaker trainings and

01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:40,460
other events it's not in the official

01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:43,370
higher hierarchy of Drupal governance

01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,260
it's a totally independent group and I

01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:47,440
have found a lot of value from regularly

01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,360
attending conversations with that group

01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,920
I've certainly found places where we've

01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,780
been in disagreement as well and that's

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:57,200
okay too as long as we know how to do it

01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:59,690
respectfully one of the things that I do

01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,260
want to say though is that if you are an

01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:06,230
ally or someone who wants to be an ally

01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:09,620
seeking out support seeking people who

01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:12,170
are maybe more experts than yourself ask

01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:13,700
for help but don't expect that help but

01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:15,830
don't expect people to do the work of

01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:18,200
educating you for you so if you have

01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:21,500
some issue where you have a significant

01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:23,180
diversity or inclusion concern and you

01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,090
want to engage some a group within the

01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:28,100
Drupal community like didi and I you

01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:30,170
know engage upfront ask if they'd be

01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:31,520
interested in participating but don't

01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:33,620
come to them with a problem that's

01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,290
already happened and asked them to solve

01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,550
it for you right it's about engaging in

01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:40,790
a way that shows thoughtfulness that

01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:44,930
shows your own education and willingness

01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:46,460
to participate so also don't depend

01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:48,040
solely on that group there's a group of

01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:49,910
great people who want to be

01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:52,910
participating in helping this community

01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:54,260
as a whole but everybody can do this

01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:56,570
work everybody can participate

01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,860
individually so the Drupal Association

01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:59,930
is doing some of our work entirely

01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:02,540
independently we want to do some more

01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:05,120
work together as well there's work that

01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,980
the core maintainer team can do to talk

01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,750
about how we choose no more new core

01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,940
maintainer x' there's work that any

01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:12,620
individual Drupal business can do to

01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,470
choose to talk about their hiring

01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,780
practices and training and even how they

01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,730
interact with clients so I just wanted

01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:22,340
to share some of this vulnerability some

01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:25,160
of this empathy and perhaps inspire some

01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:28,210
people out there to do the same I want

01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:31,250
to say thank you to the DNI group or

01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:33,340
helping me in my journey over the last

01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:36,290
year or so I want to say thank you to

01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:37,609
the Drupal Association leadership team

01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:39,109
for some of the really

01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:42,409
internal trainings that they've

01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:44,570
organized for us as staff and I want to

01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:47,869
say thank you to all of you listening

01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:49,939
for taking this to heart taking it

01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:50,959
seriously and perhaps thinking about how

01:28:49,939 --> 01:28:54,019
you can engage with it

01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:57,050
yourself in your own way so thank you

01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:58,969
very much everyone with that we'll get

01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:01,609
back to the slightly less serious stuff

01:28:58,969 --> 01:29:04,309
if you want to have a Drupal con t-shirt

01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:07,429
that will be available on the community

01:29:04,309 --> 01:29:10,489
driven community LED t-shirt store if

01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:13,999
it's important to you to complete your

01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:15,919
collection feel free to pick one up and

01:29:13,999 --> 01:29:17,719
also feel free to participate in the

01:29:15,919 --> 01:29:20,179
group photo that's what we always do at

01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,800
the end of a juries note as we all go

01:29:20,179 --> 01:29:23,659
gather out in the courtyard somewhere

01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:26,539
and take a group photo we're going to do

01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:29,300
a version of that virtually so let's go

01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:31,939
ahead and we can take some selfies of us

01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,769
attending DrupalCon upload them to

01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:35,539
celebrate drupal.org and then tweet them

01:29:33,769 --> 01:29:37,669
out with the hashtag Drupal con photo

01:29:35,539 --> 01:29:40,010
and we'll use that to assemble a mosaic

01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:43,249
group photo for this virtual DrupalCon

01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:44,959
event so thank you so much again for

01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:46,879
being here thank you so much for your

01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:48,379
attention I hope you're as excited as I

01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:50,539
am about the initiatives that Teresa's

01:29:48,379 --> 01:29:52,510
outlined and and about the ways that we

01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:54,859
can evolve and improve our community

01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:56,419
have a great one take a look at your

01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:58,699
schedules get ready for your next event

01:29:56,419 --> 01:30:00,919
you should have a little bit of time to

01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:03,550
get rolling and thank you again everyone

01:30:00,919 --> 01:30:03,550
