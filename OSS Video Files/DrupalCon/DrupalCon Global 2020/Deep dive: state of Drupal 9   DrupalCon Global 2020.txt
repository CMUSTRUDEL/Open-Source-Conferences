all right well should we get started yep

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
okay

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,599
uh welcome everyone this is deep dive

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
state of drupal 9.

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,400
these slides are open sourced and

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480

and special thanks to these people

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,920
listed here

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
for improvement suggestions and feedback

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
this session

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
is heavy on practical tools

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
documentation policy

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,800
and other information and it would be

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
impossible to put all the links on the

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
slides and allow enough time

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
for people to pencil them down so use

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
this link to review the slides with

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,680
speaker notes

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,360
we have a special version of this talk

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,760
for drupalcon

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,719
and i've pasted the link to these slides

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,480
in the chat

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
i'll do that one more time here

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
so you can follow along with that deck

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,320
yeah there's a link to the

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
there's a link to the uh the slides that

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,040
are

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
not branched for drupalcon and that's on

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,840
the screen for people who want to

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,920
present this at their events

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,280
exactly we'll be taking questions at the

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,439
end of the presentation

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
in the chat if you have a question

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,400
prefix your question with

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,360
q colon and we'll do our best to get to

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,080
as many questions as we can

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
my name is amber matz i work at ocl labs

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
on drupalized

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,040
me i'm a co-maintainer of the

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,600
experimental core module help

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,000
topics and you can contact me on the

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,439
interwebs at amber heims mats

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,640
you i'm gabriel hoichi uh from hungary

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,520
i work at akuya forever basically i'm an

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,079
initiative coordinator for drupal 9

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
and generally an initiative coordinator

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,240
coordinator

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,479
for drupal core that's a title that that

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,560
most events fix on my badge because it

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
must be a typo but i'm actually trying

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,119
to help coordinators

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,399
uh be effective uh been a dribble core

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,640
contributor

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,800
forever as well and core committers you

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
can find me on twitter at gabor hoichi

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
so uh the first question this is a deep

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
dive drupal 9 but we can't ignore the

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,400
elephant in the room

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,720
so who is i don't know who of you

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
are using drupal 7 but i would assume

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
that

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
a significant amount of you are using

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
drupal 7 because if you look at the

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,280
usage stats for drupal.org

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,440
more than 60 of drupal users uh may be

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,440
using drupal 7 at this time so it's a

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
significant part of drupal's user base

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
so we

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
we can't ignore that question the

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,599
problem

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,080
with drupal 7 or moving from drupal 7

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,280
is when we built drupal 8 how we did

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,920
drupal 8 is we basically took drupal 7

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
we created a branch and then we went

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
happy and changed

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,200
whatever we wanted and we wanted to make

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
it object oriented we wanted to use new

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
technologies we wanted to introduce new

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
features

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
and it was a happy time for a while

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
and then we realized that a bunch of

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
things we started refactoring are not

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
yet done

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
and we still need to polish those up and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,120
then we

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
still wanted to do some more things and

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
that just piled up and it took a long

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,319
time to

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
even release triple h and that was a

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,480
problem

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,519
for a lot of people because the because

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
uh the rebuild uh the rebuild of core

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
from drupal

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
7 to aaa took a long time so if you put

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
something in core

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
it took a long time for it to be

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,239
released it was also a problem for

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
users of drupal because moving off from

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,760
drupal 7 is

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,680
hard um it was also a problem for

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
contributed project maintainers

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
because they need to learn all of these

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
news ap new apis

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
so it seemed to be a good idea to try to

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
um

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
try to refactor and rebuild as much as

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
we can

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
but we found that being a challenge at

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
the on the other hand

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,799
we got a lot of value from doing that

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,400
because a lot of those refactorings

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,000
allowed us to do great features like um

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,560
like um big pipe

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,400
uh thanks to the very very fine grain

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
caching information that we have

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,479
and that wouldn't be possible in the

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
drupal 7 architecture that we've had

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,080
so there are some benefits to what we

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
did but we also learned from this

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
process that was bad for our core

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,560
contributors but for users and bad for

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,720
country maintainers alike

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
what if you are on drupal 7 though what

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
you are facing right now

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
is a rebuild we can call it an upgrade

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,160
we can go with something else

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
probably rebuild is the best term that

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
we can use

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
you would use the drupal 7 version of

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
upgrade status which is going to tell

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840
you if your drupal 7 versions of your

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,520
modules are available for drupal 8.

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,080
we have an issue to make that module

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
also display if your drupal 8 module is

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,639
also compatible with drupal 9

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,039
that's not yet done but we hope to do

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
that

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,759
soon and then your drupal 7 upgrade

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
status module would tell you

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
if your update to drupal 8 is also

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
drupal 9 compatible

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
there is the drupal module upgrader

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
project

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,639
that helps you convert your custom code

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,000
from drupal 7 to drupal 8

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,479
9 and it will not do a perfect

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
job but it will do uh a best effort on

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,080
like hook menu hoop block and a bunch of

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
other very common things so

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,320
you get a big head start and then

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,720
there's the migrate suite in core

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,800
and income trip that allows you to take

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
your data on your content and some of

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,560
your configuration

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,160
and migrate it over to drupal 8 or 9.

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
there are some improvements to these

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
tools with drupal 9 or alongside

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
building drupal 9

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,320
so one of the things that we made sure

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,199
is that the drupal module upgrader

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
generates code that is drupal 8 and 9

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
compatible

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,560
at once and this is a whole new

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,919
paradigm with drupal 9 and drupal some

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
versions of drupal 8

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,919
that you can have code that is both

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,680
compatible with drupal 8 and drupal 9 at

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,680
once we'll talk about more of that later

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
on in the presentation

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
uh and the other thing that's sort of

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
new with drupal 9 and 8.9

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
is that the migrate multilingual core

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
module is now stable

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
so there's no part of the migrate module

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
suite

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
in core that is experimental anymore all

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039
the parts

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,520
in core are stable so you can use that

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
to

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800
migrate to drupal 8 or 9. um the best

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,199
improvements in eight nine and nine for

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,039
this

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,120
are uh the migrations of revisionable

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
translated content

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
they're they're perfectly merged

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
together in the right

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
revisions and everything for drupal 8 9

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
or 9 it's

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,720
really great so in terms of the timeline

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
what you're looking at

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
is we've recently extended the drupal 7

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
end of life

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,039
so now the drupal 7 security and bug

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,000
fixed support goes all the way to

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,400
2022 november there is going to be bug

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
fixed releases of drupal 7 alongside the

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
same

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
timeline that drupal 9 release is going

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,319
to be released

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,599
so twice a year um if

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,759
you just need the content of your

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,599
website to be uh up but not the

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,400
interactive parts then lulabot

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,360
actually has a great article series on

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,039
how to go

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
how to make your drupal 7 website a

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,120
static website

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,039
so go check them out uh and starting

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
november 2022

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,120
if uh you still need more support for

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
your drupal 7 side there's vendor

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,599
extended commercial support for drupal

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,039
7.

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,039
there's a bunch of vendors that are

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,080
providing contract based

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,319
support for your drupal 7 sites keep in

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
mind that the contributed module space

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,160
will not be that

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
good supported anymore the php versions

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
will go end of live so there's going to

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,919
be

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
a bunch of challenges some of which the

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
vendors will support

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,960
some of which they will have a hard time

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,160
supporting but they will do

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,560
as as best as they can and the

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
confines of your contract um to support

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
your drupal 7 sites

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,039
and that goes all the way to the around

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,759
the end of 2025 so drupal 7

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,080
is still going to have a long life ahead

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
of it

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
now instead of creating a whole new

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
branch when we started working on the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
new version

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
we built drupal 9 almost entirely in

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
drupal 8.

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,959
we'll also continue working on drupal 10

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,640
in drupal 9

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,959
and so on so adopting drupal 8 or 9

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
now means you get in on this new

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,479
innovation scheme

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
where the updates are much easier to

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
adopt

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,880
but what does building drupal 9 and 8

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
mean

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,320
exactly first we adopted three key

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
mechanisms to allow for innovation in

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
dribble 8.

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,800
first semantic versioning

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,839
it allows us to separate new feature

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,200
releases

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
minor versions from bug fixes or patch

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,720
versions

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,240
this way we could release 8.1.x 8.2.x

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,480
etc with new features and api editions

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,600
while keeping backwards compatibility

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,600
as much as possible this allowed us to

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,800
add a media library

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,760
layout builder bigpipe json api

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,920
settings tray and so on in drupal 8. it

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
also allowed us to add new apis to

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,680
drupal 8.

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,839
second scheduled releases every 6 months

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,959
allowed us to push out improvements to

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
user sites

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
much faster than before we received

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
feedback

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
sooner so we could adjust direction this

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,200
also provided

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,760
a lot more incentives to contribute

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
and finally experimental modules and

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
themes

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,519
allowed us to release unfinished

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,399
improvements where we needed more

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
feedback

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
we learned that we needed to provide

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
backwards compatibility for these and

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
adjusted

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,600
our process as we went see drupal.org

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,440
core slash experimental for more

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
information about experimental projects

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
so if we can do all of that stuff right

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,240
we can release new features

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,880
uh we do them twice a year we don't need

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
to wait

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,640
when everybody when it's ready it's not

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
coming out in four years or five years

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
so whatever you are investing

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
if it's done it's in core it's going to

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
be released twice a year

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,480
why why did we need drupal 9 at all then

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,920
so why could we just not continue on

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
what we did in

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,959
drupal 8. unfortunately that was not

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,600
possible to continue that

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
because there is a great thing with

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
drupal 8 that we have a bunch of

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,760
external dependencies

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,519
because we don't need to build our own

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
some of our own front-end layers our own

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
visibility editor

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,480
our own um interactive front-end

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
components

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
our own http layer etc so we don't need

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,640
to build those things for ourselves

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,640
we don't need to maintain them we need

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
to make them secure and make sure that

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
they're absolutely secure every time

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
we rely on some of these third-party

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,600
components to do that for us

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,839
and we work with them um so to

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
to make make it make it uh mutually

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,680
beneficial

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
but it also means that whatever really

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
we rely on

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,240
we need to take care of when what their

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,160
release schedules are

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
which versions are they're supporting

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,440
and sometimes they make backwards

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,240
compatible backwards incompatible

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
changes

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
we need to need to adapt and in that

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
case we need to release

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,519
a new version of drupal core because aaa

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,040
we made a promise

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
it's going to be backwards compatible

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
whenever a new release comes out

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
new older contributed projects and

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,519
custom code

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
would be backwards compatible so each of

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,600
these have their own situation

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,760
uh we were using symphony 3.4 in php 8

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
and that goes end of life november next

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
year

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,000
and there was a bunch of other

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
dependencies where we need to consider

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
the end of life but symphony was the

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
main

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
driver behind the end of life of drupal

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
8 so here

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,880
the symphony 3 end of life is november

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
next year

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
so we defined drupal 8 security and bug

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
fix support to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
end there our only alternative would

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,920
have been to basically

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,880
force symphony 3 or to get into

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,240
to get them to support it longer but you

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,440
know they are not drupal

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,720
we can really make them do stuff that we

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,839
that we wouldn't do so that's where

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,399
that's why we decided that we need to uh

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
and drupal 8 support there and then the

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
next question was how long do we need to

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,240
give people to update to the new version

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
and we wanted to have at least 12 months

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,320
but we ended up providing even more

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,920
as we released drupal 9 on june 3rd 2020

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
a little while ago

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,560
so what we do here is we go on with the

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
new feature releases of drupal 9 from

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,720
there on

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,800
and we keep supporting drupal 8.9 until

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
the end of next year

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
and then drupal 8 support stops and

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,360
there's not going to be any extended

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,680
support

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
because we are not going to support a

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,120
symphony a fork of symphony 3

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,040
for drupal 8. there's some crystal

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,160
balling coming up here

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
but you know there's symphony 4 end of

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
life is coming up

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,399
uh 2023 uh q4

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
and as dries said that's likely when we

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,560
need to end drupal 9 security and

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,120
backfix support for the same reasons

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,360
and also ck editor support ends around

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,600
that time so that's the secret to 4

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
support ends around that time so it also

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
factors into that

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,199
so what we plan to do is to release

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
drupal 10

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,920
uh hopefully uh similar to drupal 9 in

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
the year and a half before

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,399
we need to stop supporting drupal 9. so

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,880
the drupal 10 is target currently at

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,959
q2 and then we're going to continue

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,199
releasing drupal 10 onwards

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,079
and then drupal 10 security and backflip

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,240
support will

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
continue from there onwards so i don't

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,279
know if you've noticed but drupal

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,240
7 um

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,279
community support goes on all the way

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,560
longer

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,760
than drupal 8 community support goes

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
and so people will some and even after

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,199
drupal 10 is released in the plan

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,839
so there's going to be some people who

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,440
will migrate from drupal 7 to drupal 10

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,040
directly

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,920
so that's kind of uh hard to hard to

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,680
grasp i think that we just released

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,760
drupal 9 now

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
and now we are talking about drupal 10

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
and how long drupal 10 is going to be

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
supported

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,399
and um historically that would be

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,920
like very dangerous to talk about

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,880
because you know based on the pain that

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
we've talked about

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,199
from getting getting out of triple seven

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,480
but we learned a lot from that pain

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,959
and we made a lot of improvements and i

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,360
hope

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,000
that we proved a lot with the drupal 9's

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,560
release and

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
how the contrib system was supporting uh

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,199
dating to drupal 9.

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,560
and if we prove this well then i hope

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
that you will believe us that we can

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,920
make the triple 10 transition even

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,040
easier

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,720
so the transition from drupal 8 to 9 to

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
10 is more like going

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,320
uh through these checkpoints instead of

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
moving onto a whole different branch and

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
doing this

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,120
happy refactoring and the thing that

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,440
allowed us to do that is

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
our deprecation processes so what we do

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,279
there

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,199
is we basically pre-announce in core

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,720
what are we going to change

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,480
and then we make those changes with the

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
new major release so we tell you what

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,839
the changes are going to be

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
we add all the new things and then we

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,320
just make the changes we already told

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
you we're gonna make

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,480
so there's no surprises there and

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
modules and users can prepare how that

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
preparation looks like

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,399
looks like this so let's see we have the

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
eight seven api

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,480
we deprecate something we'd say that

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
we're going to remove this in drupal 9.

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
we put in a new solution for this that's

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
better it's a nicer api

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,880
something like that and we go on on this

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
path and we did eight nine had the more

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,279
more deprecated things and more no

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,199
new solutions but basically we've had

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
all of the new things from drupal 9

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,720
already

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,320
put into drupal 8. so as you updated the

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
drupal 8 versions you got all the new

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
things from drupal 9

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,040
and you also still get all the things

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
from aaa that we're going to remove in

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,839
drupal 9 and what we do in drupal 9 is

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
basically we

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
execute on what we told you we're going

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
to do so with that we remove the things

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
we told you we're going to remove

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
and we update our third party

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,480
dependencies so basically

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,639
in other words drupal 9 as drupal 8 9

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,880
minus our api uh our the drupal 9 api

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,639
minus the deprecated parts and we update

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
the third-party dependencies

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,880
so this makes the new major version much

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
more predictable than before

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
because they put in all the new things

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,120
in the previous version

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
and just do the updates we promised and

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
in other words

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
aaa code not using deprecated apis will

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
continue to work and does actually

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,799
currently work

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,839
on drupal 9. so um

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
so that's how you can have a project

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,039
that works

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,959
both on drupal 8 and drupal 9 is you

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,839
just don't use the boxes and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
just just use the apis that are gray

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,959
boxes here

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,280
you just use the other things and then

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,919
you would be fine

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,319
so if you want to try out drupal 9 now

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,919
then this is and you have composer

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,600
installed locally which is the best

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,400
practice now and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,679
drupal 9 actually also best practice

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
with drupal 8.

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,919
you can go and try this out so this is

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,640
probably the least characters to try out

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,720
drupal 9

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
if you have composer and you have a

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
local environment with

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,039
php on the command line and this gets

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,640
you a browser it has a server sqli

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,480
database etc so you don't need to have

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,520
an external web server or database or

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,039
anything running

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
it gets you a drupal nine

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
so i know what you're thinking okay i

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,000
can install drupal 9 with two commands

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
that's great but i have existing drupal

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160
8 sites

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,000
how do i upgrade to drupal 9 then

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,640
the first step you need to look at is

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,799
whether your environment is compatible

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,559
php requirements and database

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,120
requirements were raised

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,919
dresh only supports drupal 9 with drush

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,679
10.

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,600
while these are the main requirements

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,400
this list is not

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,160
altogether conclusive if you're using

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,080
mariadb 10.3.7

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,440
is required if you're using sqlite 3.26

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,320
required and if you're using postgresql

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,840
10.x is required with the pg underscore

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,720
trgm extension for example

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,520
second you should keep drupal core up to

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
date

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
all the new features and apis of drupal

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,000
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,400
have been added to drupal 8. so by

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,640
adopting the latest drupal 8 version

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,039
you're adopting drupal 9's features and

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,679
apis

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,480
it's also important to note that only

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,640
upgrades

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,440
from drupal 8.8 and 8.9 will be

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,720
supported

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
when moving to drupal 9. this is to make

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,480
sure problems

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,000
updating to drupal 9 are limited to

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,039
actual problems with this

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
upgrade path and not intertwined with

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,880
possible drupal 8

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,120
core update issues also drupal 8.7

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
went unsupported when drupal 9 was

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,799
released

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,640
so fixing upgrade path issues is not

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,960
possible from there anymore

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
the best way to prepare for your drupal

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,600
9 upgrade

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:43,039
is to move to at least drupal 8.8

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,919
now the third step

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,440
is to update contributed projects to

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
their latest versions

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,360
they these are gradually adopting the

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
new apis and a lot of work has already

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
been done on that

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,799
and removing uses of the deprecated apis

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,600
so that by using the latest versions you

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,520
are getting gradually ready for drupal 9

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,960
while while you still have a fully

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,520
working drupal 8 site

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,440
so for example modules are getting ready

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,039
and have been getting ready for drupal 9

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,080
in various ways

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,600
token has its 8.x

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,799
1.7 release that is both drupal 8

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,240
and drupal 9 compatible web form

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,200
released a 6.0.0 version that is both

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
drupal 8 and drupal 9 compatible but how

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,120
is this possible

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,520
and what is this 6.0.0 versioning

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,559
so above token module said that their

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,679
1.7 version is drupal 9 compatible

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,360
but the version number is 8.x

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,159
dash 1.7 we learned that it is drupal 9

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,440
compatible

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:56,640
from the project page internally

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,880
the module declared in its info.yml file

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
using this core underscore version

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
underscore requirement key

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,960
that it's which is this composer

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,039
compatible version rule

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
and this allows you as a module

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,320
maintainer to add multiple

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,880
core compatibility information in this

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,440
case the info file in token

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:23,280
8.x 1.7 says it's compatible with both

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,559
drupal 8.8 and as well as 9.

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,200
so the 8.x prefix prefix

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,400
looks very odd at this point and that's

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,440
true so stay tuned so hold on a minute

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,520
let's also talk about web form which has

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,760
which had this 6.0.0 alpha 2 available

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
that's since increased since these

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,760
screenshots were made but let's use that

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,080
as an example

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,760
this 6 here this doesn't refer to a

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,880
drupal 6 module

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,919
that would be 6 dot x

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,000
y dot z but it's rather using this

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,640
newly available semantic versioning

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,720
system for contributed projects

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,880
more and more project versions are

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,080
adopting the full

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,559
major.minor.patch scheme

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,720
instead of having the core compatibility

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,679
built into their version number

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,360
and using only two components the core

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,200
compatibility version number

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,720
is not encoded in this version because

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,080
with multi-core compatibility like 8.8

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,200
and 9 it would be impossible to do so

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,840
also 8.x as a

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,799
number a version number was already not

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,640
correct

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,520
in terms of semantic versioning for

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,720
projects which required 8.3.0

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720
and above for example due to a new api

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,640
so when will contributed projects be

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,000
ready for drupal 9

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,600
as of june 12th 2020 looking at

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,400
the top 200 projects 87 of them are

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,760
explicitly drupal 9 compatible

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,080
of the 9081 total projects

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,840
2 674 of them are explicitly compatible

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,600
while 2834 of them would only need an

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,480
info file change altogether 60

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,640
is either explicitly compatible or only

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,400
needs this

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,880
info.yml file change

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,240
an interactive browser of contributed

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
project status is available on

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,919
dev.aquia.com

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,919
drupal 9 deprecation underscore status

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,000
the next step is to remove all

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
deprecated api

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,360
use in your custom projects and mark

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,440
them as drupal 9 compatible as well

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
we'll cover some tools to do this in a

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,279
moment

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,360
at this point in the process you have an

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
environment that runs the latest drupal

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,480
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,880
up-to-date contributed projects and

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
drupal 9 compatible custom modules and

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,000
themes

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,360
and your drupal 8 site is still

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,080
operational as it is

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,360
so basically you are all prepared for

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,520
dribble 9 at this point

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,400
but your drupal 8 site is still

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
perfectly running

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
the final step is that you update core

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,279
itself

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,559
to drupal 9. since you ensured in the

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,320
previous steps

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,919
that your components are all drupal 9

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
compatible as well

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,559
theoretically you would not run into any

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
problems

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,600
to recap all of these steps you would do

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,159
these first four steps on your drupal 8

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,880
site and you verify that the site still

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,760
works

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,480
you only update to drupal 9 itself in

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
the last step

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
all right let's look at the upgrade

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,080
tools i see in the meantime that josh

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
miller in the chat is saying that he

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
should up

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,880
he should fix drupal 9 compatibility

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,039
with one of their drupal 8 projects

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,840
during this presentation yes please feel

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,520
free

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,919
um uh you may find the patch in the

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,880
project already either from the drupal

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
uh project upgrade bot or from uh from a

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
helpful contributor

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,080
um updating your project to drupal 9

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,760
compatibility there's a very good chance

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
that you only need to fix an info file

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,640
because a third of the projects only

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,120
need to fix that

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,960
so let's see what are the tools that you

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,039
can use to do this

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,480
so let's dive into these tools so first

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
how do you know

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,679
what is deprecated if you look at the

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
code

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,080
this is how you know so let's see drupal

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,120
set message is the most popular thing

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,120
uh that is deprecated um it has an at a

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,279
deprecated annotation in the code that

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,360
says this is deprecated in

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,760
aaa five and it's going to be remove the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,320
nine and it tells you what to do instead

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
and there's a trigger error which fires

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,679
in case

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
this function is invoked and error

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,039
collection

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
is uh configured to collect these type

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,200
of errors

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,600
and it tells you basically the same

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
thing and points you at a url or where

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,279
to learn more

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,159
so this is how we know from the code and

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,760
what we do there

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,919
is we keep a backwards compatible

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
implementation of this code

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,919
so this still works on drupal 8 it's

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,679
deprecated it says it's going to be

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,799
removed but it still works the same way

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,440
it did before

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,000
it just tells you what to do instead um

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
so that's

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,679
why we we have this backwards

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,159
compatibility promise but we also tell

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,520
you this is going to change

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,159
a way to find uh what uses drupal set

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,840
message

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,840
or the best way to find it is the

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,880
upgrade status module

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,960
um this provides a very fancy dashboard

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,320
that tells you about your site status it

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,559
tells you whether your

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,679
web server is compatible with your php

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,480
is compatible

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,080
if you are using drush if that is

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,440
compatible or not

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,159
um um trusses brush is not a requirement

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,080
for uh for drupal 9 but if you if it

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,279
the text that you're using russian tells

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,039
you about that too

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,120
and then checks your custom code in your

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,919
contributed code and it finds all of

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,799
these uses of deprecated apis

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,400
there is a rush integration for upgrade

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,520
status as well so you can use it from

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,520
the command line there is the drupal

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,320
check tool uh which provides a subset of

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,640
the features of

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,520
upgrade status so upgrade status builds

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
on top of what

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,159
what's in drupal check and provides a

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
lot more features for checking twig api

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,640
applications javascript

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,159
uh or library deprecation story info

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,760
yaml files and a bunch of other things

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
that drupal check will not

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,240
check so if you've been using drupal

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,760
check it's a good time to switch over to

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,279
upgrade status either

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,960
on the command line or the user

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,960
interface so

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,880
that's going to find you the problems

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,039
but you still need to fix it

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,960
and that's where upgrade director or the

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,399
drupal rector project comes in

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,919
so drupal rector is a plugin for the

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,840
rector project

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,600
and then it's going to fix you a bunch

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,880
of things automatically

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,559
it currently fixes about 42 of all of

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,440
the drupal.org

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,000
contributed project problems so it's

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,919
going to fix

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
almost half of the problems so it's

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,039
likely that it's going to do the same

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,039
for you

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,480
and the upgrade directory is just a ui

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,120
module that

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
gives you a patch in the text box if you

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
need to post a patch somewhere

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,159
or just review it but you can use it

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,200
from the command line

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,159
with rector itself and so what we are

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
doing

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,159
on drupal.org actually is there is a

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,200
project upgrade bot

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,039
that runs this tool uh drupal rector on

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,120
all of the contributed projects

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
and if it finds that it can fix issues

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,520
then it posts a patch to the project

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,960
and to an issue and then project

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
maintainers can just take the patch and

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,399
commit it and

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,880
a lot of times they just can take that

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,880
and make the project drupal 9 compatible

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,880
right away there's a lot of projects

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
that have these patches waiting so

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,159
if you have a project in dribble.org and

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,200
you haven't looked at your issue queue

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,799
recently

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,399
it would be nice to maybe take

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,919
tomorrow's contribution day and look at

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,600
your issue queue and see if you have a

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,279
patch waiting from the project upgrade

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,200
bot

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,440
the best way to test if it actually

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
works then once you fix your problems is

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
to run your automated tests against

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,480
drupal 9.

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,559
unfortunately not everybody has full

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,159
automated test coverage that would be a

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,840
very ideal scenario but that's

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,080
unfortunately not always

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,080
possible so if you don't have tests or

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,799
not enough coverage of tests

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,880
the and you have a drupal.org project

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,399
then you can use this drupal ciemo

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
snippet to

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,440
use with your project and it's going to

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
give you

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,000
an analysis of your project and give you

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,679
an error list specific for your project

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
you can use this in patches and then get

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,159
the results from what your patch

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,919
did but if you don't want to go there

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,039
there's this centralized source of

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,919
information at depth.com9

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,919
that takes data from drupal.org which is

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,360
running this script weekly on all of

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,880
contrib

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,039
and uh gives a very raw set of data that

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
we take every week and parse out to this

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,720
interactive form that you can search for

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
project and see their drupal 9

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,559
compatibility look at graphs of trends

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,159
etc you may notice that the data from

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,000
last week he's not yet available

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,000
unfortunately there was some glitches

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,480
with uh the

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,279
the scripts running there with how it

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,279
runs the

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,960
the system installs etc and we don't

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,399
this week we're at drupalcon so we don't

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
have the time to debug the

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,760
debug the scripts but the data is

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,159
available from the week before

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,360
uh so you can look at that data now it's

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,360
not that old so

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,640
you can go there and see what the

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,200
general status of

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,399
contributed projects are so that those

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,399
are the tools that you can use

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,559
so we said that there are no new

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,679
features in drupal 9.0.0 compared to

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,720
drupal 8

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,279
and that's true drupal 9.1

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
and onwards we'll continue introducing

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,399
new features

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,600
and go on to stabilize existing

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,600
experimental projects

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,480
the easy upgrade path is the great new

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,039
feature of drupal 9.0

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
this is what we always wanted dries did

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,120
a great job talking about the shiny

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,159
awesome new features of drupal 8

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,399
and now 9 in the dressnote if you missed

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,880
it

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,760
check the reception tab for info on how

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,399
to access the on-demand video content

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,159
and what the daily password is last i

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,000
checked the dress note was uploaded

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,000
there and it was on the last page

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,760
so new features will be released twice a

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
year

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,399
like they were for drupal 8 and so the

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,240
next one is on december 2nd

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,240
2020 right therese at

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
the whole drinks note was about what

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,159
what new

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,399
we are planning to do and new 9 releases

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,120
so we're not going to cover it here

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,519
i think amber is looking forward to work

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,519
on

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,320
help topics tomorrow at the contribution

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,279
day is one of the new things that we

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,600
want to stabilize in drupal core and

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,360
there's also a drupal 10 table tomorrow

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,760
contribution day if you want to get

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,120
involved with that

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,240
so in summary drupal 7

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,080
to 8 or 9 is the last big step

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,440
it is a big step we've been working on

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,080
making that better

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,519
with the migration tool stabilizing and

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,320
we are providing our

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,240
vendors are providing extended support

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,919
until the end of 2025

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:33,360
if you um if you need that extension

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,919
uh drupal 8-9 though is the easiest

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,720
upgrade

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,480
in a decade so we learned a lot from

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,559
what we did from seven to eight

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,000
and we don't want to repeat that again

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,880
so we made drupal

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,640
829 way easier we built all of these

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,200
tools we built all of these automations

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,559
to enable the contributed projects to

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,559
to uh upgrade um uh

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,799
palantir did an amazing job on the

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,519
drupal rector tools to make them

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
make them have this extensive coverage

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,039
so

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,000
we could keep using that for drupal 9-10

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,640
onwards

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
so the way to prepare for drupal 9 is to

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
keep up with

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,640
aaa core and contributed projects so

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,159
just keep looking at how the drupal 8

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,039
contributed projects that you're using

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,080
get ready

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,919
for drupal 9 if not already

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,240
you should remove your own deprecated

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,880
api use with the tools provided

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,720
i really suggest that you start using

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,080
drupal rector because it's going to fix

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
almost half of the problems

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,399
statistically so

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,480
it's going to give you a whole big jump

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,279
in terms of your compatibility without

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,880
a lot of manual hassle and when all

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,320
components are ready you upgrade to

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,039
drupal 9.

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,600
and before that you still have a fully

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,360
up-to-date drupal 8 site that has

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,799
uh your contributed project that's

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,760
running it's taking

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,600
um taking your taking your traffic etc

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,559
so you don't need to work on a silo

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
elsewhere

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
you just maintain your drupal 8 site and

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,360
keep it up to date and

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,519
on the way you just basically get ready

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,080
for drupal 9. i think that's

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,039
uh a great processing proven that we

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,000
learned from

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,359
drupal 7. so the key thing here is that

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,919
you are getting ready

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,359
in your drupal 8 site and not in a

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,200
separate environment

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,960
and then drupal 9 onwards will continue

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,280
to get exciting new features so

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,359
there was not much exciting new and

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,560
drupal 9.0 other than

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,679
the easy upgrade path but new features

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,720
are coming uh if you'd like to read more

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,839
and discuss the drupal 9 landing page

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,879
that lists out

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,960
the general areas of uh key things about

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,440
drupal 9 is that drupal.org

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,159
nine the status of contributed projects

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,159
again is at dev.akki.com9

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,000

questions because this is

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,040
usually very helpful and we'll look at

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,520

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,520
so somebody asked how to how to see the

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,960
dress note yes

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,000
um the drupal association posted that on

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
vimeo

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,839
if you go back to the not now but after

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,440
this session you go back to the

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,200
reception tab

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
there's information on how to get to

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,079
vimeo what's the current password of the

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
day

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,599
and you can go there and check out the

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,640
dress note and see what's coming up in

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,320
future versions

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,160
of drupal 9.

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,839
so we have a question if i want to

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,400
upgrade my site from

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,240
d8 to d9 and there's a contrib module

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,160
not prepared for d9 yet

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,720
that's a blocker right what do you

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,520
recommend in this case

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,160
want to take that remember well i i

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,920
would say

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,680
um open an issue in that in that modules

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,440
uh issue issue queue and uh

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,839
it and let them know that you're

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,680
interested in a drupal 9 version

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:44,320
um it and they have tools

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,280
available to to check their their module

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,760
to see what

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,440
needs to be updated there in some cases

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
it might just be an info file

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
if they've already been keeping up and

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,280
removing the deprecated apis and using

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,880
the new apis

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,800
they might be ready to go and they just

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,119
need an info file

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,720
and if you know how to do that or you're

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,160
running the tools on their behalf maybe

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,000
you can provide a patch

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,359
to update their their info files so

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,359
depending on your

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,400
comfort level with module development

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,480
you might be able to just

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,079
help them out provide a patch and the

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,839
module can be compatible but definitely

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,400
let them know you're interested

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,760
in in an updated version try and help

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,000
them as much as you can

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,280
uh you know recruit help from others if

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,359
if the module

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,880
you know maintainer is busy right now or

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,480
has other things going on

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,960
see what you can do to support them to

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
help them get to a drupal 9 compatible

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,400
version

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,680
yeah you can offer to help maintain it

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,520
if the project is

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,280
is abandoned or it looks like it's

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,800
abandoned there's a bunch of activity in

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
the issue queue but the maintainers

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,040
aren't

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
i don't have time anymore for the

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,119
project and there's also an

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,560
abandoned project process hundred bullet

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,280
org that you

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,800
search for abandoned projects drupal

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,079
drupal abandoned projects or something

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,240
you find the process

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,119
and it describes what to do in that case

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,839
uh

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,839
to uh try to get a hold of

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
maintainership

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,960
let's see is the slack channel the right

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,359
place to ask if you aren't sure how to

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,480
fix

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,920
a required change so

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:20,320
maybe like the the d9 readiness channel

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,800
um or what what other channels

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,920
like beside is the d9 readiness channel

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,320
the best

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,000
place to get help with getting your job

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,640
is the best yes eventually i think that

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,760
things will just move over to contribute

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,520
because it's going to be the version

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,800
maybe it's not going to be its own

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,960
channel but yes

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,040
so there is a question from shane uh

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,680
just for clarification do you have to

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,560
upgrade from drupal 7 to drupal 8

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,400
and then to drupal 9 or can you upgrade

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,200
straight to drupal 9

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
um you don't need to upgrade from seven

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,119
to eight

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,319
you can skip it entirely and migrate

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,480
or rebuild from drupal 7 to drupal 9

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,359
you don't need to go into drupal 8 in

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,119
between

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,800
um there's no reason to do that anymore

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,000
uh if you

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,160
yeah yeah i think if you if you have

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,680
contributed projects that are not

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,920
eight compatible they're not gonna be

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,280
non-compatible either so it's it's not

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,400
going to make a difference in that

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,480
decision

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,839
um so you would work with the

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,400
maintainers to make that

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,920
uh make that project available for eight

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,640
and nine

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,280
um but yeah then you just go direct to

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,480
nine

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,920
we have actually drupal 9.0

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:48,079
includes a migration path from drupal 7

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,319
and drupal 6. so all the way

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,599
to the end of drupal 9 security and bug

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,160
fix support to drupal to

00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:59,359
2023 we will have in-core

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,119
migration support from drupal 6

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,640
to direct to drupal 9. so that's kind of

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,590
that's the other thing that we could put

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,800
up a slide like this

00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,800
[Music]

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,240
so another question what about contrib

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,400
projects that

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,880
are not necessarily abandoned but the

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
maintainer just declines to upgrade

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,359
due to some undisclosed reason or

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,480
personal reason

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,520
um so what do you do there

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,200
um what would your advice be

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,839
if if you have a module that you're

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,280
relying on um i'll put in my two cents

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,280
and then gabor you can

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,000
also ask um see what the

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,359
the uh the module is doing what's the

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the function of it is there another

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,240
module

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,599
that duplicates the functionality is

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,480
this something that you can do in a

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,400
custom module

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,520
you can als if you don't want to go

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,079
through the trouble of

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,880
of you know creating a new project with

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,960
the

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
with the um you know this is an open

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,599
source project so you can also create a

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,119
new project

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,960
so you could accomplish it in a couple

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,000
of different ways if you're

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,800
pressed for time probably a

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,920
a custom custom module with the

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
compatibility

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,240
built in might be the way to go um

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,640
otherwise respectfully um

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
communicating in the issue queue about

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,720
about that

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,680
it would also be a good path to take

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,560
yeah often the same episode drupal 8 has

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,400
a lot more

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,800
granular building blocks that you can

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
use and often the same module would not

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,760
necessarily even make sense

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,160
in aaa 9 so you may just

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,839
use some other system of drupal or you

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,800
build on top of views that's already in

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,319
core instead of having this custom thing

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,839
there's a lot of these building blocks

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,200
in core now

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,680
that you can use um

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,119
there was a question about composer is

00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
it possible to upgrade drupal 8 to

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,240
drupal 9 without

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,200
composer i think yes so you don't

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
is composer is not a hard set

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,440
requirement

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,119
of using drupal i think it's a i think

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,119
it's more and more of a best practice

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
now i think we looked at

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,680
we looked at some statistics data in

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640
terms of contributed projects

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,560
and we've had um had somebody look at

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,839
the checkout of all contributed projects

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,119
of drupal 8

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,560
and around every ten module so

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,839
one in ten projects had some external

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,880
composer dependency

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,680
in their composer.json file uh so

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,720
if so statistics statistically if you

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
use more than ten

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,160
contributed projects on your drupal site

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
on average

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,079
you would encounter a project that has

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,520
an external composer dependency

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,040
and some of these projects have

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,800
workarounds that tell you how to

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
manually download the dependency and put

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,480
it in some directory

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,800
but it will become harder and harder to

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,560
try to maintain that manually and

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,319
do this in every update when a new

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,200
project version comes out and then look

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,880
at what a

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,319
new version of the dependency needs and

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,880
do it manually

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,200
so it becomes more and more of an issue

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,560
to do that so i would suggest to

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,040
look at um look at composer

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,880
i know that has its own learning curve

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,520
if you've looked at composer and you

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,599
find it painfully slow

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,520
then composer to are using a lot of

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,400
memory and and getting down your

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,560
computer

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
then composer two is solving those

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,800
problems

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,480
this is going to be much faster and

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,359
using much less memory

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,040
uh it's not yet stable but the the

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,400
current pre-release versions prove that

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,200
it's way better

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,640
than compressor one was the usability

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,240
could use some more improvements for

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,480
sure in composer

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
and the automated updates initiative is

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,240
working on

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,599
solutions to keep your projects updated

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,119
in a compressor

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,200
compatible way for some of these updates

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,839
that are possible to do automatically

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,359
so that would help with the burden of

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,839
using these manual tools

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,839
in case there is an automated update

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
possible

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,359
um that's all the time we have for today

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
i'm sorry we didn't get to all the

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,240
questions

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,160
uh ruth you might want to check out the

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,200
the automated updates project

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,960
um and um and also

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,440
um regarding the the the modules um not

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,119
not updating you can create a patch show

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,319
uh suggest you can create a patch in

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,240
that issue queue

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,760
and then apply the patch this makes the

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,680
solution uh

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,359
accessible to other people to and you

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,839
can use composer patches

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,599
to automatically update that patch when

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,440
you're updating your site so

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,040
that's also a great solution thank you

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,079
all for coming to our session

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,079
please use the the feedback survey to

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,920
let us know uh what you thought of the

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,839
session and enjoy the rest of your

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,760
drupalcon global experience
