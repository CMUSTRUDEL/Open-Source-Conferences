hello everyone

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
welcome to drupalcon global um and to

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,960
the session on how to improve

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
psychological safety in your

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
organization

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
uh i'm george demet i'm the founder and

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,839
ceo of palantir.net we're a

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
full service digital consultancy that

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,279
designs and develops

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,039
solutions for health care higher

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
education and public sector clients

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,400
using drupal and other open source

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,680
technologies

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,720
um just want to check in make sure

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
everyone can hear me okay no technical

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
issues or

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
glitches before i get started if you do

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,920
see anything

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
awesome just let me know all right

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,800
thanks nelson all right

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,680
so let me get started today um

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,600
on a cheery note by telling the story of

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
two disasters

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
um so those of you who are of a stage

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
like myself

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,520
uh the challenger disaster which

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,399
occurred on january 28 1986

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,160
is probably seared on your memory

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
millions of school children across the

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
united states were watching the launch

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
live on television to see ohio school

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
teacher chris mcauliffe become the first

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,080
civilian astronaut

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,799
73 seconds after launch the shuttle

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
exploded

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,479
killing all seven astronauts on board

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,159
so following this disaster president

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
ronald reagan put together a blue ribbon

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
panel of experts including

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
neil armstrong and sally ride to figure

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
out what went wrong and to ensure that

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
similar launch failures didn't occur in

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
the future

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
they determined that the explosion was

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
caused by the failure of the

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,400
o-ring seals used in the joints of the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
solid rocket boosters that were not

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
designed to handle

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
the unusually cold conditions that

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
existed at this launch but what the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,880
report didn't adequately answer was the

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,200
question of

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,799
why the decision was made to launch in

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
such sub-optimal conditions

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,479
so one of the members of the commission

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,240
was physicist richard feynman

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,000
and he published his own independent

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,799
addendum to the commission's official

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,399
report

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
that offered a frank and honest

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
assessment of the management issues that

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,759
led to the decision to launch

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
despite the objections of the contract

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,439
engineers who had designed and built the

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,920
rocket

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
first of all nasa's culture of success

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,200
at all costs suppressed bad news which

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
meant that

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
concerns and problems either didn't make

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
it to nasa management or were overlooked

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,640
by them

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,200
as a result their assessment of launch

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
risk was orders of magnitude lower than

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
that of the engineer

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,319
there was also significant pressure to

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
move forward with the launch because

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,560
nasa had committed to an ambitious

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
launch schedule for the shuttle program

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,879
and the president was going to give a

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,239
state of the union address that night

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,879
so in this case all the rules were

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,400
followed

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,239
they went through the pre-flight

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
checklists and conferences

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,160
all the inputs were weighed and the

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
majority consensus was to move forward

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,879
with the launch

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
with disastrous results

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,720
the second disaster i want to talk about

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
is the one that we're all living through

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,360
right now

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,760
which is a coveted 19 disaster

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
fundamentally natural disaster that

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,800
wasn't caused by humans

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
there are early on that have

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
significantly contributed to the impact

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
that it's had on everyone around the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,680
world

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
the first is a delayed understanding by

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
chinese government authorities that this

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
was in fact

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
a new disease fundamentally different in

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,040
key ways

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
from previous outbreaks like sars or

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
ebola

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
part of the reason it took so long for

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,959
public health authorities around the

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,200
world to understand the unique nature of

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
coveted 19 is that very early on in the

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
pandemic

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,760
medical workers were discouraged from

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
raising the alarm or sharing information

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
with others

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,159
so ophthalmologist lee wen lang who

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
worked at one of the hospitals in wuhan

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
was actually disciplined when he tried

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
to tell others about the outbreak in

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,440
december

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,000
he was eventually reinstated but we

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,840
simply don't know how many other people

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
had early knowledge and didn't share it

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
because they didn't want to get in

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
trouble

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,159
uh lee wenlong actually himself ended up

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,200
dying from kophik 19 in february

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
similarly we know that having despite

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
having evidence

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
despite evidence of the contrary many

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
u.s political figures downplay the risk

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,239
of the virus

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799
and encourage the media to do the same

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,600
uh

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,840
dr rick bright who's the former director

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
of the biomedical advance research and

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,040
development authority

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
says that he was actually removed from

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
his post because he had raised concerns

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
early on and was saying things that

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
administration officials didn't want to

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,360
hear

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
and finally we know that the cdc is

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
actually making changes

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
to public health guidance under pressure

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
from top administration officials

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
they're revising their guidelines for

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
school reopening after the president had

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
tweeted that he didn't like them

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
so our nation's response to this public

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
health emergency is

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
all too often being driven by politics

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
instead of science which is why it's not

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,280
surprising that we're continuing to see

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,880
case numbers accelerating rapidly

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
so eric just want to check in make sure

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,680
that the broadcast quality was fine i

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
saw your comment there

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,199
i can uh i can tell the kids to stop

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
playing video games upstairs if

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
necessary

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,960
so to paraphrase uh

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
software engineering pilot gregory

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
travis um

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
these kinds of disasters occur not

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
because people

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,639
don't follow the rules but because they

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
do follow the rules without questioning

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,479
their underlying assumptions

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
right so if you see that others around

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
you who speak up with questions or

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
concerns

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,320
are suffering professional consequences

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
as a result you're probably going to be

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
more likely to keep your head down and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
avoid rocking the boat

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
and if this mindset is endemic within

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
the organization it means the people in

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
positions of authority are going to be

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,919
acting with

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
inaccurate or incomplete information

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,440
when they make decisions potentially

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,199
resulting in terrible consequences

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
so how does that kind of mindset take

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,800
root within an organization

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
one answer comes from management

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
consultant patrick lencioni who's

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
defined what he calls

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,319
the five dysfunctions of a team so

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
starting from the bottom the first is

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
the absence of trust which occurs when

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
team members are reluctant to be

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
vulnerable with each other

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
and are unwilling to admit their

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,199
mistakes weaknesses or needs for help

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
right so without a certain comfort level

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
among team members a foundation of trust

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
is impossible

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,800
and teams that are lacking in trust are

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,039
incapable of engaging in unfiltered

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
passionate debate about key issues

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,880
causing situations where team conflict

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,720
can easily turn into veiled discussions

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
and back channel comments

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
in a work setting where team members

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,759
don't openly air their opinions

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,400
inferior decisions are often the result

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,479
so without conflict it's difficult for

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,080
team members to commit to decisions

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,919
creating an environment where ambiguity

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
prevails lack of direction and

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,919
commitment

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,520
can make employees disgruntled and when

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
teams don't commit to a clear course of

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,840
action even the most focused and driven

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,599
individuals hesitate to call out their

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
peers on actions and behaviors that may

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
seem counterproductive to the overall

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
good of the team

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,039
so team members naturally tend to put

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
their own needs ego

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,120
care career development recognition etc

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,639
ahead of the collective goals of the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
team when individuals aren't held

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
accountable

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
so if team has lost sight of the need

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
for achievement the business ultimately

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
suffers

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
so we know that this concept of trust

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,039
among team members is foundational to

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,199
team success

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,120
it's also known as psychological safety

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
which dr amy edmondson defines as a

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
belief that one will

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
not be punished or humiliated for

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
speaking up with ideas questions

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,000
concerns or mistakes

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
describes a team climate characterized

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
by interpersonal trust and mutual

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
respect in which people are comfortable

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
being themselves

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,479
now dr edmondson didn't invent the

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
concept of psychological safety but she

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,520
spent much of her career studying in a

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
wide variety of industries and

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
organizations and her work has been

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
highly influential on others

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
her research helped informed a major

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
initiative at google a few years back

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
to identify the characteristics of high

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,560
performing teams and to encourage those

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,800
characteristics and others

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
and that google initiative which is

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,840
known as project aristotle

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,520
identified uh heritage of effective

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
teams at google

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,400
first psychological safety right team

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
with high psychological safety

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,720
teammates feel safe to take risks around

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
their team members

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
the second is dependability on

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
dependable teams

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
members reliably complete quality work

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,879
on time they hold each other

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,159
and themselves accountable you have

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,760
structure and clarity

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
individuals have a clear understanding

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,440
of job expectations the process for

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,839
fulfilling those expectations

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
and the consequences of one's

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,360
performance goals can be said at the

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
individual

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,160
group level but they must be specific

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
challenging and attainable

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,519
team members find a purpose a sense of

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
purpose and meaning

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
in the work that they do the meaning of

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
work is personal and varies by

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
individual

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
whether it's financial security

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,800
supporting their family helping the team

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,320
succeed or individual self-expression

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
and finally they're able to see the

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
impact of their work and how it's making

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
a difference in the world or

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
contributing to their organization's

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
goals

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,160
uh also remember factors that did not

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,200
appear to have a significant

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
team effectiveness um like they were in

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
the same location

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
or distributed whether they all agreed

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
on the decisions they were making

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,320
how extroverted they were how good each

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,160
individual team member was at their job

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
how much experience they'd had or how

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,000
long they've been at the company

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
now what's interesting is that while at

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
google the team size didn't appear to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,959
make a difference

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
they acknowledge that there's a large

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,200
body of research that finds that smaller

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
teams of less than 10

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,839
are not only the most effective but they

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,160
also very often have the best work life

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
balance

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
so a good way to sum all this up is with

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,519
this quote by babe ruth that one of our

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
team members put up in our office during

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,519
our retreat last year

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
it says the way a team plays together as

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
a whole determines

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,880
its success you may have the greatest

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,959
bunch of individual stars in the world

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,839
but if they don't play together the club

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,160
won't be worth the dime

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
so how do teams learn how to play

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
together right

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,360
so the combination of both individual

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,040
and team practices

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
so if you're a leader on a team or

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
within your organization there's some

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,680
behaviors you can model for others to

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,160
foster psychological safety

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,959
right these include demonstrating

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,760
engagement

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,519
um by being present focusing on the

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
conversation

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
you know close your laptop during

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,640
meetings be aware of your body language

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,360
make eye contact uh offering input

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,360
being interactive showing your listening

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,720
responding verbally to show engagement

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
that makes sense tell me more asking

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,279
questions

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,839
with the intention of actually learning

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,000
from other people on your team

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
uh showing understanding by validating

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
comments verbally recapping what's been

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
said to confirm mutual understanding and

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
alignment

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,240
you know for example like so what i

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,600
heard you say is

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,200
and then rephrase what they've said uh

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
acknowledge areas of agreement

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
disagreement and being open to questions

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
within the group

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
right uh avoid when things go wrong

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
avoid placing

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
blame and instead focus on solutions so

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
yeah

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
how can we work toward making sure that

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,600
this goes better next time

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,040
um being inclusive in interpersonal

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
settings by sharing information about

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
your personal work style and preferences

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
and encouraging your teammates to do the

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
same

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,120
a little later on we'll actually talk

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,680
about some tools for doing this

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
um being available and approachable to

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
teammates you know making time for ad

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,040
hoc one-on-one conversations

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,519
feedback sessions career coaching and

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
and clearly communicating the purpose of

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,640
ad hoc meetings that are scheduled

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
outside normal one-on-ones or team

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
meetings right

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
no one wants to hear their manager come

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,959
to them and say we need to talk

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,720
without explaining why

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,240
showing gratitude for contributions from

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,959
the team stepping in if team members

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,519
talk negatively about other team members

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
and building rapport making small talk

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
with your teammates about their lives

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,920
outside of work

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,839
being inclusive in decision making by

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
soliciting input opinions and feedback

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
from your teammate

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,720
explaining the reasoning behind your

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,720
decisions making sure that other

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
people's ideas are heard

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
don't interrupt them acknowledge input

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
from others when they contributed to a

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,040
success or

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,040
decision showing confidence

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
and conviction without appearing and

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,399
flexible

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
you do this by managing team discussions

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
they don't get sidetracked but also

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,079
inviting them to challenge your

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
perspective

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,519
and push back right model vulnerability

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,399
by sharing your personal perspective

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,000
on work and failures with your teammates

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
support and represent the team within

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
the organization

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
encourage them to take risks and

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,680
demonstrate risk taking in your

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
own work all right so all that seems

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,880
like a lot to remember

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
fortunately there are some tools and

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,760
frameworks that can help

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
so one of the tools that we use at

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,519
palantir to support psychological safety

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,680
is the core protocols

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,639
which framework of patterns and

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,959
practices

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,399
that are to help teams develop a shared

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,360
vision and understanding so they can

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,680
quickly and effectively make decisions

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
so in addition to promoting emotional

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,760
awareness empathy and presence

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
the core protocols also establish easily

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
agreed upon ground rules and commitments

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
that support

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,639
positive results-oriented behavior so

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
last year we worked with

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,639
author teacher and coach richard

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,720
kasparovsky who provided remote

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
workshops for two cohorts of our team

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
members to help us learn how to better

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,360
understand and utilize the core

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,680
protocols

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,600
and because richard used uh so many of

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
the same remote collaboration tools that

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,720
we use with our clients every day

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,160
you know zoom slack trello etc our team

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
was really able to see how these

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
practices

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,680
can work in a remote context some of

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
them like

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,600
there's the check in protocol which asks

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
people to take turns sharing their

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
emotional state

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,800
at the beginning of a meeting felt a

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,000
little awkward and uncomfortable at

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,040
first right

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,120
but with continued practice they soon

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,360
became a natural and integrated part of

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,680
our daily team interactions

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,920
so we now have a set of tools that

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
enable us to make decisions more quickly

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
ask for help when needed and just

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
generally be more aware of ourselves on

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,279
each other

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,959
so many of us found that using the core

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,240
protocols helped us to better understand

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,760
and appreciate each other

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,199
which in turn led to improved

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
communication and team morale

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
another tool that's key to the success

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,880
of self-organizing teams is a team

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
charter simply put this is a living

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
document that defines

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
team objectives operating principles and

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
working arrangements

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,360
it's put together by all of the members

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
of the team at the beginning of the

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
project

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,440
and revisited periodically as the

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
project evolves

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,560
or the composition of the team changes

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,120
in addition to defining who the team is

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
or and what they're setting out to do

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,639
how they intend to approach it

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
the charter also defines expectations

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,880
for how the team will hold itself

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
accountable

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,680
and how they will resolve conflicts if

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
they arise

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,920
and one of the components of the team

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
charter are personal user manuals which

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
are tools to

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,880
design to help team members document and

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
share their individual preferences for

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,839
how they like to collaborate and

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,079
communicate

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,040
so this would include things like what

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,199
times of the day

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
you tend to get the most work done how

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,399
you like to organize your work

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,880
personal preferences regarding deadlines

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,880
how much

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
structure you prefer and what you're

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
hoping to learn

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,199
by working from this team working with

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,199
this team

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,079
and another concept that we've also

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
introduced at palantir is that of the

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,240
andon cord which comes from the toyota

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
production system

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
so at every station on a toyota assembly

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
line there there's like

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,240
actually a cord that the worker is

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,120
expected to pull if they see a problem

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,560
the cord rings a chime lights up a board

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
to allow managers to see where the

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
problem is and

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,600
fix it as close to the source as

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
possible they try to fix the problems in

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
real time if possible

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
but they have no problem with stopping

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,279
the line if needed

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,800
and and this system is in marked

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,880
contrast to the way that

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,120
american automakers ran their production

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
lines in the 1970s

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
where the line was only stopped in

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,079
extreme circumstances

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
and problems weren't fixed until the

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,920
very end and

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
this actually took a lot more time and

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,440
resulted in much

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,320
lower quality outcomes so this was the

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,360
era of

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,440
the chevy corvair and the ford pinto

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
and these other vehicles that were just

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
you know

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,480
legendary for having poor quality

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
so in order for the toyota system to

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
work however

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
they had to foster a culture of

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
psychological safety where it was made

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,519
clear that

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,240
asking questions and pointing out

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,040
defects were positive not negative

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
things

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,760
and it's extended all the way to the

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
design of the andon cord system itself

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,919
so in american factories when there was

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
a problem they had to stop the line

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
they play this like loud terrible

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
sounding clacks on horn

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
on the toyota lines when you pull the

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
end on cord it plays

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
a pleasant musical chime so i think in

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
the american factories it's like

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,600
london bridge is falling down but they

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,079
they you know

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,280
tailor which song it is based on on

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,520
which region where their factories are

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
so when we apply this to the context of

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,480
the work that we do

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
right we encourage teams to ask

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
themselves some questions when they're

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,039
coming together to work on a project

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,559
right so first if someone on the team

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
has a question or see something that

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,799
doesn't look right

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,720
how do they raise that with others

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,400
second what happens when questions or

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,039
concerns are raised how do they get

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
addressed

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,520
who's involved if it's a systemic issue

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,039
how does it get communicated to others

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,799
third if it's an issue that can't be

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
fixed in real time and might result in a

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,160
pause or a delay

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,200
how does that decision get made how is

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,240
it communicated not just to the

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,760
sourcing and to other stakeholders and

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
finally it's really important for folks

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
to

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
ask themselves why they might hesitate

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
to raise concerns

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,080
be open and talk about that at the

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,000
outset of the project and figure out

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,840
some ways to mitigate those concerns so

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,840
the problems don't go unreported or

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
unaddressed

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,240
so i want to move on now from talking

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
about how we support psychological

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,559
safety within project teams

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,400
and talk about some of the ways we work

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,679
to support psychological safety at an

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,880
organizational level

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
and i'm actually going to take a sip of

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,000
coffee before i do that

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,640
all right so starting around two years

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,200
ago at valentier

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,880
we decided after years of trying patches

00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
for the same old cracks it was time for

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
us to

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
step back and take a comprehensive look

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
at our company

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
our strategy structure processes and

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,160
practices

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,039
in order to more effectively serve both

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,320
our internal and external audiences

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,840
and one of the uh the breakthrough

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
insights we made is that

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
while we used agile practices and agile

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,360
tools

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
in our work every day we had not yet

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,960
internalized

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,440
agile values and collectively had not

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,799
yet developed an agile mindset as an

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,520
organization

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,559
right so agile is not just about

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,960
backlogs scrums and story points

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,400
it's also about embracing the complexity

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
of the problems that we're trying to

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
solve

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,480
creating an environment that empowers

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,640
and enables people to be able to work

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
together in an interdependent way

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,640
and a culture that embraces continuous

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,799
learning and improvement

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,240
so we identified a few key priorities

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
that we needed to work on to help us

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,400
become

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,559
a more agile organization first was to

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
optimize for focus and flow

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,000
so that teams and team members can do

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,679
their best work

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,280
we restructured how projects were

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,919
resourced so that team members could be

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,559
able to be

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,679
focused with fewer projects competing

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,520
for their attention

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
so they were able to work more often in

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
flow

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,039
second we needed to make sure that

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
connection support

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,240
learning and development were an

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,039
integrated part of

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
project team work not supplemental or

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,320
apart from it

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
this meant creating space for organized

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,000
learning around discipline skills

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,840
as well as multiple regular touch points

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
for feedback support and growth for

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,480
individuals

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
third we needed to deepen the connection

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,760
between the organization and projects

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,960
and accelerate how project innovation

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,679
impacts us organizationally this meant

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,799
uh emphasizing stable small teams of

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,799
roughly eight people

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,039
to support connection collaboration and

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,600
learning having fewer large group

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
meetings

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,880
right management roles were refocused

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,760
on facilitation collaboration and

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,440
coaching with direct visibility into an

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,360
engagement in day-to-day project

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,559
operations

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
and finally we needed to better

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
articulate the structure in which

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,039
individuals and teams work

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,400
for individuals we did this by

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,640
establishing an equitable and

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,960
transparent compensation structure

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,520
with defined salary levels that provide

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
equal pay for equal responsibilities

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,799
and creating a role-based structure to

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,080
support professional self-assessment and

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,520
career road mapping

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,240
we'll talk a little bit more more of

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,000
these in a bit for teams we created a

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,559
set of playbooks to provide the default

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,640
structure of how we do it here so that

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,320
teams could customize their approach

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,640
instead of building from scratch every

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,640
time

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
and because we're applying an agile

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,919
mindset to this work it means that we're

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
constantly

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,320
experimenting adapting and improving the

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559
way we do things right

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,240
the agile process is structured so teams

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,559
build knowledge progressively through

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
experimentation and iteration

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,320
many of the challenges we face are

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,480
complex adaptive problems

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
meaning that by trying to solve these

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,600
problems we

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
actually change the nature of the

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,000
problem itself

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,840
right and it also means that the end

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,440
solution is not predictable at the

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
outset

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,000
so by embracing this uncertainty up

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,679
front we can ultimately deliver better

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,840
results for our clients

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
as a team we're building tools and

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,000
structures that help us become more

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,919
comfortable

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
operating in this complexity and provide

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
better ways to help our clients navigate

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,600
it as well

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,799
instead of focusing on outputs our goal

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,480
is to help our clients

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,200
articulate desired outcomes

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,039
so we know from both nature and the

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
research on effective businesses

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,480
that the most successful organizations

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
are the ones who know how to adapt and

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,720
innovate quickly to an evolving

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,799
understanding of complex situations

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
working as interconnected collaborating

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,000
teams of people

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,360
focused on a shared goal

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
so one of the structures we've been

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,080
iterating on over the last year and a

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
half or so

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,600
is that of the professional and

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,880
organizational development team

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,960
or pod the idea here is that every team

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
member has a dedicated

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,559
team who provides facilitation

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,400
collaboration coaching

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,360
on performance growth and development

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,240
goals it includes both a representative

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,000
of your chapter or discipline as well as

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,760
a company team member and both of these

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,799
folks look at your performance growth

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,799
and development through multiple lenses

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,240
pods meet both as a group and in

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
one-on-one settings

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,520
and we found that this team approach

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,000
actually helps promote more

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,600
open honest and meaningful discussions

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
because team members know that their

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
career

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
path at the company isn't dependent on

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,640
any single individual or any single

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,640
manager

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
so in order to provide team members with

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,080
structure and clarity on how to grow

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,039
their career

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,799
we've also spent that time developing a

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,640
role-based framework to support

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,159
professional self-assessment and career

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,320
development

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,279
so at palantir we have defined salary

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,159
levels that provide

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,039
equal pay for equal responsibilities the

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,039
rbs

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,039
articulates the skills and expectations

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,760
for each level so that individuals and

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,360
pods

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
can then orient learning and growth

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
conversations around

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
a standard for promotions and

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,200
opportunities the examples in the rbs

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,880
aren't prescriptive but are provided

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,039
to help give a sense of what types of

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
behavior skills and responsibilities

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,159
we would expect from someone at a given

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,080
level

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,360
uh fundamentally the structure is based

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
on the premise that

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,880
the company benefits substantially from

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,120
the increased development of all team

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,960
members right so there's no target for

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,039
the number of people at any given level

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
and level increases happen when the

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,919
expectations for the next level have

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,320
been met

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
every position is a growth position

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,480
okay so you're an adaptive agile

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
organization full of

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,039
self-organizing teams who makes the

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,360
decisions

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,320
right and one model that's worked really

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
well for us

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
uh is a model we like to call the

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,159
decision tree

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,159
though this decision tree is is very

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,760
different from the kind of decision tree

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,880
algorithm that you might be familiar

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,880
with

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,400
basically we divide up the kinds of

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
decisions that can be made

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,080
into categories based on impact within

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,919
the organization

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,960
and risk right so uh so so a leaf

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,679
decision is one that has

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
no risk to the business no impact to

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,120
anyone other than

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
yourself right so you can make this

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
decision on your

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,679
own right example would be um

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,679
i'm going to use some of my like

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,960
discretionary money

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,919
to buy a new headset right

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
then we have branch decisions branch

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,080
decisions are

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,720
ones that you still make yourself

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,679
but you consider the impact on others

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,080
and give them

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,000
visibility into the decision and what

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,400
the expected outcomes are

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
right so you may need to tweak as needed

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,559
uh example of this would be like

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
hey i'd like to take some of my uh

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,520
professional development time to attend

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
drupalcon

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,480
which means i might only be working half

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,039
time on my projects this week

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
right so that has an impact on others

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,200
and

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,720
that's going to be something you need to

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
consult and communicate with others

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,960
about

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,600
and then you have a trunk decision and

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,000
the consequences on a trunk decision are

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
are bigger or more likely right and this

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
is this is something that's going to

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,080
require consultation with

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,200
experts and those impacted um an example

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,840
here would be like

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,000
uh we'd like to purchase a site license

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,279
for new software to host our project

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
documentation

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,000
right and so when everyone

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
you know shares um equally in the

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,880
outcome

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,159
um on a team right if this is a team

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
level decision

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,919
they can make that decision themselves

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,520
through a consent process right which

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,400
could be the decider protocol

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,840
or whatever the team decides agrees on

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,000
right

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,279
um then you have root decisions

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
and these are ones where kind of

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,600
literally the fate of the business is at

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
stake

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,360
right this decision is made at the

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,159
c-suite level and requires input from

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,880
all

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,000
relevant perspectives on you know terms

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
of impact

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
and expertise right uh example here

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
would be

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,760
you know we'd like to change our

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,039
hourly billing rates uh so

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,799
for those decisions that have um

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,240
you know greater organizational

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
ramifications or

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,520
asymmetrical ownership an advice process

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,919
right where you seek out the various

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,120
perspectives put together a proposal

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,720
and talk to those with experience and

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,720
with those impact it is much more

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,000
appropriate to use

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,600
all right so when it comes to promoting

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,480
psychological safety

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,399
um the structure of the organization is

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,360
also vitally important

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,559
um so a few years back frederick lalu

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,039
published this book called

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,000
invent reinventing organizations in

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,000
which he defined

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,120
several stages of organizational

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,960
development

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,080
really kind of designed to mirror

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,200
different stages of human development

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,480
and so organizations that are further

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,320
along in this scale

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,919
uh demonstrate better results and

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,919
increase team engagement

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
as well as higher levels of trust and

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,399
consciousness of their work and the

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,559
impact it has on the world around them

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,760
uh at the bottom so the lower left of

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,440
your screen there

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
he defined organizations that are

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,159
characterized by power structure and

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,480
hierarchy

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,799
right so uh so he's got red

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,760
organizations which rely solely on power

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,320
and authority right

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
do this or be punished right great

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,760
example of this is

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,480
organized crime syndicates they're all

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,480
about power and authority

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,120
then you have amber organizations which

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,880
have more hierarchy and structures so

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
that they're more of command and control

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,000
organizations so the military would be a

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
good example of this

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,520
public school administration systems

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,720
might be another example

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,480
right and you have orange

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,799
and orange is where most of corporate

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,240
america lives today especially

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,080
startups you know uh you know

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,760
agencies folks like that and they're

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,919
focused on

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,440
recognizing and rewarding individual

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,640
achievement innovation

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
do well be rewarded right so this is

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
this is

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,880
peak capitalism essentially right and

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,679
and the the problem is that what you can

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
do a lot within this model it's

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,279
exhausting

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,399
and it leads to burnout and and it means

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,440
that the teams

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,120
don't stick together long enough

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
to really do things that are truly

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,399
innovative

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,159
so then we have green organizations

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,399
green organizations are ones that still

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
have hierarchy but they're focused on

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
people

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
and they're driven by a broader purpose

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,440
and value right so

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
these are the places where everyone is

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,000
is treated like family

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,320
right for better or worse right and

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
there's many great organizations that

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
live here

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,399
uh southwest airlines is a good example

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,720
ben and jerry's is another example

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,760
you know most non-profit organizations

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,520
are here

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,640
uh but the dr to garner consensus within

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,120
the context

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,360
of a hierarchy often means that these

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,279
kinds of organizations

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,360
have difficulty figuring out how to make

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,399
decisions

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,440
so and you have way up in the corner

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,399
right the teal organizations and the loo

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
defines these

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,679
as purpose-driven organizations that

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,399
consist

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,080
of self-organized interconnected teams

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,000
so if in these organizations there's

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,360
little or no hierarchy

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
people are encouraged to bring their

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,559
whole selves to their work and to

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,399
collaborate with each other to find ways

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,960
to solve complex problems

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,279
without being told what to do the

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,480
dominant paradigm is sense and respond

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:06,240
right uh think like patagonia

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:10,399
or the makers of gore-tex right

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,159
and teal requires being open to new ways

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
of looking at things and this model the

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,840
organization is

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,039
functions more like a living organism

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,880
where the different parts

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,880
all work together to support the whole

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,360
so the overall trend here is from models

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
that rely

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,200
on dependents to ones that rely on

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,240
independence

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,960
to ones that rely on interdependence

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,960
right the reality is that hierarchies

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,880
aren't well equipped to solve complex

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,679
problems because they're always pushing

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
things

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,039
to make things simpler and more

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,919
predictable

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,840
right organizations that are able to

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,519
embrace uncertainty and unpredictability

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,120
are stronger and more stable

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,559
and have better results and higher

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,279
employee satisfaction than more

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,799
traditional companies in their sectors

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,039
so i say that's a good question in the

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
chat is the drupal community close to a

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,360
teal team

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,200
you know i would i would say that that

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,799
the drupal community

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,240
is uh like the reality of most

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,120
organizations

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,200
that it's a combination of different

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
color organizations right

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
um you know we are this very broad

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,600
distributed community and there are

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
you know there are parts of drupal that

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,279
i think you know

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,480
do function in a very teal way and it's

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,600
it's open source

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,000
naturally encourages this

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,640
there are parts i think that function

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,279
also

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,000
in a very green way and parts that

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,240
function in an

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,640
orange way and you know

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,880
and the reality is like there are very

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,240
few organizations that are

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,159
you know all orange or all green or all

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,279
teal we're all this kind of

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,960
you know patchwork configuration and

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,840
i i think the drupal community is a good

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
example of that

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,480
so when we're going and talking about

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,799
those organizations that are

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,919
you know closer to that that teal level

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,440
right

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,880
they're also a lot more resilient and

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,960
this is how we learn uh as individuals

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,120
and as organizations

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,600
to adapt to challenges in uncertain

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,080
times and come out stronger on the other

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,960
side

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
right so especially as we're we're all

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,320
dealing with everything

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,240
that's going on in the world today right

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
the global pandemic

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,200
racial injustice climate change and

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,679
countless other complex problems

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,519
we're all going to need to learn how to

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,760
continue to build resilience

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,120
in both our professional lives and our

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,559
personal lives

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,000
right but in order to do that we need to

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,000
have the space

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,080
to be aware of our own needs and the

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,320
needs of those around us

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,840
which is even more challenging right now

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,640
when we're all working from our own

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
homes and we

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
aren't able to physically be present

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,679
with other people

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,960
right so having a psychologically safe

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,120
environment

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,279
helps make it easier to have that

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,560
awareness and to be more in tune with

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,520
others

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,359
having that space to be our

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,679
authentically human selves

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,760
is what's going to enable us to create

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,679
the context and opportunity

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,240
as we plan ahead for the future that we

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,040
want to build together

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,119
all right thank you that's the

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,919
presentation part here

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,960
and let's see what questions we have

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,240
uh among your investments hey hi doug uh

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,560
through your investments

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,079
the iterating of policy procedure

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
practices

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,520
can you identify scenarios where roi was

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:50,159
realized sooner versus later did any roi

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:53,119
uh timing surprise you um

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,879
yeah i i would say one of the uh one of

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,000
the things we saw

00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,440
uh improve pretty early on

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,800
uh was uh was you know measurable client

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,560
satisfaction

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,040
uh and um you know and and it was

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,400
very very interesting to see like just

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,520
sort of how quickly that

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,000
that um that impact took place um

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,839
the team really felt like they had the

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,200
space and the flexibility

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
um you know to you know to serve the

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,880
client's needs

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,359
the clients ended up being a lot more

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,560
satisfied as a result

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,160
so yes adam goodman uh hey adam

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,680
um yes

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:41,200
uh e equal equal space equal time

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,680
uh is absolutely important um i will say

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,800
this is one i'm still working on

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,359
personally

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,320
making sure that you know in a meeting

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,359
or in a room

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,240
uh you know it's it's it's not me taking

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,920
up all the air and

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,599
and making sure that other folks have

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,640
have that opportunity

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,960
and and have that space um to to share

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,720
and

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
and yeah it really does make teams work

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
better

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,599
um observe relationship where a team

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,800
sits

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,160
on the color spectrum and other

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,400
parameters such as experience or

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,079
compensation levels so

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,680
that's a fantastic question and i don't

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,280
fully know the answer to that

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
um i would probably go back to

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,200
the research that they did at um

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,960
that google did at project aristotle uh

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,720
where they they really didn't

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,320
see um you know uh

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,760
experience um or compensation or tenure

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,800
or any of those things

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,440
um having uh

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
being a factor on highly effective teams

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,320
so

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,839
um you know i would think a truly teal

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,240
organization would be

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,520
able to you know would bring together

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,560
people of all different

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,640
you know skill and experience levels um

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,720
yeah i think i think adam is correct

00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,520
there adam by the way for folks who

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,000
don't know

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,280
is also kind of an expert on this these

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,359
things way more than i am

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,599
so if if he's replying to something in

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,480
the chat he probably

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,480
has studied it longer than i have um

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
team members have a good sense of uh

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,320
leaf versus trunk versus root

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,960
yeah um i i think um you know

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,640
introducing the concept surely um but

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,440
yeah understanding it's

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,440
you know um that's always a conversation

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,160
it's like well i thought this was a leaf

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,040
decision

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,920
and it turned out to be a trunk decision

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,760
um

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,760
you know is something and that's why

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,520
that kind of validation is important

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,520
especially um early on

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320
all right well lots of questions here

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,040
i'm going to try and go through the back

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,440
scroll here

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,920
[Music]

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,960
so so michelle says yep having zoom

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,720
meetings

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,960
with all office once a week yep that

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,760
again that's being increasing that

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,960
awareness of

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,320
others uh is is so important

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,880
and one of the interesting things

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,240
about this sort of remote world that

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,160
we're all living in now

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
our company has been remote for the last

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
like fully remote for the last five or

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,359
six years

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,760
so you know we've had time to practice

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,359
this

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,079
but um you know being able to get

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,480
together

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
and you know i think it goes back to the

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,960
point earlier about having

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,000
uh equal opportunity and time and space

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,280
for sharing

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,960
right in and you don't always

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
necessarily get that in a physical

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,720
office environment

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,240
the you know the the zoom or google

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,280
hangout culture

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,119
where everyone is there you know almost

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,520
kind of pushes the issue a little bit

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,000
more

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
right so it makes it more likely i think

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,880
that

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
you know uh folks will have that space

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,880
because it's harder to kind of

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,359
hide in the corner

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,920
the trigger to pull the end on cord you

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,800
know what

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,160
that's something um i think the team

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,640
needs to figure out

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,640
right and um yeah i mean

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,079
i i would think if if your project team

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
is getting together that is a

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
conversation they're going to

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
have it's like hey at what point you

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,280
know is this

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,200
is this user story taking longer

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,960
anticipated where i i might need to let

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,520
someone else know about it

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,400
and and being really open and clear

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
about that

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,880
at the beginning of the project before

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,520
you've even started

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,960
all right brian says you see your

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,560
experience steal teams existing with an

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,440
organization that's less steel yeah

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,800
i mean absolutely um you know one of the

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,079
um

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,480
i was at a workshop last year and

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,200
um it was a lot of folks who were

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,640
running

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,160
very agile teams within

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,400
very large hierarchical organizations

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,320
and you know so you sometimes see these

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,200
kinds of pockets

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,640
uh you know within organizations where

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,440
people are able to run

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,960
in a more open way and you know one of

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,480
the things we were talking about is

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,079
is is how to get that um

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,839
you know how to encourage that culture

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,040
within the organization

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,359
um and it really does rely on

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
people at the executive level being open

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,839
to it

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,720
all right

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,720
terms of dedicated amias in terms of

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,400
dedicated time for professional

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,160
development

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,960
how do teams balance us against

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,440
deliverables um

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,480
you know uh that that is that is a

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,760
conversation

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,280
uh the team needs to have right and

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,280
you know i think

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,920
if the team understands and agrees on

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,599
what they're trying to achieve uh what

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,480
the outcomes are that they're looking

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,560
for

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,560
um you know if there is if there is

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,319
ideal in an ideal world if there is

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,040
professional development

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,520
that helps the team achieve its goals

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,040
then

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,560
yeah you want to work that in right um

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,880
bring something back um but

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
you know one of the things we've really

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,880
tried to emphasize is that

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,800
professional development isn't is not a

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
thing that's apart from the work you do

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,760
it is

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,640
a natural part of the work that you do

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,760
right

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,760
so um working to figure out how to

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
integrate that as much as possible is

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
key

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,280
okay i've got a couple more minutes

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,000
i'm gonna answer doug's questions

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,680
individuals who were more waterfall by

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,280
nature and did not completely understand

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,560
or appreciate the process initially

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,640
yeah absolutely um and you know we had

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,880
folks within the organization

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,160
um as we were making this you know

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,599
evolution change

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,400
um decide that this wasn't for them

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,160
and that was fine um you know i think

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,640
it's particularly hard

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,520
uh if your experience or background is

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,560
from a kind of traditional management

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,040
uh structure if your experience is you

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,119
know

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,520
hey my job is to incentivize people

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,319
you know to do the things i want them to

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
do

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,839
uh then this is gonna be a hard

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,640
transition

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,200
um you know we definitely did have folks

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,319
who

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,960
um were able to really embrace the idea

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,520
that

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
hey you know i'm not a manager now i'm

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,760
more of a coach

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,160
um and and that's been very successful

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,839
but

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,839
you know it's not for everyone

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,800
let me see whatever all right whatever

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,560
questions i have time for here

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,079
all right so yes um i want to

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,200
um make sure that folks see adam's link

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,800
there

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,480
to a resource for remote teams

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,800
and then just very briefly touch on a

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,839
couple of questions about

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,560
diversity unconscious bias one of the

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:18,960
things we're really trying to do

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:22,560
is create a structure that mitigates

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,359
as much of that bias as possible right

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,280
so

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,359
when we talk about things like the pod

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,040
structure and the rbs

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,520
it's really designed to make sure that

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,480
um you know conversations about whether

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,800
it's hiring

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,800
or promotion or anything like that those

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,599
are being

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,040
those are happening in a way where you

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,960
know there is

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,079
a fully understood and transparent

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
structure it

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,720
is designed to be fair and equitable and

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,160
people do understand

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,560
you know um what what it is

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,640
that will you know that will help them

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,200
uh you know

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,920
succeed within the organization and you

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,839
know

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,680
so so i think that will help

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,319
the ideas that that will help mitigate

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,640
some of those some of those biases

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,640
so all right

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,960
so i'm not sure how much time we have

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,800
left um

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,440
yeah the the remote structure um

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
the um

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,040
we have found it a lot easier for our

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,720
team you know

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,480
not just because we're used to working

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,640
remotely but because of the groundwork

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,119
we've laid over the year

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,920
previously you know i think that the

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,960
team members

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,440
are obviously still dealing with

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,560
you know personal issues of you know

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,040
isolation

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,319
and things like that we did bring in a

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,040
mindfulness

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,440
consultant um to help out so we do both

00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,119
one-on-ones in group sessions there

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,040
um but um yeah that's uh

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,480
uh that's that's the thing we're we're

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,240
all struggling with in one way or

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,640
another but

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,560
being able to develop that culture of

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,960
psychological safety having that space

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,359
has

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,839
i think helped us um you know handle

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,079
handle this transition a lot a lot

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,400
better

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,400
right

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,400
all right so uh thank you all very much

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,520
