so for whatever reason the slides aren't

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,639
showing up well or anything else like

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
that

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
um you can find it at the link there

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,360
i've got links to

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,480
uh pretty much anything else that i

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
mentioned in here there's a lot of

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
articles and other things like that in

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
there

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,920
um really really appreciate uh drupalcon

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,840

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
i really am bummed that i don't get to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,360
see a lot of uh

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,200
old-time drupal colleagues in person um

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,399
so i guess typing and chatting and video

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,760
over the next couple of days is gonna

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
have to do

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
um and what i'm here to talk to you

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
about is drupal and the decentralized

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,840
web

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,960
so let's get started uh

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
please feel free to uh type a queue uh

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
if you have a question

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
uh comments or links to other things

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,239
talk amongst yourselves is fine too but

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
if you

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,399
i'll help look for a cue and ask your

00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,120
questions along the way if you if you

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
like

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
um we've got about 45 minutes and i've

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,559
got

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,240
about 45 minutes of slides to go through

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,960
but uh some of them are mean so they

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,960
should go quickly

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,360
i think that's the only gratuitous

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,000
animation uh so welcome

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,840
uh my name is boris mann uh i got

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,720
involved in drupal

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,200
well a long long time ago uh back in

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,079
2003 um it was

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
uh super exciting for me it was my first

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,640
uh

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
open source project that i uh that i got

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
involved with

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,920
um if i recall correctly i made a um

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
a suggestion to mosh who is maintaining

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
the the the

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
recipe module that we should add some

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,880
css classes

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
um more recently um and i've i

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,759
was involved early with a lot of the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
events and i helped found the drupal

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,799
association

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,479
um so i was there for the beginning of

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
drupal and i've kind of wandered off and

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
done other things and i'm i'm coming

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
back to checking on the community and so

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
amazing to see how much it's grown

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
um you know it's amazing to see the

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,879
driest note this morning and see that

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,720
that drupal's still going strong

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,000
um in the last little little while i've

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
gotten involved with

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,239
a lot of things that broadly are

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
speaking uh called the decentralized web

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
or

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
blockchains and distributed systems i

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,239
spent some time with the ethereum

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
community which is one of the major

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
programmable blockchains

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
um helping out with community and events

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
because that's what i do

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
and some core development as well

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
organizing the events around it

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
um and right now what i'm doing is i'm

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
the co-founder of a company called

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
fission

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,440
and we're making open source developer

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
tools

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,879
um that ideally make it really easy for

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
a front-end developer

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,160
um to never have to learn the back end

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
which is different than where we are

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
today with with drupal and where

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
drupal's history is

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
so i do actually want to go back so i

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,280
looked at some photos

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,040
um i'm pretty sure this is um

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,640
at the fosdem um

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,680
in uh uh in brussels um

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,200
where uh um we went every year

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,120
in uh in 2005 um uh this is my

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
handwriting telling you that uh

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
you know all the cool things about

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,440
drupal and let me tell you what was cool

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
things like

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,760
the gpl open source was super cool at

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,680
the time

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,840
and web 2 with many exclamation marks

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
um and even then we said that you know

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
drupal was a lot of things a php based

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,879
cms

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
a web application framework maybe it was

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
a community website and blogging tool

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,280
and there was a bunch of buzzwords

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,000
uh ajax and rss and aggregation and

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
syndication and tagging and blogs and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,840
let me tell you those things were novel

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,879
and it was this transition from web one

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
to web two

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,480
and in fact there was a bunch of other

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
stuff happening around open source

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
we were a small embattled crew fighting

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,040
a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,519
from microsoft uh open source was not a

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,640
thing

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,920
that people were okay with um and

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,280
we kind of are today so

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
i am gonna say that the centralized web

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
is a label that we can use we sometimes

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
also use the label dweb

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
to shorten it and put it in a hashtag

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,320
you could call it decentralized you call

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,440
it distributed

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,800
this move from web 2 to web3

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,600
it's a little strange of course so

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
uh interesting quote i found from john

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
evans in a techconch article

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
um so the internet itself it was

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,800
literally designed

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,080
on decentralized protocols and then we

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
used it to build services

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
on top like facebook twitter gmail

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
icloud

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
so massively centralized that they verge

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
on being

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
quasi medieval fiefdoms and i'm going to

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
say that

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,440
this place we've ended up in web 2 and

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
drupal helped us get there is not a

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,240
great place to be

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,479
so once again there's this tension

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
rising up that we want to move on

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240
and a new version and innovate and

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
change some of these things of where

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
we've ended up

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
so i mentioned open source what i've

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
really been finding is

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,360
i really cut my teeth and i learned a

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,560
ton of things about open source

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,759
about the culture and about like

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
literally the

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,160
the details of reading a license and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,919
some of the legalities around it

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,400
from those early days um with drupal and

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
and other early open source communities

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
um

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,360
the problem is that today i feel like

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
it's been watered down

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
um open source has faded in the

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,919
background and that's something else

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
that we maybe need to reacquaint

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,639
ourselves with

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
so the problem is that everybody means

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
something different so for some people

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,759
it's licensing

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,600
some of it is literally like open source

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,160
is a label for oh

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,199
they work in open source like a way of

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
working

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
and then people a little farther away

00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
are like that's crazy there's no one in

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,240
charge

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
um or conversely there's a benevolent

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,520
dictator for life

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,520
um and and what does that what does that

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,880
mean what does that look like

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,960
um and here's my definition of

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
of this phrase open source that i think

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
i think

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880
works well in bucketing various things

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,520
so there's the legal innovation

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
of licenses um we often think of

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
innovation as something that's being

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,840
purely

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,800
technological a computer science or an

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,800
algorithm

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
uh but i really think of it as a lot

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
broader than that

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
so it really was an innovation of

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
licenses and it was brought about

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
uh even by things like the copyright act

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
of 1976

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,759
where you had to um you you no longer

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
had to assert copyright

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
when you created something it was

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
automatically copyrighted it was

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
automatically proprietary

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
so what was needed were licenses that

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
you could

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
allow for reuse by default so you

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
copyrighted something

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,639
with a license that allowed people to

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,880
share and reuse it in different ways

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
i also think that open source is a way

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,560
of working together on

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
code on community collaboratively

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
asynchronously remotely

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,520
obviously a bunch of people right now

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
during the pandemic realizing oh this

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,039
this remote work

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,840
works um i've been doing remote work for

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,520
17 years so i'm like

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,440
yeah but we have to remember that a lot

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
of us involved in this are

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
well ahead of the curve and then finally

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,360
there is definitely ideology with this

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,319
concept of open source

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
of code reuse other things as well as

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
it's broadened

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,039
uh and sharing and this sort of

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,720
information wants to be free

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,000
and in part that comes from the fact

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,639
that um when we think about bits

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
this is for post scarcity why not share

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
it or even more

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
um directly we believe human knowledge

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
should be

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
open and available to everyone so that

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,800
we can build on top of it

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,360
um so uh a phrase i also wanted to share

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
early days from a long time ago is this

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
this way of working together actually

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
has a label it's called commons based

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
peer production

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
lots of people work on it everybody

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
benefits from it and then people can

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,599
build upon it

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,879
even in a revenue generating fashion um

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
and this is some of the language that we

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
really need to go back and research to

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,759
see how it applies today

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,280
so for the first time in 15 years we're

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
starting to see licensing innovation

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
again

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
and i think it's because open source has

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
been kind of

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,000
watered down um you know if you put up

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960
things on github and people just fork

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
stuff

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,039
and if everybody's open source and if

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,240
corporations take a bunch of open source

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,440
code and included a bunch of things

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,519
and now they're making all the money

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,600
and we're mainly contributing free labor

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
that's not a great place to be

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
um we've talked a lot about things like

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
sustainability um

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,240
how how can um open source maintainers

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,399
thrive i think thriving is a better word

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
than that sustainability work

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
so just a couple so a brief survey i've

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
got lots of links to these elsewhere

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,240
that you can dive into in more detail

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
so licensed zero friend of mine kyle

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
mitchell has done some really really

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,080
interesting work

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
parity is a license that basically says

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
share a like for open source if you keep

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
your code

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
open and available and contribute back

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
then you can use it

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
um and and again pass that right on to

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,560
others

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,480
if you want to use it closed source

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
something that is allowed under mit or

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
apache

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
then in fact this is sort of an

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
ideological license that says no you

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,880
need to

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,080
pay if you'd like to use this code close

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,920
source

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,920
which is interesting and then the other

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,040
one is prosperity which is very simple

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
it says

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,399
um keep it open keep it closed either or

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
don't

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
don't mind but you can only use the code

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
for

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
non-commercial purposes if you're going

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
to use it for commercial purposes if

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
you're going to use it in the context of

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
a company or if you're going to make

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,720
money using this code then you then you

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,080
need to buy a license from

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,760
from me then the maintainer or creator

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
and there's others so fair source is

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
very interesting it has some similar

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
models

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,800
to the prosperity non-commercial um

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
there's some awkwardness of whether

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
these things are labeled open source or

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
not

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
um and so faresource says not open

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,800
source not closed source

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,399
fair source uh 996

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,720
icu so super interesting to me

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,279
um i guess technically they should call

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
the the anti-996 icu

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
uh this is a license that came out of

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
china um

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
so china has a big tech industry there

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,959
and

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,720
uh they demand very long work hours uh

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,040
9 a.m to 9 00 p.m six days a week

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
um and this phrase is if you work that

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
long continuously

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
you'll you'll end up in the icu the

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,040
intensive care unit you'll damage your

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
health

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,440
so basically this license says that if

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
you want to use this code

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
you you can't have such extreme work

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,640
practices

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,240
um so fighting back against that um

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
ethical licenses are something that are

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
that are coming up

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,079
um on broad strokes as well as people

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
say that there's certain organizations

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,839
or activities that they don't want to

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,839
see used with uh with open source

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,440
and i think this really speaks well a

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,360
lot of these things to

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
really today's generation um we had gpl

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,399
we had mit and we

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,160
understood them to the degree that we

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
needed to we didn't think much further

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
of them

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
but we also didn't really focus on

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
diversity and inclusion um

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
so i think this is really great the

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,800
cross license collaborative super

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,839
fascinating

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,279
basically in the model where

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,360
you have a company that owns full

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,640
copyright on something on code and it

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
has maybe contributors

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
adding in will those contributors never

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,519
get anything and they can't really

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
fork it or do anything with it

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
necessarily um

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
and this is a way that says everybody

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,720
who's a contributor can

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
automatically get all of the same rights

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
and so instance there might even be

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,880
instances that say

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,839
hey if you sell paid licenses for this

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,120
code base

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,760
every single contributor actually shares

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
um in the in the revenue for that so

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,480
that kind of breaks the model of you

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,920
have to have one corporation or ruler

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,360
and encodes that in a license

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,279
so not quite open source but in the same

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
way the things that are changing

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,279
and the underpinnings of what i see as

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
web 3 is data ethics

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,839
so we're starting to see that people

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,120
care about data like their own data

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,880
um and so what requires software

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
developers or companies to act in

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,360
certain ways with data

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,440
the gpl and mit and apache they don't

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
they don't say anything about this and

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,360
it's barely something that we kind of

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,680
talk about right so

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
can anyone on your company team see the

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
database

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
what about the files that a user uploads

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
what where the

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,560
where are the rules around that and

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,279
there's both principles hello manuel

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
from mexico there's principles like the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,079
fair data society

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,000
and local first software to licenses

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,040
like the cryptographic autonomy license

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,680
or icepick icepicks also from

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,079
my friend kyle mitchell where basically

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
it's like a gpl license when it comes to

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
data

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,240
where it says that as a user

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,440
the developer must give you all systems

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
um that that are needed to be able to

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
run something

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
um ruth points out that there's national

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,160
laws like the gdpr

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,760
there are unfortunately they're not

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
really baked into some of the systems

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,560
that really matter

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,519
um i can give you uh a proprietary data

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
format

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
uh or a plain text dump that isn't

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
useful to you uh that you literally

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,240
can't

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,399
recreate your activities in an app

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
things like ice pick might say

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
you have to define the data format and

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,079
you have to give me the entire software

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
tool chain

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,399
in order to be able to run it again so

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
imagine this applied to something like

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
gmail

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,600
where google would have to hand you a

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,600
copy of all of google's infrastructure

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
to be able to run it

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
let's ignore whether or not that's

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
possible it's something interesting to

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,839
think about

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,639
uh anyone know why apple is moving from

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,959
bash to z

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
shell

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,040
it's licensing of course

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
uh apple's been shipping a really old

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,480
version of bash

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
john everyone knows fish is where it's

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
at

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
um apple's been shipping a really old

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,720
version of dash for a long time

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,560
because it's gpl v2 and newer versions

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,279
now use gpl v3

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
and z shell as opposed to bash uses an

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,320
mit-like license

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,680
plus some gpl shell functions

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,839
um if you read reese's blog

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,240
uh you you likely have seen this it's

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,639
from his balancing makers and takers

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,720
uh you know he comes from an academic

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
background and he did a ton of reading

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,920
on this and it's an amazing amazing

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,839
resource to go through

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
um and obviously he's got a ton of

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,160
experience in the situation he's at with

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
both

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,040
a company and an open source lead so i

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,600
want to say that web 3

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,519
is in fact also looking at this in a

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,399
much broader way

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
that common goods and public goods

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
shouldn't just be the data licenses but

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,959
some of the infrastructure that we're

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
talking about

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,880
so while we're still trying to figure

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
out how to get maintainers who work on

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,320
code and documentation and support or

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
other things supported

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,240
i'm actually going depending how you

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
think about it down another level and

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,959
saying

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,480
well shouldn't the internet and the

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,920
resources that run it

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,399
be much more open and commonly available

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
um because we we should move past

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,120
scarcity in a lot of these things

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,720
and and make it available for people um

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
who don't necessarily have all the same

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,240
resources

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,000
so this is where things get a little

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,240
awkward

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,240
web 2 web 2

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,839
is really still the advertising

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,519
supported web i think that's one of its

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
hallmarks it's one of the things that we

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,160
saw

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,560
um and we you know venkatesh rao um

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,519
uh wrote this article about the extended

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,959
internet universe

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
uh last may may 2019 uh and i think it's

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,079
pretty good

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,839
uh you can look around there's the dark

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,800
web and the deep state and

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
corporate uh cozy web we'll get to that

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
it's super cool

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
ad tech web old media that hasn't made

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,480
it online yet

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
um and people are offline uh and then

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
various

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,480
kind of national areas of infrastructure

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,880
so this main public internet that you

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
see

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,320
that's mainly the ad tech web um you

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
know

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,399
is users clicking on links on public

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,279
pages or apps maintained by publishers

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,320
and you're seeing those air quotes and

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,440
it

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,440
should be derogatory um we think a lot

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,600
maybe in cms land about publishing

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
and about users and pushing things into

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,679
eyeballs

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,120
but a lot of this stuff uh that's not

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,839
people actually want to be

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,640
so there's your reaction to that maggie

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,640
appleton

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
um kind of remixed uh venkatesh's post

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
along with another one by yante

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,760
strickler

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,439
where he wrote about the dark forest so

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
right now

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,760
um the web especially if you're browsing

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,799
it on a browser without adblocking

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,080
installed

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,160
is not really a great place uh

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,440
inhabited by data scavengers ad tech

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,080
marketers and trolls

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,799
enter with caution and i'd say that a

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
lot of things

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,400
that sites that drupal powers are part

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
of the problem

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
they'll be running a ton of different

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,559
tracking scripts

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,960
um and um you know you'll have to

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,679
decide for yourself which of those

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
things

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,360
maybe marketers is the is the least

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
defensive term on there if we're

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,559
wandering around the open web

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,280
but the cozy web works on this human

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,360
protocol

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,320
of everyone cutting and pasting bits of

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,919
text images urls and screenshots across

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
live streams uh so that was venkatesh

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,200
continued from the previous

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,960
slide and maggie says we create tiny

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
underground bros of slack channels

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
whatsapp groups discord chats and

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
telegram screens

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,520
that offer shelter and respite from the

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,039
aggressively public nature of facebook

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,640
twitter and every recruiter looking to

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,320
connect on linkedin

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
and i think that's super interesting

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
because of course drupal's routes are

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
uh as something that had a great

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
permission structure and membership and

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,039
profiles and

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,720
personalization very early on you can

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,400
run a completely private drupal site

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,960
where you have to log in

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,799
so i'd say that we can in fact power

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
bits and pieces that cozy web

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,799
in an interesting way but it's not what

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,320
people reach for today

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,840
because um they're uh using these other

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,840
systems that feel more fluid to them

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,520
so i'm going to give you a definition of

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,679
web3 to say where the heck

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
are we with web3 or the decentralized

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,960
web

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,120
um it's not quite settled yet it's kind

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,640
of in progress but i'm going to say that

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,480
in fact there is tech innovation here um

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
everything from cryptography and

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,080
distributed systems advances

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,360
um to legal and governance model

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,000
innovation aspects like the

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
cryptographic

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,679
autonomy license um governance as people

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
work

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,760
much more collaboratively or have

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,640
something like open collective where

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
everybody can run

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
a sort of an association-like system

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,240
without having to set it up

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,840
um i'd say number two is commons based

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
global infrastructure

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,840
so we don't really think about it but

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,880
right now we're paying a lot of

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,240
people to host stuff for us um and

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,240
it's really way too complex

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,559
what if more of that was available for

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520
anyone to host on top of without making

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,240
kind of a

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,799
faustian bargain with facebook or others

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
where their

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,320
user and their data is the product and

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
finally i think there's an ideology of

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,799
decentralization

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,240
which kind of stands for breaking free

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,799
of a bunch of these things and running

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
things more

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
independently user control of data and

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
identity

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,600
and yes money as well

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,880
business models beyond advertising and

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
we're seeing that with

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,400
paid newsletters you know it feels

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
really strange to see the upstream of

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
newsletters but that's just part of the

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,679
cozy web happening

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,159
so that's the promise

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
of some innovation on the cryptographic

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,200
technology i'm not really talking

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,360
blockchains i'm talking

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,440
public private key cryptography and

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
various other distributed systems

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,799
where the user can maintain control of

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,919
their identity and data

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,919
so right now as venkatesh says the

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,240
pre-crypto extended internet

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,080
you can pick any two of three you can be

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,760
free quality or open to the public but

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,640
you can't pick all three today

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,159
because it's simply too uh complex or

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,520
not enough of a business model to do

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,720
that

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,640
so meanwhile over

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
on drupal island and i've heard things

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,280
have gotten uh a ton better

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
um in this and and obviously even the

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
dress note this morning where he talked

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
about all the different third-party

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
systems

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,240
that are going to be looked at being uh

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
upgrade or or replaced with other

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,360
systems

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,600
drupal island is actually really nice

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
these days in in drupal 9 and drupal 10

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,360
coming up

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,720
you know with only a few pirates i still

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
love that bad camp level

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,080
it's amazing um so

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
one issue that i see is that drupal is

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,400
stuck on lamp island

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,000
um lamp we've been building

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,840
lamp stack uh linux apache mysql php

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,600
um for 30 years and

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,679
containers are kind of a progression of

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,159
that uh where we're just taking that

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,440
lamp stack and we're virtualizing it

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
um and and i think to get more decoupled

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
um

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
drupal needs to think about how it can

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
take more of its pieces apart and

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,400
and improve architecturally i think

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
decoupled drupal is part of that

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
serverless

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,960
uh is a thing um right now

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
a lot of times only being run by very

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,600
large global providers

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,880
which is a problem um and then

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,480
hostless is sort of a thing that i see

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
often the distance and it's a phrase

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
that that we use

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
uh for thinking about what you can do

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
with a decentralized web and

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,120
peer-to-peer

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,200
um and kind of take back that very

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,039
decent that very centralized version and

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,880
say everybody can be a client and

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,440
and serve things

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,480
come on the reason that i got involved

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:51,280
and i got really excited about drupal

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,520
is to democratize

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,480
putting information online in

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,960
communities of

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,159
people uh and it was a different time a

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
lot of the world was

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
was a lot of the developing world uh

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
africa southeast asia

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,840
was alert further reliant uh behind

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
wasn't really online anymore we're now

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,400
global

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,520
um self-hosting is too damn hard and

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
i don't mean you know people running

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,200
a little box under their desk over the

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
dsl line although that's how many of us

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
started

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,760
or as dries did in his dorm room of

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,640
stringing ethernet cables from dorm to

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
dorm

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,240
um i understand we have many more people

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,200
online and the architectures need to be

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,880
more scalable to support them all

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
but we've now made it too complex for

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,320
people to self-host from a security

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,360
perspective from a scalability

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,840
perspective

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,360
from a resource consumption perspective

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
you know i don't see a lot of

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,039
making drupal run on embedded devices

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
that was an actual thing

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,360
that i actually worked on to say we

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,000
should put drupal on routers

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,840
and have mesh networks and we can have

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,240
distributed wikis with drupal

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,520
and drupal's pretty damn heavyweight

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,679
yeah raspberry pi

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,039
exactly uh didn't exist at the time but

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
uh you know

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,039
like we these are things to think about

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
and these are part of diversity

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,760
inclusion

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,720
if you think about if only the people

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,880
who can pay for hosted services

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,799
we've we've just gotten stuck again or

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,400
you have a different middleman where

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,279
drupal hosting providers are the people

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
who are then

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,480
doing it and there's nothing wrong with

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,840
that that's a specialization layer but

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
it is something that we have to ask

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,799
ourselves

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,679
uh we started the memes so i have to add

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,559
more

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,520
um you know i really see docker as just

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,000
an expansion

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,000
of lamp uh rather than figuring out or

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,080
evolving architectures it's like well

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,600
just stick it in this box and maybe we

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,960
can decouple the database and a few

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
other things but

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,640
you know then we have this other big

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
orchestration problem and we have this

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,720
old category of devops

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,400
where someone who starts as a site

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
builder is now supposed to go all the

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,080
way

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,080
to getting a degree in docker no

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,640
too much um so there really are tons of

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,559
islands if we keep zoom out or zoom in

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,559
in different ways something i actually

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,640
wanted to mention is that some of these

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,760
islands are about privilege

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,919
and cultural bias um it

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,279
is something that i want to acknowledge

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,320
right so there were

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,080
uh um it's it's always something that

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,000
that drupal kind of had in its mind but

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,159
i looked around in the early days

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,799
and i mainly saw uh cis white men

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,559
young white men uh getting involved in

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,039
in open source and we're still not doing

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
great

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,080
and and i and i want to do more with

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,840
that i want to also see

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
more of the world coming along with

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
these sorts of things

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,120
so think about all the different islands

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,840
you're on in many ways triple is on

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,039
gpl v2 island with its early discussion

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
about licenses

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,559
you know dries recently mentioned um and

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
this is sort of a thing do you do you

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
think that

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,039
gplv2 is the very best license there

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,520
will ever be

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,400
no it turns out it's really hard to

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,159
re-license

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,559
but these are things that we want to

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,760
think about

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,200
and there's even http island

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,559
what the heck is boris on about now

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,559
so the biggest island is the web

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,840
even that's hard to define today if we

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,200
think about all the different angles

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,039
that it goes into

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
so if we think about a browser and what

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,120
it embeds it has

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,120
run times for html css and javascript

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,279
again the dressnote this morning with

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,679
php super interesting

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,600
not something that i had considered uh

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,039
has given me a whole other angle and

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,360
and you know we have to be careful not

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,480
to get dragged in by the new shiny a lot

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,279
of the time

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,520
but um you know the browser is this

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,799
amazing resource including on mobile

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,840
and what's coming is web assembly so web

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,240
assembly

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,320
is sort of a universal runtime you can

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
compile a number of different languages

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
so

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
instead of just javascript having to

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,080
build everything in javascript

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,520
and it being the main portable

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
programming language

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,640
uh you'll be able to take many other

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
different languages

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,799
i think it gets really interesting if

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,000
you start decoupling

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,159
drupal even more to think about what

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
pieces can you potentially process in

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,360
different areas what can you process

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,880
client-side what can you process in

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,279
a serverless style where you're

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
farming out various functions in in

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,840
different ways

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
uh so i'm really interested to see where

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
this goes and i'm following it very

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
closely and i think webassembly is going

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,039
to be

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,000
have a gigantic impact anyone remember

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
lynn clark

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
uh she was involved in in drupal did a

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,200
lot with

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,039
moving data in and out of drupal uh

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
she's actually working on webassembly uh

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,159
at mozilla right now so really excited

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
to

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,039
to see people from the drupal community

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,399
and where they end up

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,480
so islands we're stuck on them

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,279
we're constrained in them we have bias

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,480
that makes us not think outside of them

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,679
so but what if we had

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,360
common infrastructure or

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,760
more directly commons infrastructure

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,640
so snipping again from from teresa's

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,240
post

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,480
um uh these are the the the top line

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,799
common goods are rival risks

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,000
uh uh common goods so if you have a

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,600
fishing ground

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,559
if there's multiple fisher people um

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,120
they uh they they can't all get the same

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,120
amount

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,399
of fish they're in competition with each

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,080
other um

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,000
if we cut down trees there's only so

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,440
many trees to to cut down

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
um and that applies to some things

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,320
juice's example i think in part was um

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,320
was customers um you know people who

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,760
work on drupal or who sell drupal

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,640
well there is a finite pool there public

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,159
goods

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
are things like lighthouses you put a

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,080
lighthouse up the light shines

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,279
everywhere everybody can benefit from

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,039
the lighthouse

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,399
um and there's no you know

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,559
you you can have a million people

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,640
gathered around the lighthouse and

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
no one has less of an experience around

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
it um

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,520
and if we think about you know simple

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,640
scenarios if you're all sitting at home

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,440
on on zoom video on your multiple people

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,799
using the the tiny sip of uh of upstream

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,919
bandwidth

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,919
that's a common good that you're

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,720
connected to and it's rivalrous

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,520
um what what does it look like if we

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
start building

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,320
commons infrastructure why is everybody

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,559
deploying their own servers why is

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,880
everybody deploying their own cdns

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,919
why is everyone deploying their own copy

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,799
of that

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,520
uh javascript library um or other

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,919
aspects

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,520
can we share more can we can we actually

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,279
contribute to this more

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,559
um in interesting ways and really

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,039
the the case is that um i

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,440
i think that a lot of the under under uh

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,279
underlying cryptographic tech

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,240
means that we can re-architect some of

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,480
these things to build more of a commons

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,039
and get all three of these things

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,840
out of what a next web3 decentralized

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,960
internet

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,399
looks like so

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
we're going to do a quick survey of a

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,440
bunch of things happening in

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,600
decentralized web um

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,799
there's lots more to read into you can

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,480
see i'm actually already linking

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,360
directly to drupal modules with a bunch

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,919
of these things

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,120
drupal's super well known um hey can i

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,679
get a show of hands or

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,159
or hear hear who remembers the pants

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,159
module

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,640
i have to wait for my voice to go

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,919
through one two

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,520
three four five i remember pants

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,159
yes aaron we all remember pants um

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,600
so the pants module was uh was an

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,919
example module

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,520
and it ended up being you know there

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,200
would be a new release of a standard

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,320
saying that w3c had standardized

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,760
something or that

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,440
a big tech company had released

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,399
something and they'd released an api for

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,679
something

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,919
um and uh and you know

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,320
within 24 hours often there would be a

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,320
pants module interface

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,200
or an entirely new module that the

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,399
drupal community had put together

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,159
if you remember jabber or xmpp

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:13,679
um a a a standard chat protocol

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,880
um there was a a drupal pants plug-in

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,799
where you could set your pants status um

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,200
using xmpp yes a little juvenile but

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,039
you know generally non-denominational

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,320
lower body coverings

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,200
um of of all kinds um

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,000
so as is no surprise there's actually

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,360
lots of the stuff still

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,080
happening in drupal so activity pub

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,200
these things on the left are more webby

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,159
and are more

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,279
uh specs and standards and speed and and

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,440
and things like

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:50,880
rss feeds or or those types of xml specs

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,080
activity pub if you've heard of macedon

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,279
is an open spec from the w3c um

00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,000
to be able to um basically

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,080
federate so get decentralized and have

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,080
things like a federated twitter

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,519
uh or other messaging or blogging or

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,880
other things like that instead of having

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,399
to build them all together

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
it's a standard protocol where people

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,559
can either run their own

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
single instance for themselves self-host

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,840
or they can

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,399
join uh together with a group of people

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,720
that might run something as a commons

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,080
or a really big entity might run a giant

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,200
version of it but they're all using the

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
same protocol

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
which gives a lot of access as well as

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,919
in increasing

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,200
diversity uh and inclusion indie web is

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,799
another really great movement that i've

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,080
been spending a ton of time in and a ton

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,279
of stuff is happening

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,880
um micro pub is an open interface um

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,880
and again i'm pointing directly at the

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,120
at the drupal module like this is here

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,720
today and you can even try it today

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,720
on the other side is the stuff that's

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,799
built on cryptographic tech

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,720
and again we don't mean cryptocurrencies

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,120
and we don't mean bitcoin miners what we

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,159
mean

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,159
is cryptography um security

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
so when you see the lock in your browser

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
that is ssl

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,760
that's based on cryptographic principles

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
uh i see that if you slide into

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,120
drupal.org and you're working with git

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,640
you actually now have an ssh key that

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,240
is a cryptographic tech and it's

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,240
actually super interesting

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,799
because it now means that drupal

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,000
accounts have a cryptographic key

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,679
associated with them

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
with that building block you can do

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,799
really interesting things

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
uh terese mentions that swintel is

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,440
someone who did a bunch of work the

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,240
other one i'd like to do a call out for

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,799
is uh

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,120
nedjo someone who's been around i think

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,880
also since 2003 who i found when i did

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,000
some research for this

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,279
um so my company vision we're doing a

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,760
lot of work with ipfs

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,799
and in the 10 minutes i have remaining

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
i'm going to tell you a little bit more

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,480
about it

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,600
um and we worked on it on with affinity

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,799
bridge and putting together

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,960
an ipfs module um matrix

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,919
super interesting mozilla just switched

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,919
to it

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,960
so they closed down irc and they

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,480
switched to matrix

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,600
as their main um um asynchronous chat

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,919
protocol

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,200
i would highly encourage drupal to

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,720
follow their lead

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,240
um i think this is the kind of thing

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,120
that especially open source communities

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
should be

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,599
leading by example with uh i don't have

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,879
a link for secure scuttlebutt uh it's

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,679
the one that's kind of

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,760
least webby most cryptography most

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,320
decentralized and it's super fascinating

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,120
i'll tell you

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,520
about it a little bit later

00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,440
[Music]

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,040
and later is now so this is one of the

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
things i wanted to include

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,960
i feel like a lot of movements today are

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
getting an upgrade

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,599
in things like openness and inclusion

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,839
and i think that's fantastic

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,359
um with more people involved more people

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,200
are asking questions

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,960
and so diversity is getting built in

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,960
right from the technology decisions that

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,359
get made at the lowest levels

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
um and so this is the secure secure

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,960
shuttle but principles stack

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,520
we often show tech stacks in these

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,919
slides and this is a lovely lovely

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,280
uh stack of principles of the in these

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,760
various areas that they

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,440
that they look at um and i'll share

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,680
links to all of these things so that you

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
can dive into this in more detail

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
um very briefly uh so this is from my

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,079
friend uh rabble

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,960
um and um uh shows very briefly uh

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,280
underneath

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,359
uh every one of these usernames or

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,800
accounts or identities are linked to

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,720
by um a cryptographic key um

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,480
so you're passing these labels around

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,599
and you know exactly who they are so

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,640
once you've published something and

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,480
you've signed it

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,760
it means you don't have to be online and

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,359
other people

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,280
through cryptographic principles can

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,880
know that it was you and only you that

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:37,359
was published it which is pretty amazing

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,680
uh ipfs the interplanetary file system

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,480
so uh we're gonna keep going at

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,720
lightspeed

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,800
uh i gotta hit my timeline um so today

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,480
we work on location addressing an ip

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,040
address pointing to a server a web

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,800
server pointing to a directory path

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,720
example.comcat.jpeg content addressing

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,359
is every piece of content has a unique

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,560
hash making it location independent

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,359
that hash is a side effect of the actual

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,400
content itself meaning it's a unique

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,599
fingerprint

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,040
it means that it that jpeg doesn't need

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,280
to be served up by

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,359
your server just like the scuttlebot

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
example it can be served up from

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,280
anywhere it's available

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,040
including cache or offline from local

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,160
devices

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,960
so each file is giving this unique

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,200
fingerprint

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,800
and the blocks inside of it so some of

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,720
you may have experience with bittorrent

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,440
so in the same way it's kind of chunks

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,160
of file into blocks as does ipfs

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,320
and each one of those blocks of content

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,760
are uniquely identified

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,640
ipf ipfs removes duplications across the

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,119
network

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,160
so while there may be many copies of

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,079
cap.jpg

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
in general on the network it'll only

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,720
have one identity

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,400
and each of those blocks will be

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,119
distributed elsewhere as well but it

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,680
means

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
it only has to be stored once if you're

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,560
if you're caching it locally and it does

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,079
this automatically as part of the

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,920
protocol

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,760
so each node or server in the system or

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,040
peer

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,119
stores content um and also

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,280
a little bit of a cache of saying you

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,599
know who else in the network has what

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,880
and so when you look up a file with that

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,520
hash

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,800
you're asking the network who has

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,000
cat.jpeg now

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,359
if cap.jpg is gigantic

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,280
a really long cat then it'll actually

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,160
ask for blocks inside of it so

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,880
this shows you that if you are in a

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,760
local

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,839
cafe you might actually reach it from

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,640
other

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,000
computers directly on your local network

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
it doesn't even need to go out to the

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,160
open internet

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,720
which is why this also works offline

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,920
but once the blue nodes are identified

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,040
as having the content

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,599
that you're requesting then

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
all of them stream those blocks to you

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,040
again

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,079
like bittorrent bittorrent does this

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,119
kind of swarm

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,560
only once per file ipfs

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,440
does this for all files across

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,760
all nodes um uh have these blocks

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,119
available to them so swarming across

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,280
the entire commons network

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,560
um i think we're going to skip over this

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,599
relatively quickly to leave a little

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,599
more time

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,280
um because we've got hashes you can

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,440
actually do linked data that's built in

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,160
the protocol as well

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,240
so you can link from one hash to another

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,480
you can include both data so that's just

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,480
a string but it could also be a file

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,800
from another and this will look uh

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
pretty common like json objects

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
um and then you can do things like make

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,599
a query

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,480
using the cat command on the command

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,760
line to get things like saying

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,800
um you know the founder of this

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,359
uh uh company is brooke so you see the

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,680
hash

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,040
as well as human readable links inside

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,160
of it

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,920
so content addressing is the key thing

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,320
to take away from here that is amazing

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,119
it's an

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,040
interplanetary sized namespace the same

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,760
file equals the same hash

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,680
no matter when let's say you get offline

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,920
for ages and you have some content on a

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,359
usb stick and then you come back online

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,400
the hashes will still be valid and

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,520
they'll be the same

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,160
no matter where and no matter who so if

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,640
you're running

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,400
a node off of an old android phone in

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
the middle of africa that has no

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,560
cloud computing you can participate in

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,880
this global swarm

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,839
and lots of other things zero file

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,920
duplication

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,359
it's got cdn features built in it's got

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,320
immutable data structures

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,760
which are really amazing um and files

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,839
and data living together which is why i

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
did want to show you that linked data

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,040
so where do we go from here

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,760
i've given you kind of a tour

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
of a bunch of things that are happening

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
i believe there

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,040
is a transition happening it's happening

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,400
amongst people it's mapping with

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,760
societies it's happening among

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,359
communities and it's happening along

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,200
technology

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,599
drupal is built on 20 year old

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,760
principles and yet

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,440
come for the code stay for the community

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,720
it's done an amazing job of carrying

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,640
that community along

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,160
and i really look forward to re-engaging

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,760
with all of you on

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,000
making some of these new steps when i

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,160
look at things like decoupled

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
um in other aspects and looking at

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,520
saying uh we should probably do some

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,920
first class javascript

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,200
that's the right direction i encourage

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,680
you to keep moving

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,280
uh the drop is always moving you should

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
think about this as you have a fire on

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
your

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,240
butts i don't know if we do beeping on

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,280
here i think i beat myself

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,000
so i want people to

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,200
come along for this ride um ipfs is one

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
of the things that i think are super

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,240
interesting

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,319
um and it's a really great building

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,920
block for a bunch of things

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,640
um as is my tradition i i edited a few

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,280
things from this

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,400
this session uh after watching the

00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,760
streets note

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
so one of the things that's really hard

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,839
to do is hosting large videos files and

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,280
data sets as a small community without

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,800
paying a lot of money or without going

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,640
to something like vimeo

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,400
well if you have the entire community

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,359
contributing in hosting and supporting

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,599
those files

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,880
you can self-host those large videos

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,319
files and data sets

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,079
and know that they haven't been

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,520
corrupted um

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,960
or or altered in any way so managing

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,920
assets with drupal

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,680
in sort of a uh a digital asset

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
management way but instead of

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,200
just dealing with how drupal mainly

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,119
deals with things is this tightly

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,079
coupled local file system that it grew

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,560
up with

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,280
is managing them well who cares where

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,520
they are

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,720
you've got unique immutable hashes that

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,400
say that have

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,000
automatic versioning built in which is

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,000
pretty amazing and if you do a slight

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,400
edit to a large file

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,160
guess what block deduplication will mean

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,359
that you don't have to store two copies

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,440
of it

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,359
um take drupal offline what

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,640
yeah so there's a couple different

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,880
things that we could do with that

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,160
one is you could kind of like a caching

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,839
infrastructure you could

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,240
publish all of drupal um a drupal site

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,359
um you know in a way that it's

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,000
statically published

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,800
so no personalization for those bits but

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
in general

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,079
what would it look like in a decoupled

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,040
drupal to take its front end

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,960
offline so react already runs completely

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,680
client-side as does view

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,800
and using various web techniques like

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,440
service workers

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,480
and also ipfs you can actually have the

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,240
browser itself

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,960
start fetching things and mean you could

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,359
continue working and browsing content

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,079
um syncing and interacting with desktops

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,079
and mobile

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,119
you could use icloud you could use

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,119
dropbox

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,560
you could use google drive you could use

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,200
onedrive

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,560
or you could go free range and use an

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,280
open protocol

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,760
uh and actually use ipfs as that

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,520
cross-platform interchange

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,520
i think a big one is letting users own

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,440
their data right now if you have a bunch

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,760
of people sign onto a drupal site

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,119
you have to hope that the person hosting

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,560
it

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,480
doesn't look at data that's supposed to

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,920
be private that

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,280
they back it up and in general

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,240
maybe even do things like having an

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,640
export so

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,400
how could we use ipfs to essentially

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,040
have users bring their own data with

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,720
them

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,640
uh and carry and it means that we could

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,800
go from drupal site to drupal site

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,760
and the users could have the same

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,920
experience

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,280
while they carry their data with them

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,480
sounds a little bit like icloud and

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,319
using apps doesn't it

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,640
it's really kind of how users want it to

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,160
work so from the grease note

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,680
if you're going to distribute drupal

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,359
update updates

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,119
you might want to consider distributing

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,040
them over ipfs it would

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,160
it can potentially really help save on

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,240
bandwidth costs

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,880
and because everything has a unique hash

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
it means that you could be sure that you

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,480
got the

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,160
known good version of files and updates

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,680
without ever having to ask a central

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,160
server if that's correct

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,160
or not

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,160
the drupal ipfs model module available

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,720
today

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,839
a bunch of links you can go to that uh

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
other link that i posted at the

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,480
beginning

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
um you can use vision or you can run

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,920
your own ipfs node

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,760
it's a building block um a lot of the

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,839
core pieces of drupal need better

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,280
decoupling i actually wrote some notes i

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,560
think we probably need to integrate with

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,880
fly system

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,760
um instead which is more generic way to

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,160
have uh

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,119
have external file system um and i

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,520
really look forward

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,520
to seeing what people explore and and do

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,680
with this

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,560
so thank you very much um i would really

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,560
uh

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,800
appreciate it if you uh uh if you came

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,599
along and then did uh uh a session

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,079
review

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,079
uh slides are available and that uh talk

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,920
post is where all my stuff is

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,359
um yeah that link there that aaron

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,040
posted is there

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,040
yeah and and there's i think this is

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,680
really like uh this is a call to action

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,640
right

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,319
like we can do this by ourselves these

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
are these are not the big heavy building

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,480
blocks

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,240
of of uh of swapping out major pieces

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,160
drupal has a lot of these pieces in

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,920
place already we just need to make it a

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,560
priority for people to experiment and

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,560
play again

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,839
awesome i think i any any questions

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,040
i think i'm out of time i don't know if

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,040
they just yank me off stage

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,880
thank you ah

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
i wish i could could grab a beer with

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,880
you all a beer tower

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
greece i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,839
tweet the beer tower

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,839
so happy to take questions uh as long as

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,839
the session stays it stays open

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,599
yeah clayton i mean relevancy is you

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,560
know i had to go through the building

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,839
blocks so

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,839
technologists have to sit here and play

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,680
oh wow they let me in yeah are there any

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,599
specific

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,359
examples like the indie web for example

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,359
right it seems really

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,640
exciting but at the moment it's just

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,520
other people

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,079
talking about the indie web um are there

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,280
any like

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,760
specific examples of uh communities

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,319
using this stuff for so absolutely so so

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,680
indie web is a great example so micropub

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,440
is something that's really picking up

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,560
some steam and it's basically an

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,200
interface um in in

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,960
a standard way that apps can interface

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,720
to publish to any system so we used to

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,960
have meta web

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,000
meta weblog api that kind of went away

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,119
we now have micropub

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,440
and it's picking up steam so um

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,319
ia writer is a really popular ios and

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,560
mac app

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,240
that now has a micropub interface so my

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,960
call to action is if you have a drupal

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,760
site

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,720
install the indieweb module and do

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,520
things like hey

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,319
you can use a first class native

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400
interface

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,680
for writing posts and then you can push

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,119
them right

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,960
that's a really cool feature that makes

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,319
it like oh i didn't know i could use an

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,319
app to edit a web page

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,960
uh thanks no problem

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,839
david can i see david's question again

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,839
i'm scrolling up

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,160
i'll answer gerardo's question now

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,319
beyond decoupling a front-end bathroom

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,040
what other forms could we play with

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,480
so girardo there's a bunch of different

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,200
directions here so one of them

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,920
is that um i listened to a python

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,640
community and

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,040
really dries echoed this he's like you

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
know

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,960
we're we're planning for a decade so we

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,200
need to start

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,480
treating that seriously about uh all

00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,920
these different areas so

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,440
decoupling a front or backhand that's

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,400
exactly what i'm saying that's just the

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,280
beginning

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,720
so i would i would take grand challenges

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
what does it mean to run drupal

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,319
completely offline

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,559
what would you use it for why would you

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,119
care well for starters

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,800
there's no uh cloud infrastructure in

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,640
the entire continent of africa

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
technically there's an ibm one in south

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:25,040
africa which no one uses

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,040
um and

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:34,240
okay i'm looking at david uh i don't

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:37,760
think there was a question in there

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,400
yeah so i i think i think david

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,599
i agree with you which is why i've moved

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
on to other spaces

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,200
and and have have realized that as i

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,599
essentially failed

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,680
um in helping to democratize publishing

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,960
with drupal

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,680
because it's too hard to self-host

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,720
full stop so that's one reason the other

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,839
reason is that

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,800
everybody uses phones um so

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,720
how how can we have a phone participate

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,040
in a first-class citizen

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
um you know i want to say things like

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,599
okay let's go to the next step

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,520
can we run drupal on a phone

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,119
probably not but again what does it mean

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,599
to be drupal even

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,119
right we're more than just code we're a

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,119
community and that's what i want to see

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,079
yeah nejo has done a bunch of stuff in

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,119
this space

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,880
um and uh you know

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
very very interesting seeing a bunch of

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,040
themes coming up again so

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,720
could we collaborate together to make a

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,520
a d web

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,000
install profile as an example so you

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,079
know

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,160
drupal's biggest weakness is also it's

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,000
its greatest strength in that what the

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,119
heck does it do out of the box

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,640
so i think in many ways we weren't ready

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
early on to do that because there were a

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,480
lot of basics still missing when we're

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,680
taking on these bigger challenges

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,440
can we actually say okay we can create a

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,440
smaller group to build on all the the

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,400
great stuff that drupal already has and

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,160
tune it for some of these things yeah

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,000
exactly clayton indie webifying our

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,359
sites as agencies and freelancers as a

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,920
first step

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,359
experiment try it and then think about

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,520
the principles underneath

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,040
right what does pay it forward and work

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,839
together in a network actually mean in

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,839
this context

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:41,839
scrolling scrolling mind blown

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,839
thanks and

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:55,599
ruth the ice cream is from a really

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:59,040
great place in san francisco

00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,079
okay i guess we'll call that a wrap um

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:05,440
again really appreciate everyone

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,440
uh and um i'll be around

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,119
uh feel free to grab me in in chat

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,520
directly through my profile

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,240
um uh once i exit here i'll i'll

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,920
basically just

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,599
hang out and wait for that and i'll also

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,599
be in the

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,559
um drupalcon slack and i'm on twitter as

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,760
b-man

00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:27,119
um so love to connect with everyone and

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,119
love to see what we can do to get do

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,480
together

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,200
benjamin i think i think there's a lot

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,520
of a lot more cooperatives

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,960
um in the drupal space in the agency

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,640
space than there are in any other

00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,079
community that i'm aware of

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,400
so what does it mean for those

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,559
cooperatives to work together

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,839
and help form more cooperatives right i

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,240
think a lot of those challenges

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,079
especially 15 years ago international

00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,680
was just so hard and we have so many

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,160
more toolkits today

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,720
um and a lot more people eager for those

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,880
like

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,480
new forms of governance i see a ton of

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,640
people in the distributed web

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,960
trying to figure co-ops out from scratch

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,240
and i feel like there's a ton of um

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,640
drupal uh co-op agencies

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,440
um uh that that could have a lot to

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,359
share

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,559
um you know i want to see a lot more

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,280
open sourcing what

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,680
what does uh what does one one click

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:33,680
co-op creation look like from an actual

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:36,319
um uh structural perspective

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,720
um it's kevin your question about the

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,960
hash approach being file centric

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,520
it's not it's kind of block centric um

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,880
i'll actually paste a link in here

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,040
um so query is a system that's built

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,400
uh specifically on top of ipfs to handle

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,920
large file sets

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,599
and the problem that they were solving

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,319
is that these data sets

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,280
were too large for git and even git lfs

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,160
wasn't a very good

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,280
good choice when you're making only a

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,319
single row

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,000
let's say in a csv file change um and

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,480
query is something that's built on top

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,599
of that

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,359
um all open source as well

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,359
that lets you do that i'm really excited

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,440
actually about ipfs handling things and

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:18,000
working very closely with git

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,960
um so git lfs is a thing that happens

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,960
today

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,200
which ipfs can be used instead of

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,119
centralized repositories

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,920
and again the git hashes and ipfs hashes

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,599
are compatible i'm not actually a

00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,119
cryptographic expert but there's lots

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,240
more there there's the
