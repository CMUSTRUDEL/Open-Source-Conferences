all over europe and the us and then we

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
were in the very comfortable situation

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,439
of already having this set up before

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
all the restrictions came in place um

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
but i've just got a lot of learnings to

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
share i believe from

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
the time that we have working such a

having me on this panel very excited to

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,440
be with you

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,080
i am the ceo of platform.sh

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,320
platform message is a platformer service

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,160
focused on the developers

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,080
we developers build awesome applications

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
by focusing on their code

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
on the on the ui and feature set rather

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
than spending time to

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
try and figure out the complexity of

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,319
cloud

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
we thrive that uh attracting complexity

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
away

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
developers define the cloud architecture

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,360
they need and we magically

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,720
make it happen we launched the

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
business a little more than five years

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,520
ago it's almost

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,680
200 of us now at platform sh

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
and i think i like to think at least

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
that one of the best decisions we've

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
made

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,240
was to go distributed i'm fully remote

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,080
we made the decision a little shorter

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
than four years ago

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
we still have an office in paris so it's

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,400
somehow still a little bit hybrid but

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,520
really most of our teams really is

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
working from home

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,280
across the entire the entire world

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,520
and even though we you know our biggest

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,680
country is uh

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
is is is the u.s you know the company is

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,479
originated from

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
from france uh and uh 90 people in the

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,280
team

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,400
are actually based in the u.s today so

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
very good world setup

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,919
and again very excited to share the

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,160
learnings of that journey with you guys

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,440
today

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,479
thank you fred so i think um

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,319
we have here like platform message for

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,479
kitchens and amazing labs

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,199
which were kind of globally distributed

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
um and working with remote teams even

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,120
before

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,000
the covet started so i just wanted to

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,639
hear from you

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,759
ellia um why did you decide to go reward

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,880
four years back

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
and how have you managed to maintain the

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,520
culture of the

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,440
security and focus thank you for that

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,960
question that's a great question

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,960
um when i joined for kitchens we had

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,280
which was seven years ago we had just

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,759
hired our first remote team member

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
and over the course of a couple of years

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
our demographic

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,039
slowly shifted from mostly in office

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
with a few remote team members

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
to about 50 50 split between the office

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
and remote

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,599
and when we first started hiring uh

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
distributed team members we really had a

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,039
policy of

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,120
remote first which to us meant that if

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
one person was remote and calling into a

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,639
meeting then everyone

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
even those in the office would also take

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
that call from their desk

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,080
and this meant that we ended up adding

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
video conferencing to all of our meeting

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
invites because

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
you never know when somebody might need

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,840
to call in to a meeting

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,599
and not be in the office led to a lot of

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,199
flexibility for the folks who

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
were in the office as well as our

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,280
distributed team members

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,440
and it got to the point where i might go

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
in and i would be the only person in the

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
office

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,839
building that day um so

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
we had our lease coming up for renewal

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,640
and

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,560
i considered a lot of different options

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,959
of what to do like should we

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
get a smaller office get a co-working

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,360
space

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,800
shut down the office completely and

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
ultimately i just decided that

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,279
maintaining two different

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
cultures and models of work didn't

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,160
really

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
work for us it wasn't sustainable so in

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
order to best serve our people

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
we kind of had to to draw the line in

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,720
the sand and say either

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,560
we're all remote or we

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,680
make a completely different decision um

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,440
for us the and i think that i i'm

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,839
curious to hear what others have to say

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,440
about this the foundation of our culture

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,160
has remained strong throughout that

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,399
transition because that foundation was

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
already focused on things that make a

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
remote

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
workforce work well which is people and

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
trust

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
so whatever your culture is going to be

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
before going fully distributed it's

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
highly likely that it will be

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,880
after going distributed it's not like

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
those foundations change um

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
i do sometimes miss working in the

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,360
office obviously uh but

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,160
mainly because i truly enjoy the people

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,160
that we work with

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
as human beings and not just as like

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
work colleagues

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,040
and a lot of them i wouldn't even know

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
if we weren't a distributed team

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
so i'm grateful for the relationships

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
that we get to build

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,519
which are deeply connected even though

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,519
we aren't physically together

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,079
thank you and fred i know you started

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,040
platform as such as a 12-member

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,040
team and then grew to 198 members right

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,560
190 plus members so

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,120
and you've always been a a remote

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,720
company

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,640
so how did why what drove you to

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
like really make it remote right from

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,320
the beginning and what would you like to

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
share to some of us who are just trying

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
to figure

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,000
you know this new normal and saying like

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,399
yeah maybe this is also for us what

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,079
would you like to share with us

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
sure yeah i think you know just a little

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
bit like elia there's a lot of

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,880
similarities in the approach

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,640
uh i think you know the first uh the

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
first thing i'd like to say is we we've

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,519
always seen ourselves as a uh

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
as a global company uh even though when

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
we're

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,880
very small just a few of us we you know

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,880
we wanted to solve the problem that was

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
to us uh you know a problem for

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
developers without borders

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
uh we didn't see as the opportunity as

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
you know solving a problem for a

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
specific country wanted to be

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,839
truly global and so very naturally for

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
us you know we started recruiting people

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
in uh in different countries

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
also because we had customers in

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,360
different countries so it was very

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,160
natural for us to you know start hiring

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,079
people in

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
different countries and so probably that

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
was the first motivation

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
and you know when you start small you

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
hear you're one person you want

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,399
i mean obviously you're going to have

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,519
them working from home

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,440
so that's how we got started but but

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,880
frankly i think you know we still had an

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
office at the at the very beginning of

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
the company

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
actually in paris and all founders were

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
just

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
uh in the same office every day at the

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
very early days

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,120
you know we started five years and a

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,120
half ago and uh the first year and a

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
half were still in office

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
and quite frankly we were just not

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
successful in hiring

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
marrying the people we needed uh you

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,680
know we were actually we had

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
we had some people in paris with a few

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,320
people in san francisco as well

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
and these are major ups major tech hubs

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
and

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,839
when you're a small startup you don't

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
have a brand

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,320
uh you know you just struggle to attract

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
the talents you need to build

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
to build the product you want to build

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,079
and um

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
you know we decided to switch to uh

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,040
remotes

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,680
uh completely very quickly on because we

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,839
couldn't find the the right talent

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,720
if i if i do a quick fast forward uh

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,079
four years later

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
you know this is really the problem

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,680
we've sold with remote

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,200
last year alone in 2019 we hired 80

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,240
people

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
and to hire those those 80 people we had

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,360
14 000

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
resumes with the crew so the number of

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
applicants has been

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,839
really going to the roof because i think

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,800
remote is very attractive

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,600
and if you can accumulate you know a i

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
think we

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,399
we've got an attractive culture uh we

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
are building some really good stuff with

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
uh

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,720
you know very fancy technologies that

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
attract engineers

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,360
you combine that with um with remote

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,880
and i think you got a really nice

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,760
cocktail uh to be an attractive company

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
and uh i think that's actually you know

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,399
the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
the most attractive part in remote to me

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
is the airing

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
and the amazing pull you get access to

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,160
uh

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
through you know just not having a

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
geography criteria

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
in your search so to me that's the major

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,079
major

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,279
win it's just like this pool of talent

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,519
that is

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,720
out there and is available awesome

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,519
so um we had elia

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,920
more remote and fred's team is like not

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,480
just remote but also distributed

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,560
i think stephanie if i'm not wrong your

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
team is also fully distributed right you

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
said

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,760
taiwan and new zealand and would you

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,959
like to tell us how do you manage

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,320
to you know the organization culture

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,480
in this distributed team yes um

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,880
so we actually have a bit of a hybrid

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,880
form we have physical offices

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,199
um two of those but then also the

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,240
distributed team around the world

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,160
and first of all of course all the

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,240
processes and communication tools are

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
very important they need to work

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
people need to be able to reach out to

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,839
one another

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,440
instantly that's very important however

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
also what we do

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
hiring process is very thorough we make

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
sure every applicant meets

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
almost the entire team actually that

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,079
they really they're part of that culture

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,000
already

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,920
we send out culture codes and

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
i also make sure though that people get

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
to see one another once or twice a year

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,399
it could be a conferences

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,199
um it can be that teams meet up

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
um based on a continent for example or

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
um

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
just about two and a half years ago i

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,440
came up with a holiday season

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,120
week and we fly everyone to switzerland

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,120
usually and just spend some times in the

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,560
mountains and for me

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,839
having this mixture of everyone knows

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,360
everyone and has met them once or twice

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,120
throughout the year

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,199
and then at the same time we just have

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,959
this very close interaction with social

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,440
stand-ups daily

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,959
it feels like a tight-knit group so

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
that's how we maintain our culture

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,839
and uh i mean i mean so good to hear

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
these different perspective ellia said

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
about how

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,240
you know i mean people and trust and

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,399
those foundations don't really change

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
you know and if these foundations are

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
strong then

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,759
moving into the the new remote mode is

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,560
much easier and

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
um the way you are making sure stephanie

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
to be available

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,720
right i think that's a really important

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
aspect

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
especially when we are tackling

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
different time zones i mean to be able

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,920
to sit up at 7 00 am did you say that

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,920
in your home

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,120
ready to start work and you know just

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
being available for them

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,279
so those are amazing thoughts uh

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
and that you've shared with us i know

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,079
teresa

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,480
peter duty was not like a fully remote

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,120
or distributed organization

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
more about 20 to 80 is what you told me

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
so

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,680
would you think there's something in

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
this new normal

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,720
in this cobit that's being fully remote

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,680
what is it that you would take forward

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
would you guys switch over to the new

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
mode

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
all together or what are the learnings

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
from this

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,320
uh i mean this switch from uh

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,040
like partly um you know

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
20 percent remote and to a fully remote

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
setup what are you learning so what do

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
you think would stay even after the

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,320
pandemic as part of patriotism

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,959
sure so you're right it's uh it was 20

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
previous free coved that were working

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,839
remote

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
and then 80 of our staff were somewhere

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
in the world in an

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,279
office and so we've had a lot of

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,040
learnings i think

00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,079
we went uh remote 100 remote on march

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,839
uh 10th and from that day one of the

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,519
first things that we got back from our

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
employees in particular from the ones

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,199
who were in the office

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,280
was this overwhelming sense of empathy

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
for everyone who was remote it was like

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,120
everyone's eyes were open to

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,760
okay so this is what it's like to work

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,600
from home it's hard to set a routine

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,520
it's hard to distinguish what is work

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,679
what is personal time

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,880
uh the need for breaks in between

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,160
meetings and so

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,799
that that empathy helped everyone to say

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
okay

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
let's let's make sure that we can offer

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,840
a better experience for remote

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,320
folks and that's something that we're

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,559
going to want to translate even after

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
there are opportunities to go back into

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,400
an office

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,559
we also recognized a lot about our

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
meeting culture and our protocols around

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
meeting that

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
if you were the minority who was remote

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
and you were in a meeting with a group

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
of people who were physically

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
in an office it was not the greatest

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,640
experience

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
uh sometimes there were audio issues or

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
it was hard to

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,320
interject into a conversation where the

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,400
majority of people were in a meeting

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,240
and so what we found is uh i think

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
someone mentioned this earlier that

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
when everybody's at that tile on a

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,799
screen and we're all using zoom

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,720
it really does democratize the meeting

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,200
and so i think that's also something

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
that

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,280
even when we go back we won't want to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
lose that everybody has

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,520
the same opportunity to participate

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
whether it's raising your hand in zoom

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
or adding something to a chat

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,200
but we're on an equal footing in our

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,240
ability to contribute to the

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,080
conversation

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,640
and so we don't want to take that away

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,200
we want everyone to still have that same

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,720
opportunity once we do have folks going

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
back into the office

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,160
and i think the final thing we learned

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
is

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,000
how quickly we could move from in

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,360
physical to virtual

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,880
and so it seemed like overnight our

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,679
new hire process uh was converted to

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
virtual

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,240
we could touchlessly onboard someone we

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,880
have a new hire uh

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
new hire training learning and develop

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,440
development which

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,679
also all went virtual uh pagerduty has

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
uh won the the one percent pledge and so

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,160
we give back to

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,880
our community in stock in product and in

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
time

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,760
and we had planned a volunteer week

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,919
which again in may went 100 virtual

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,200
and so these are opportunities that

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
previously would have been very

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
different

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,280
for an in-office person and a remote

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,360
person and now

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
all of a sudden we're trying we're it's

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,559
really an equalizer and we're we're

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
looking for ways that we can offer the

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
same

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,360
experiences for everyone whether they're

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,760
remote or they're in office and so

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,600
i think and not to mention all of the

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,559
marketing events that went virtual

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,760
and a hack week that also uh was done

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,520
fully remote

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
um so those are the things that we're

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,679
going to want to keep even after it's

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,799
safe to go back

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,320
if i may bounce back on what uh

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,760
both terrazzo and stephanie has said i

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
think what's very very special about

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,760
this period today is the fact that

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,159
you know we're remote but remote doesn't

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,840
mean uh not seeing each other

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
uh you know i think we all have some

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,039
sort of hybrid

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,720
mix where you know we get to see each

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,000
other we got to spend time together

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,840
physically

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
and what's really special about you know

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
this discovery period is that

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,760
that's not something that can happen

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,679
today and uh it's raised a lot of share

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
of challenges that even the companies

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
like you know

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
last year which which have already

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,799
experiences

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
having people uh in different locations

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,280
uh

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,240
is that you know we couldn't see each

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,120
other we had to do

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
everything in digital and this is uh you

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,200
know this is probably not the way i

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
want to drive the company myself i want

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
to see people

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,520
from time to time i want to find

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,679
opportunities like stephanie to actually

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,200
bring people in the apps or in the

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,799
mountains wherever

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,159
uh to just uh you know have an

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,159
experience all together a social

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,000
experience uh just working

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,600
from home all the time i think doesn't

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
work and so that's uh

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
that's what's so special about these

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,919
times and we're all learning a lot but

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
uh how to properly do that without any

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,720
contact at all

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
that's i think where the challenge is

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,960
the most

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
the strongest

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,840
and teresa i could really relate to some

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
of the aspects you were saying in terms

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,440
of empathy

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
right i mean for many uh who have just

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,280
voted to remote and not

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,159
really had an experience into meeting

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,000
taking meetings remotely being

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,840
anticipated to them in fact in some of

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,520
our meetings we even encourage them to

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,640
bring their kids to the meetings

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
i mean because the employees were in

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
meetings almost all through the day

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,320
so i mean it's only fair that you also

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,400
just embrace the family as part of the

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,159
it's okay i could really relate to many

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,520
of the things you shared teresa thank

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,400
you so much

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,919
and um fred there's a question for you

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
from the audience i want to just take

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,799
that in before we go to

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,720
uh our next dimension uh

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,960
they're asking have you had experience

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,679
of recruiting and training juniors or

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,080
accepting internships remotely would you

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,840
like to answer that

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,919
that is actually a really good question

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,360
uh you know it's actually i think very

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
easy to onboard people that have got

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,159
experience

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,080
in general into remote teams uh

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
if they have experience uh not only

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
working but uh

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,960
but also working remote it's even easier

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,000
uh now for

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,080
for new um for for new employees

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,159
that are you know fresh out of college

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
uh this is so much harder and uh

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,280
because they need much more training

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,039
they also need to

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,480
uh at the beginning of their career it's

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,000
always good for you know for those

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
people fresh out of college to be able

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
to be inspired by their

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,280
by their peers and obviously this is

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,400
something that you you don't get to have

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,440
so much

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
uh in uh in remote so we we uh at

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,760
platform message we

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,720
make exceptions uh that's actually why

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,760
we still have an office in paris

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,320
all the young uh trainees and uh also in

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,480
um

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,640
in cells you know get uh what's called

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,200
sdrs uh sdrs or sales

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,559
development representatives uh these uh

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,480
populations are must be

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
uh you know very young fresher of

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
college type of

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,480
of people though those people would

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,240
actually work in an office

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
or they would actually be mentored by

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,559
one specific person

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
and they would form a ago with that

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,080
specific person

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,640
as as a default setup uh because again

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
i think you know remote works very well

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
for

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,280
uh people with experience you know the

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
average age at platform message is 37

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
years old

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,159
if you compare that to the regular

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
startup where it's more you know it's

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,919
more

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,880
25 it's it's 12 years more right so you

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
know we

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,960
we get to um you know i think there's a

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
natural trend in remote and these real

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
teams it's

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,679
to get people with a little bit more

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
experience than than you would find in

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,039
in

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,640
typical startups uh so you you

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,240
absolutely need a specific setup for the

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
year for the youngs because you know

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
not having any any fresh out of college

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,600
people

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,919
for companies like ours would be such a

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,240
shame so you have to be specific

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,200
on dedicated programs for us for those

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,200
specific populations

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,120
thanks for that you said you had 30

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,360
interns

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,080
right you want to just talk about how

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,039
you went about on boarding them

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,120
sure so so pagerduty has had a career

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,039
accelerator program our cap program for

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
interns for a number of years

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,120
and we typically have between 20 and 35

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,000
interns any given

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,760
uh work term and over the summer we just

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,320
before covid we had already made offers

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
to

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,720
roughly 30 interns and we chose to

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,600
continue to bring those folks on board

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,200
and to work remote and so it was really

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,400
a combination of

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,559
uh giving more tools to the hiring

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,559
managers and making it clear

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,799
the importance of communication and

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,080
buddies to help those interns get up to

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,640
speed more quickly

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,600
and feel connected and then in addition

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
to that

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,720
the manager of the cap program put some

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
socials together for the interns

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
typically when they're in the office

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
they get to know each other and share

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,120
their experiences and so we didn't want

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
to lose that experience

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,559
and so we also bring them together

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,520
virtually

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,000
uh today still whether it's with a game

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,480
or

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,840
uh some kind of an activity where they

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,240
can get to know each other

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,000
and have more than one point of contact

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
than just the person that is mentoring

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
them so

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,960
um it is something we'll we again we you

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,279
know opened our eyes and and we can

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,320
continue to do this as we go forward

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,000
um to fred's point in an ideal world

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,600
many of those folks would love to be in

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,919
the office along with some of the

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
demographic that are in their 20s and so

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
we're not going to get rid of our

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,000
offices but we will try to make sure

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
that

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,440
that we can balance as we need

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
so just going to move on to the next

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
question um

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
which is more towards you know how do

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,880
you encourage

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,320
physical and mental well-being

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
especially i mean

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,200
this is not like a typical remote

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,200
scenario right i mean it's not just

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,679
being remote but it's also about just

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,679
hearing all this news about your friends

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,520
and uh a lot of a lot of our

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,080
employees are in areas which are

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,799
probably affected by covet

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,159
more than some others and uh some of

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,919
them are really stressed about their

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,039
families and friends

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,960
so um physical and mental well-being

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,720
and these conversations are something

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,159
that's uh

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,600
every organization is

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,559
trying to really make sure they are

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
keeping it in their minds so elia would

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,840
you like to share with us what

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,279
um you would recommend and what are the

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,679
steps you're doing

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,679
towards these directions

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,919
i think you know when when you were

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
asking the question

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
the first thing that came to my mind was

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,919
something that teresa said which is

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,960
communication um especially

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,400
in a remote environment you have to over

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,919
communicate uh whether that's

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,279
your own personal needs um or

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,080
asking what somebody needs um

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,960
unlike an office where you could go in

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,720
and see that somebody's having a bad day

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,600
um by based on body language um

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,399
you can't see that so you have to just

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
ask people like

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,880
how are you what do you need how are

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,159
things going with

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,520
your family member who's waiting on

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
their covid test

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,760
um you know i think that that's that's

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,399
the biggest thing for me

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,159
and one thing that that has been

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,159
important for us this year

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
has been just encouraging people to take

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,240
time off and

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,919
obviously in the u.s there's not a lot

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,720
of opportunities for travel

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,559
right now so people are hesitant to take

00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,279
vacation time because they're not going

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,080
to like

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,440
use it for something that they feel is

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,840
worthwhile

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,520
um but it's still really necessary to

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,799
unplug from your computer

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,159
unplug from the day to day at work

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,000
and take some time out of your house

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,679
even you know go for a long walk

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
somewhere um

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,279
just don't focus on email and slack and

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,320
all the things

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,960
um because it's it's a lot to

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
to bear just everything at work and then

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,399
the heightened

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,399
uh senses outside of work as well

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,559
stephanie you want to add on to this um

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,039
yes so alia you said it correctly it's

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,039
it's

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,960
really paying attention to people the

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,000
social stand-ups they behave differently

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,559
is it

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,159
do we have to ask you know hey something

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,039
up can we help you

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,480
um furthermore we've also increased our

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,960
in social

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
um exchange so we did quiz nights for

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,039
example

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,880
um those are always fun and also have

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,440
this or continue this interaction

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,799
throughout uh throughout the lockdown

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,120
times

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,799
um what i always do

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,399
i've done this previously but i just

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,120
really upped the communication

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,640
um during the code breakout in europe

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,399
that was actually what hit us

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,600
the most um being very transparent with

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,200
the state of the company

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,559
so when for example someone who came up

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
to me and said hey stephanie i feel

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,640
insecure about my job

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,000
and of course i couldn't promise them

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
that it's going to be safe forever

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,159
because that's just not true

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,520
but what i do is i inform my team on

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
monthly basis

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,000
where we stand financially i also inform

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,360
them or have them in any project jobs

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,039
stop sorry um where do we stand out

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,000
and they all know that i'll do my best

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,520
and the entire

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
team does their best that we get through

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,120
that situation as good as possible

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,240
and i'm very very lucky that not only

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,919
the managers that i've

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,760
briefed accordingly but all our team

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,840
members

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,760
it's really the team that comes up and

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,840
you know when they notice someone's not

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,360
themselves sort of struggling a bit that

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,559
they reach out that they help that they

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,480
support

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,799
and there are a lot of good measures how

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
we can additionally support that as a

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,840
company flexing flexible working time

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,240
for example

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,600
conversations with um our hr team member

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,320
things like that thank you so much

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,520
fred anything at platform sh that you

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,279
would like to share with us

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,960
sure yeah no i think you know the best

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,919
the best news out there is that we have

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,760
july 15th today and we're almost halfway

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,200
through this crappy year

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,360
uh it's been such a challenging one that

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,440
you know it's been so much stress across

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,159
the board for everybody you know between

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,480
being sick and getting realities being

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,799
you know

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,520
being sick themselves losing your job i

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,840
mean there's been

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,720
concerns and fear all over the place and

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,840
i think you know the

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,399
the key words and i can only uh conquer

00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
to what

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,159
elia and stephanie has said you know i

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,679
think it's all about communicating

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,200
transparently and what's going on i

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,880
think that's actually

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,559
the number one thing that is expected

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,799
from the uh from the leader of the

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
of the company it's uh it's transparent

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,039
communication

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
i also think it's empathy uh i think the

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,279
least we can do is you know

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,480
not add stress additional stress to our

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,880
employees to get enough

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,159
to do it and i think we need to uh

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,799
empathy is really at the

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,000
at the core of of what we need to do i

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,760
think you know it's all about

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,559
making sure that they understand that

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,440
the uh the work environment they

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,000
live in is actually safe it's a good

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
place for them to go

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
since everything has moved to 100

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,640
digital i think it's also

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,080
making sure that you know you feel you

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
feel you can ask stupid questions on

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
slack and not being judged

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,440
uh you know there's actually there's

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
nothing such as a stupid question by the

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,080
way

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,159
uh you you must feel that you're not

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,760
going to be judged you can make mistakes

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,159
i think all of those things are really

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,120
really critical to to make uh

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
you know a uh a a positive life

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,360
environment for your

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,519
your uh employees and and

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,039
collaborators and i think that's really

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,360
what uh what we

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,240
seos can be focused on today i think

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
just uh

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,679
making sure that the second half of the

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,720
year is uh is going through as

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,159
as quickly as possibly can be and

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,039
and you know with that extra damage

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,039
enough has been done

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,720
anything on the physical and mental

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,080
well-being that

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,080
page of duty is doing differently

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,279
i i think just to add on what's already

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,600
been said because the

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,919
the point about flexibility and empathy

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,120
is definitely something we're also doing

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,200
we're also trying to uh make make better

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,799
time use around meeting effectiveness

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,200
and so we've tried to

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,880
work with 25 and 50 minute meetings so

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,880
that people can get that break

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,039
ensure that everybody has a purpose and

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,200
an agenda for a meeting and

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,799
really allow people to decide do they

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
need to be at that meeting or

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,960
can they free up some time we're also

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
experimenting with

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
no internal meetings on wednesdays so

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,279
that external focusing

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,960
sales forces or marketing folks partner

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,760
relationships they can focus on their

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
customers

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,279
and other people can really have

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,640
dedicated focused time because it is

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,399
very disruptive when you're always

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
looking at slack and zoom so

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,840
we'll continue to experiment with things

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
like that we've also

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,279
tried to increase the number of

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,960
opportunities for wellness

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
so we brought on a mental health

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
platform that's available to all

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,279
employees

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,000
yoga instructors guided meditation one

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,159
of our employees

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
runs an art session where adults and

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,159
kids can participate

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
uh anything fun zoom contest trivia

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
contest so

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,399
anything to help distract and i think

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,200
what's really

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,200
important whether it's around pto or

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
just the behaviors and the openness is

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
that

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,679
we ask our leaders to model the behavior

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,080
that we want and to be vulnerable

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,240
to be to be the ones who can say you

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,640
know i am having a tough day today

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,720
uh and so hopefully letting other people

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,159
know that it's okay to have enough

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,320
to have a tough day to need to flex your

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,200
schedule or perhaps to need to take time

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
off

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,720
so uh those are those are things that we

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,599
would add to everything that

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,760
everyone else has also mentioned thank

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,599
you i think this is all such wonderful

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,960
ideas starting with

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,839
you know ensuring employees take breaks

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
to being empathetic over communicating

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,159
and some of the

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,480
uh fascinating ideas to distress from

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,520
teresa so thank you all

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,320
um moving on to the next

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,520
question this is special fred and

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,079
stephanie

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,440
um you know for those of you in global

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,040
offices

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,919
um how do you manage your teams from

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,919
different regions

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
stephanie want to go for that i mean

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,960
sure

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,240
um so basically since zurich in

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
switzerland is my base

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,680
of course the zurich team gets to see me

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,040
most

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,400
but i very much try to divide my t

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
and my time evenly for the different

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,240
teams

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,160
i make sure to visit not only the

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,839
swiss morning stand up but the one in

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,480
the afternoon as well for the us team

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,400
members

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,320
so that everyone gets to see me every

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,040
day

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,280
we also have the same support and

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,720
benefits structure around the world

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,760
so it doesn't really matter where you're

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,920
from you you get the same package

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,680
um and what i also do

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,440
um i was telling you before we started

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,000
this session um

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,480
i have breakfast meetings with our team

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,520
members from new zealand and australia

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,359
and so i always tell them i don't mind

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,880
to get up very early but they just have

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
to put up with me looking really

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,200
crumpled

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,839
and i'm just in my hoodie um

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,359
and i was very lucky to experience the

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,520
same flexibility with

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,800
other team members in other time zones

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,760
and with that

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,119
um yeah we can make sure that we talk

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
and see one another

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,280
um actually a very frequent on a

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
frequent basis and then the world

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,359
doesn't feel that

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,800
that big anymore so you don't meet once

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,000
or twice a year is that right

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,680
also yes yes we also do that so i

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,160
for example i travel to the k-town

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,079
office or go to conferences

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,280
there's actually one person in the team

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,200
that i haven't

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,800
yet met from the us i would have done

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,800
that in minneapolis

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,200
um for me it's i always try to

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
have a personal conversation with with

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,880
every team member

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
um to four memories outside of the work

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
environment

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,119
so for example i once sat four hours in

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,079
front of franklin's

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,800
in austin waiting for barbecue um and

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,040
just

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,240
by you know making the effort to getting

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,320
to know people around the world

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,680
that's not restricted to one country i

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,320
make sure that this happens

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
around the globe

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,119
do you want to add on to that i mean i

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
think the same as stephanie i think you

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,119
know

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,720
this is probably as you know on a

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,040
personal note this is probably one of

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,960
the things i'm the most uh proud of

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,240
uh at platform message we got 37

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,359
different nationalities

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,359
in the team and that's a huge diversity

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,960
uh you know we get people from from

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,240
basically all over the place

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,400
and this is extremely exciting uh

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
we actually decided to organize the

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,440
company not such as a

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,560
we don't have geographic organizations

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,960
all teams have team members from

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,160
from basically everywhere anywhere and

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,000
so uh you know

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,520
a uh we've got what we call initially

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,480
teams for instance in the engineering

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
teams

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,520
they work on specific part of the

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,119
product and

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,800
they can compose with you know a

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,680
designer from australia

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,480
two back-end developers one in the us

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,760
one in europe

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,240
and a project manager uh in canada and

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,119
uh

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,680
and so you know this works actually

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
really well

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,359
the only thing that i was i was joking

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,960
with the panelists earlier that's

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,800
that the one thing we haven't cracked is

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,800
the time differences and

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,160
this is the uh this is actually very

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
challenging for

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,839
for for all of us uh it's part of what

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
we do you know we accept

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
sometimes i wake up early and uh and and

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,880
work a little late

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,920
at night uh and try to make a break

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,079
you know during the day adapt the uh the

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,079
working hours because of that setup

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,520
i think it's so much worthwhile uh i

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
wouldn't trade that against anything i

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,280
think you know

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,680
the the impact of having such diversity

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,200
in the team is so high that you know

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,119
i would completely accept to continue

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,880
doing that for for years and i think the

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,880
team members feel the same and so

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,320
i you know i've never heard anyone tell

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
me

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,359
let's stop with that setup because you

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,560
know everybody sees the value and the

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,920
richness that

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,920
you know that that brings to the company

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,920
so um i think we're just kind of uh

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,160
in the last few minutes but there's this

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,640
really brilliant question

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,800
and i'm going to ask elia to answer this

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,480
for us

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,680
what suggestions do you have for your

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,839
employees to create a workspace at home

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,119
how do you draw the boundaries between

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,760
you know i mean

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,359
uh family and home how should you set

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,520
boundaries and so that they don't

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,440
interrupt you when your physical

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,440
presence are available and i mean just

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,720
bring that balance between work and home

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,839
right

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,040
especially with kids going to school and

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,119
doing their online school and uh um

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,960
both both the partners are working at

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,280
home so elia could you just give us like

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
a

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,720
quick answer for that i thought that

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,119
question is really nice

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,079
sure uh full disclosure i don't have

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,359
kids at home

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,720
so i'm think i'm one of the lucky ones

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,119
in covid lockdown right now um

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,240
but i i do work with a lot of people who

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,440
have kids at home

00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,160
um and i think that

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,839
the the boundaries go both ways i think

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,520
that you have to communicate with your

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,720
family

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,200
what you need um i for example

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,079
i'm at home with my partner who also is

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,680
working from home

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,000
right now and we both have offices with

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,960
doors on them which is very lucky so

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,920
right now

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,599
my office door is closed and that very

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,560
much communicates that you know

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,359
i'm busy and not to be bothered but if

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,200
it's open

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,960
then you know feel free to like swing by

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,800
and say hello um

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,800
so it i think that those kinds of

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,839
boundaries are important

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,440
um but the same goes for

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,440
making boundaries at work a lot of folks

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,040
who don't normally have young kids at

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,640
home have

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,119
young kids with them 24 7 right now

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,680
and i've just been asking them to be

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,839
clear

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,119
and communicative and transparent about

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,599
their availability

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,280
even if it means blocking off large

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,480
chunks of time on their calendars

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,200
throughout the week

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,880
um you know get your work done when

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,640
you're going to get it done

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,240
communicate when you're available to the

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,560
team so that they don't just think that

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,079
you've

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,599
ghosted them but this is just a reality

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,000
that we're living in so

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,599
i think that it depends on your family

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,760
dynamics and like what

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,800
tools you have available to you not

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,880
everybody has an

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
office with a door that they can close

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
um

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
so i think it's just about communication

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,560
and boundaries

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,640
for folks who are not uh experiencing

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,079
those trials and tribulations who are

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,520
just maybe getting set up

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,359
at home in general um i've been looking

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,680
at the stage chat and a few

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,400
things that i absolutely agree with have

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,880
popped up

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
um some folks have said that they have

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,640
separate

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,720
laptops for work and personal i don't go

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,119
that far but i do have separate logins

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,000
on my computer so at the end of the day

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,800
i log out of my work profile and if i

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,680
need to

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,119
get back online to you know check my

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,040
personal email

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,480
scroll on facebook whatever it is that

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,319
you're doing um

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
i log into that personal account so that

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,000
i'm not distracted by any

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,079
other slack pings or emails that might

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,240
be coming in so that's definitely

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,400
i think step one in creating strong

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,640
boundaries um

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,440
if you do have the ability to create an

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
office

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
space that's not in your bedroom it's

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,240
great for your mental health

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,040
um being able to to go to a different

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,480
room

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,960
and you know go to work uh that that was

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,720
definitely

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,800
important to me when we closed our

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,960
office and i was creating my workspace

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,800
i have two monitors a webcam

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,160
my headset you know just invest in good

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
tools because

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,480
you spend you know a third of your

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,920
waking life

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,599
at work so um make it comfortable and

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
and make it a workspace that inspires

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,640
you to do great work that's my tips

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,280
awesome thank you so much all of you for

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,280
jumping into this panel and i think

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
some of the top ideas for me is like

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,680
people trust

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,680
empathy over communicate and

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,280
like fred said let's watch out for the

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,400
next quarter that's going to be much

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,240
brighter and

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,440
we're just going to be out of all these

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,079
uh you know

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,720
yes yes thank you guys thank you

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,119
