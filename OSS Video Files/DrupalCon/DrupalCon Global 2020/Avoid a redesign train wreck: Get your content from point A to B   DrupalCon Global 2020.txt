minnesota also if you don't see

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,720
me on linkedin as well um but this talk

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
is all about avoiding

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
the problems and the roadblocks you hit

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
from getting content from a to b

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
um i wish i could see you guys all in

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,599
person uh i'm from minneapolis so

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
it would have been great to you know

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
bring you here and see you but hopefully

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,520
you're safe and happy

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
and enjoying maybe a cocktail while you

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
watch this which we could never do in

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
person

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,079
so um again my name is lynn winter i'm a

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
digital strategist

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,600
i'm a freelancer so for about three

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
years now i've worked with different

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
agencies

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
across the country doing user experience

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
content strategy

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,399
on information architecture i also do

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
some project management consulting and i

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,120
run a conference for project managers

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
which is now

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,359
online as it would be happening um in

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
august so if you're a digital project

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
manager you might want to check out

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,880
manage digital that might be

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
a good fit for you um as we go along

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,920
guys

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
uh i will probably not be likely able to

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,200
follow the chat but we will have about

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,720
10 minutes at the end for questions and

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
if we run out of time

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560
feel free to ping me after that um so

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,479
here's just a couple of pictures of all

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,000
the fun things we did the last year i

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,439
always include these on slides and i'm

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
like oh what have we done

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
since say march well we got a dog we got

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,680
a dog named moose

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
he's the boston terrier uh we haven't

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
let him figure out how to walk

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
downstairs yet

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
and so he's kind of trapped in the house

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
but i did what any respectable human

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
would do and started the instagram

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,720
account for

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
him so if you're in that kind of thing

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
um that's what our life is mostly about

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
work children

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,479
and moose these days um

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
so let's just get on the same page about

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,720
what content strategy

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
is before we get started um it's the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
means like this is my favorite

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
definition there's a lot but essentially

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
getting the right content to the right

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
people at the right time

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
in the right place um and that kind of

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,640
breaks down to being

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,399
substance the content structure you know

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,239
the pieces and the components of it the

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
workflow of getting the content

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
through with the process with people and

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,879
then the governance of that

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
and so that's kind of you know that's

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,160
when you are building a content strategy

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,319
that's what we're talking about

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
but it turns out this is not a talk

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
about content strategy

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
well not really right this is the talk

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
about

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
the point of when we go from this train

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
station to that train station

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,120
and all those things that throw us off

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,879
the tracks um

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
and we want to mitigate those

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
essentially so that we can get our best

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
work done

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
we get done on time um and we get to the

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
end

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
right and on budget so that's what we're

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,800
gonna talk about and there's five areas

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
that i've kind of found in my work

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
that are the problem areas that you

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
might be experiencing

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
so the first one is the ecosystem like

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
the quantity and size and dealing with

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
that

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,319
the next one is around content and it

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
being

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,680
user centric managing the internal

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
politics right

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,920
always the fun thing um what do we do

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
with people that aren't writers

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
how can we make sure that they are

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
provided tools and

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
establishing a process to get from a to

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
b

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,959
um so we're going to jump into all five

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
of those i apologize in advance i like

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
to talk really fast

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
so i'm going to run with it and then

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,959
we'll have questions at the end

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,440
so the first one is simplifying the

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,760
content ecosystem

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,560
the challenge here is that essentially

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,560
there's a lot of stuff

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,319
nobody really knows what's there and no

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
one's really managing it and so

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
if we don't deal with the volume or the

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
unknown

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
at the start of the project it's going

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
to take us

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
and pro causes problems all the way

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
through the end

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,200
so there's three things i like to think

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
about and how to simplify that ecosystem

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
right off the bat

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,319
the first one is about setting standards

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,040
understanding what content is valuable

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,920
to you

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,480
in that project with the organization

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,319
and then doing an inventory of the scope

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
which may change depending on what

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,080
you're doing

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,519
and then also the step of actually

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
removing the content getting rid of

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
things and purging

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,079
so the first step is around removing or

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,840
defining the standards essentially as an

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
organization before you even start to

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,840
look at content

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,520
you want to be thinking about what makes

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
content valuable for us

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,199
and it really depends where you are at

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
that moment you know how you prioritize

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,600
your users and what you're trying to

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
achieve and where

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
what shape your site is in and so

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,600
together you need to define those

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
standards and i think like i'm you know

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
always on the agency side but whether

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
you're in-house or agency

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,479
you need to kind of recommend something

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
so like you just can't go to the group

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
and be like okay let's define our values

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
like walk in with some

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,880
things that you can talk about and then

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,840
define that together

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
here's an example of a scale that i've

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
used and i've

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
like a lot of my work has turned into

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,840
like remote workshops right and like

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,759
what does that look like

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
so here's an example of something i sent

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
to a higher education

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
client and had them do on their own and

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,919
i was like basically listen we can't

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,600
decide that everything's tens

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,199
but based on this project here are some

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
things i think you should consider

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
now tell me where you're at in the level

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
and they were it was really helpful they

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
had a couple tens a couple threes and a

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,160
couple fives

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
and there we used this thing going for

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
it to decide

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,960
how when the content matched this if it

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
fit or not or if it could go

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
but essentially there's a couple buckets

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
of areas i wanna um

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,160
i like to present to clients um and you

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,840
can kind of change this

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
up but this is a nice way to think about

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
it to send that off to them so

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,400
the first one is does the content

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
support the organizational goals

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,919
um does it does the user actually need

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
it

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,280
do they want this content are you just

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,919
putting up there for yourselves

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,080
is it getting any traffic is it

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,360
regularly being updated now this content

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,039
has been sitting there for four years

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240
and nobody is like claiming it

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,080
let it go um is it getting in the way

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
of things like if you have a couple core

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
prioritized users is it just kind of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
like

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
in their space and they don't want that

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
and therefore they can't find what they

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,240
need

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
um should you be the expert in it

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
sometimes we're trying to

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,280
you know be a thought leader in this

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,479
space and we have a bunch of blog posts

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,120
about this but like

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
should you should you be that person is

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
that your

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,000
your story that you're telling um and

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
then is this the right channel to put it

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
on

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
there's a lot of um clients i'm working

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
with now where they do such infrequent

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
events or they're driving in different

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,639
ways then

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
we're doing more events off the site

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,280
because they're smaller and different

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
and more on like facebook instead or

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,639
eventbrite um and then finally is the

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
content inclusive and accessible

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
now this doesn't cover all the things

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
but this will get you started and going

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,039
in the conversation

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,520
so that when you look at a piece of

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
content um you need to kind of pick

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,280
okay well it's not getting traffic well

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
that might be okay but is it fitting

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,039
some of these other things

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,919
and essentially i'm a big person when it

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,520
comes to being a marie condo of it like

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
it really is that simple like when you

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
look at it you're like

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,400
why do we have it or like yes this is

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,280
great the user needs this

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,120
so maybe maybe bring her in and talk

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,199
about cutting content

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
i like to recommend that 50 of the

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
content is cut

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
right off the bat and i think it can

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
happen i work with the science museum in

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
minnesota years back

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
they got 75 now this site had been

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
sitting around for 11 years so it was a

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,120
little crafty

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,720
but 75 and after two years they put one

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
piece of content back on

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
um so it could be happening and i heard

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,879
a client a couple days ago talk about

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,400
how they went from twenty thousand to

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
five hundred now i feel like he was

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,440
being kind of generous and maybe it

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,599
wasn't that much

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,280
but i love it like we can let this stuff

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,039
go

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,879
all right so once we define the value

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
around and everyone's on the same page

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
it's time to inventory the scope and

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,759
it comes down to first figuring out what

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
you need to inventory like what is the

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
gap so

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
maybe you're working with a company or

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
organization that has lots of domains

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
um and instances of drupal all over the

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,639
place or maybe they're not in drupal

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,639
they're all on different platforms

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
maybe you need to inventory the content

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
types and components

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
because you're doing a massive

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
restructuring maybe it comes down to the

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,759
page level so kind of figure out what

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
that is and then figure out what the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
right

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,879
tool is to inventory and use that to

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
fill your gaps i always use the process

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
i'm like oh i didn't know you had this

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,240
and i'd understand that

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,159
um and i also divide the work up there's

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
certain things that i pass off to a

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
client to do and i think internally you

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
can share the work

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,200
the one thing i think that's super hard

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
is sharing between a document so

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
if you're going to be the person doing

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
the content inventory i think you need

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
to own that and do that piece by

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
yourself

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
so here's a couple examples of things

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
have been done this is an ecosystem map

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,120
i basically told this foundation i said

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,880
hey i am unclear of all the things

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
you're doing and this wasn't necessarily

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
like digital pieces but this was like

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
their print and their social

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,160
and like a lot of pieces are going

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
around they're connecting the website

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,640
i'm not sure what it is and i say i sent

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
him a couple articles by scott cooby has

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
a couple great blog posts on brain

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
traffic

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,760
and it's like okay read this but he's

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,600
doing more complicated things don't make

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
the ecosystem map that complicated

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
just tell me like what's connecting to

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,839
what and they came back with this most

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
beautiful thing i've ever seen and for

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
them i said i've got to show everyone

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
this but they connected this

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
by themselves but it can be as simple as

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
a spreadsheet

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,959
i just need to know what's out there and

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
what we should be looking at

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
another thing you might want to be doing

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,120
is a component inventory

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
so here's an example from university um

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
veterinary school

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,720
in which we wanted to see like what's

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
going on and in this case it was less

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
like

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
we weren't able to change the components

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,800
yet but i needed to know like

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
where's the consistency going on because

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
we're copying all the pages and changing

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
them

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,240
we should have consistency in what

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,000
components we're using so we started

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
taking stock and this is just

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,240
six of like 50. and so you know i put

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,160
down the url so we always have an

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
example the fields i see

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
a screenshot if you're able to log in

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,519
you can pull the exact fields

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
and this is always helpful not only for

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,680
the writing team but also

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
for someone doing the user experience

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
with wireframes or designs and they can

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,399
see

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,079
how we take into account for things or

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
have we decided to let some of this go

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,079
finally we have the content inventory

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
um this is just an example it changes

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
depending on

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
what i get access to but i did kind of

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,480
do it in one of three ways one

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,399
i'm doing it by hand which is painful

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
and i've done it to up to 3000 pages

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
before

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
um two i talked to my local friendly

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
developer that can pull it out of the

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
system because it's a friendly system so

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
they do an sdsp of the things i want

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,680
which i always like to get like

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,800
when things are last created and updated

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,040
and you know who the author is and um

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
any great stats on that otherwise

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
there's a great tool called screaming

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,959
frog which is more of like an

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,279
seo inventory tool and you can connect

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,320
your google analytics to that system

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,760
and export it um but essentially i lay

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
it out and what

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,680
the structure is now and then kind of

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
the key space is if you look

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,880
in kind of the early part of it the

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,120
stats column

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
i always go through the analytics and

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
look for different patterns

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
and i color code things so i do green is

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
good orange is okay

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,079
and red is bad and i do that in order to

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
um when i go back a month later or if my

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,480
client sees it we just know what the

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
color coding

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
means um and that's been really

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
successful so if you're doing this kind

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,320
of

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
task i'd suggest coming up with some

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
sort of color coding system even maybe

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,839
for your like notes that you want to

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
come

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,839
back to all right so now

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,680
we've done we've decided the content

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
scale we've got an inventory done and

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
now we're going to reduce the scope

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,760
and this is really um the process that

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
people need to understand the value of

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
it like we need to root scope now

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
so you don't have thousands of pages to

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,480
raise so we don't have to

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,800
migrate everything and we

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
you know we don't have all this

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
technical

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
writing debt long term and so getting

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
everyone on the same page of why to get

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,959
rid of it and get

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
the gung-ho rah-rah situation going on

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,320
i'm like yeah let's get it let's move it

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,600
um and then i as you know practitioner

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
but even if you're in-house

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
you know whoever's doing this own it

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
like suggest to people

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
why you should get rid of it and uh like

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
what should be gone

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
and why um it's so much easier than

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
telling someone like here's the

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
spreadsheet now go figure out what you

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,240
guys want to keep

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,839
i recommend everything like if we should

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,600
combine it we should remove it

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,000
keep it that just takes that extra brain

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
um processing off of people's plate and

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,279
then i do it in two rounds

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,200
essentially i do like a first purge and

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
a second purge the first purge

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,279
i do it and separate it because i want

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
the homework to spread out

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,880
and i also want the thinking process to

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
be different so the first purge is

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,959
really just stuff that is like

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,639
super obvious we need to go like it's

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,839
past dates it's 404

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,760
errors page not found like those just go

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
i worked with um a client where there

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
was like 2 000 this first purge and

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
they're like oh my god we got to go

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
through this and i said

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
hey just look at the top 50. they did

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
and they're like you're right i trust

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,639
you

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
just get rid of them i don't need to

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,279
look at the rest so that made the

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,519
process go faster

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
the second purge is stuff that i like i

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
think for sure should go away

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,839
but they need to take a look at that

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
because there's maybe something internal

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
i don't know

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
why they should keep it you should also

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,800
take a moment when you're doing the

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
migration to really get rid of stuff

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,240
that you don't need

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
um all my lovely developers i work with

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,440
always say lynn it's not like using

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
drupal 5 and 6 like

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
it's easy to go from 7 to 8 and just

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
push and migrate everything and i'm like

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
no

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,880
but i don't want everything over there

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
just because we can

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,199
i mean we should and so this is the time

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,959
i meet with clients and say

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,959
why do we have all these blog posts do

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,760
we is there a reason we can get rid of

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
some of them

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,839
what should we do to lighten our load at

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
this point and sometimes the developer

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
will move over anyway and then we'll

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
delete them

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
but there is this weight we just don't

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,040
need to pass on

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,199
to projects all right user-centric

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,519
the challenge here is that we don't know

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,839
who our users are

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,720
we don't know so we don't know what to

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
create for them

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
but we think we do right so we just

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
start creating content for what they

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
think

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,160
or worse we create content for what we

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
want them to care about

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
and this is not a field of dream

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
situation where if we build it they will

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,120
just come

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
we need to for sure understand what they

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
want

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
and three more things to think about i

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
swear when i started making this

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
presentation

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
everything wasn't supposed to be in

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
threes but it kind of ended up that way

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,079
but first we should take what we know we

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,920
don't need to start from scratch and

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
assume you know nothing about the users

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,920
there's a lot we know so we can document

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,399
it then we should research

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
and fill the gaps and then summarize it

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,760
and make sure that everybody can use

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
this information going forward not just

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
for

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
a free design but for marketing and

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,800
social

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
so to document what you know i would

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
search out and find the people with an

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
organization that

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
interact with the outside users these

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
are often people you wouldn't think

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
about maybe there's a helpline

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,959
people that answer the front desk

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
people there maybe there's a department

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,440
that have a lot of exterior facing

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
and get to hear that feedback those

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
people are gold mines of information

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,800
and you don't have to meet with every

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,279
single person you can write up some

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,880
questions or you can just say hey

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,480
what do you get called about a lot they

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,759
probably have a list because it's their

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
complaints that they've been trying to

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,120
fix for a long time

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
and then sit down at a workshop and

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
figure out what you know

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
who are they you know how do you connect

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,839
with them what challenges do you think

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
they face

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
and what do you think they need from you

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
and here's just an example of

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
that activity in a trello board um this

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
is a great tool i use trello for a lot

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,279
of things but you can see in the far

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,600
right or left that's maybe right for you

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
um all kind of we did this in person

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,399
right where we

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
we wrote down all the audiences and then

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
all the needs are over in the right hand

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
side where we kind of prioritize them

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,920
and then at this point

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,399
you can kind of figure out what don't

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
you know

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,639
and so it's time to research and there's

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,639
five kind of things that bubble up for

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,199
me as ways to kind of reach out to these

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
users

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,040
and i think they've changed now right

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,720
because we cannot go in context

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,560
and sit with people like i worked for

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
metro transit i cannot go sit at a bus

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440
stop anymore i suppose i could maybe but

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
i don't want to

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
right for safety for everybody so we've

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,120
got to adjust that

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
um online surveys are a love hate thing

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
for me

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
um when you do them you have to make

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,160
sure you have a high enough volume

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,360
there's a need that they want to spill

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
out and you've got to make sure you're

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
asking questions you don't know the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
answer to

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,320
early in my career in these i asked a

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
lot of questions i'm like yep

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,519
that's what i thought i'm like wait did

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
i learn anything

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,120
and i think that's for all these things

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
like have a clear purpose of what you

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
want to get out of it

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
and then make sure the questions pull

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,199
that out

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,799
um we just did a school survey on an lms

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,559
i worked with the agency that made a

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,720
custom lms and we posed like two

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,640
questions right in the lms and man

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
two days went by and we had hundreds of

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,600
students and parents writing because

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
they have a need right

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,439
they have concerns and questions and it

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,039
was super valuable

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
you can also pull together groups of

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,000
people that are affiliated with

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,919
different kind of organizations so you

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,640
can focus groups online

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,000
reviewing the data is great google

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
analytics only gets you so

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
far though so considering installing

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
something like hot jar

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,600
or crazy egg to get some heat maps and

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,440
some scatter maps for that

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,919
uh user interviews um in the initial

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,440
point it's sometimes great to talk to

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
specific people that may be

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,039
clients of who you're working with um or

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
they're your clients

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,640
and get some feedback from them and then

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,320
finally there's a lot of way to do user

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
testing along the way from

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
first click to usability testing to tree

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,200
jack testing and so on

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,880
to pull that information in and when you

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
get to the end of this

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,160
it's important to summarize um a lot of

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,760
people do

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,000
user personas i um have kind of like

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,440
a repulsion that happens to me because

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
i've seen so many of like

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
silly sally like salon walks in the

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,679
beach and likes to buy her groceries at

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,679
10 o'clock

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,679
and i those things drive me bonkers so i

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
do something more practical

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
maybe it's the german immune the project

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
manager but this is an example of what i

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
do for user types where i try to really

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,720
document what we know

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
and what we need and how that really

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
connects to what we're doing for the

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,160
project and the scope of the website

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,080
redesign

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
all right we're in topic three hopefully

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,720
i'm not talking too fast but i want to

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
make sure that we can get um to where we

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
need to go

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,280
and have question time at the end so

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
politics right what's the

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
challenge well if their voice isn't

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
heard it's going to be a problem right

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,880
they might derail the project at the

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
start they might come in the middle

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
which we call the swoop and poop right

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,320
you're working on the project

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,160
blows up and there we have it right um

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,679
or it might be a long-term problem i

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
worked on this project where

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,679
um their website was only like two years

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,200
old and i got digging in and i'm like

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,360
well i mean i can see some improvement

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
but like man they got like 80 components

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
and

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
all this flexibility and the design is

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
not too rough and it turned out that

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,640
marketing led this team

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
this project and didn't talk to it

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,799
didn't bring in

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,559
really important voices and so it was

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,919
deemed kind of like a disaster and it

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,480
needed to be redone

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
so it's really critical and the impact

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,080
of not doing this

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,080
it can be financially

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,960
all right we got three things again

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,559
um first we need to make sure we're

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,160
hearing their perspective they know

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,280
we're hearing it and we're incorporating

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
it because we're not just

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
doing this to make sure people feel

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
heard people got some really good

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,120
information and vision so we want to

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,840
make sure we can bring that in

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
the second thing is we want them to feel

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
part of

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
the strategy that content strategy and

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
direction of the project at the start

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,360
they need to have some sort of stake in

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,520
it and approve it

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,480
and then we need to bring them data

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,159
throughout so

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
there's this initial thing of bringing

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,720
it in but then there's this constant

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,679
thing throughout the project of like

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
what are you doing over there what's

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,240
going on so

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
meeting with stakeholders every three

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
weeks to show them what we're doing and

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,840
then provide

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,520
real data at critical points

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,919
so let's talk about what that looks like

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,000
so gaining their perspective is best

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
done i think with stakeholder interviews

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it's a really fast process you can get

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
on the phone for 30 to 45 minutes with

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
someone

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
um so it's not an expensive process and

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,360
people really get their voices heard

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,799
i prefer to do one-on-one because i

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,200
really feel like people just kind of

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,480
like

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
build this rapport with you and just

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
kind of tell you everything and when

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
there's a group of people

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,320
people like um tiptoe around and it kind

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
of changes dynamics so if you can do

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,280
one-on-one that's great

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,039
um and i also think it's an opportunity

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,320
to fill holes that you have so maybe

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,919
you're working internally and you're

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,200
meeting with the c-suite or different

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,799
other stakeholders

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
and maybe you don't know what's going on

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,559
with the new direction and it's your

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,760
chance to pull stuff out um i love to do

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,440
it because like maybe

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
maybe this field or space is not

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
something i'm accustomed to and i can

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,679
pull out information about the

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,320
marketplace

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,559
so it's a great thing to do from that

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,640
here's an example of some

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,240
questions it continues to go on the page

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
but you kind of get the picture i

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,679
change this every single time i do a

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
project because i want

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,799
to include questions that fill in the

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
holes

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,039
for what i don't know and i can do a

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
better job i also like to share it with

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,480
my clients beforehand

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,159
because it turns out it's the start of

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
the project i don't know a ton of stuff

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
yet

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,080
so they can make this document a lot

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,080
better and add a lot of questions to it

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,120
all right so once we've kind of got that

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,720
we want to get

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,880
their approval of the strategic

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
direction and so typically

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
a create a brief or strategic brief

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,520
comes out of a workshop the kickoff

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,080
meeting

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,559
um so there may be at that meeting maybe

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
not

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,320
but we want to make sure they know that

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
we brought their feedback to

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,520
that conversation and a nice form of a

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
summary

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,159
and then what we want to do is document

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,640
um that strategic brief right and

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
get it written down approve and pass it

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,520
around and if we can include any

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,880
information

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,880
around like real data um and voices

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,960
i'm sorry for some reason something in

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
my house is beeping and my son's alarm's

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,400
going off so this will go on forever

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,400
can anyone tell me if you can hear that

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,159
we cannot hear it yes okay wait you can

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,679
barely all right we're gonna go on

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
because otherwise i gotta get up and

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,240
walk down

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,240
and it's not gonna be good all right

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
so there's a strategic direction

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,320
oh my god hold on i'm gonna pause one

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
second

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,840
i'm gonna scream

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,559
okay um

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,640
okay so we want to get their approval

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,120
and know it's there but we also want to

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
include

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,480
real information and data at this point

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,760
from our users right

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
because we're not just bringing

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,919
everyone's feedback on we're going to

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
show them like

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,799
what is really happening out there

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,159
because sometimes people have opinions

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,799
and once they see the real data they're

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,480
like oh

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,080
okay well that was just my thoughts but

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
now when we see the real stuff

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,799
um i get it here's an example of what a

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,559
strategic brief might look like it's

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,799
just a snapshot of it

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,400
but the five core things i want in it is

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
you know what who they are at the core

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,760
like

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,039
why are they getting up and you know out

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
of their bed in the day what is their

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
mission

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
what are they trying to achieve what's

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
their business model

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,159
what does the marketplace look like who

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,840
are their users and what do they need

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,880
which hopefully we've figured out with a

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
different process

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,360
and then really what are we going to do

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,679
accomplish in this project what are the

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,600
goals the risks the kpis

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,799
um and that gets written down and

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,200
becomes our guiding

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240
guiding post now we do have the problem

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
that there are

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
um challenges throughout the project of

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,640
like why are you doing that why is my

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
stuff getting hidden

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
um and because this is like anywhere

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
from c-suite to the professor to someone

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,520
a different department they're all

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
different levels in an organization

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,679
and so we need to bring in some data and

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,360
user testing at some point

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
so i think when you kind of figure out

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,039
what your problem is pick the right

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,279
solution that will best address their

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:23,200
concerns and questions um so that

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,720
they kind of calm down and don't

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,279
continue to bring that

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,200
challenge along with the project um and

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,720
the nice thing is that user testing is

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,159
great for everything so this is a bonus

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,520
for the project um

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,679
the other thing i've realized is that

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,520
people want like a 20-page report

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,559
like i need it and i don't need to go

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
through it but they want this really

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,600
nice summary

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
um to get the information so here's a

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
couple of things you might do

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,159
so early in the project like i mentioned

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
you might want to sell

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,640
like a hot jar or crazy egg um i always

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,159
find these super helpful especially like

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,360
navigation wise or where people are

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,360
going on a page

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
i was just reviewing this for a client

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,480
and their homepage like they just drop

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,240
off literally like

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,000
past the banner gone that's a problem

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,320
so that's really good to look at when we

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,080
start the project at the top

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
to get that information and share that

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,600
with people

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
another great tool is tree jack testing

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,640
um so folks don't know what that is it's

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
a sitemap testing and

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
optimal workshop has a really great

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,240
online tool where essentially you put in

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
your structure you ask 10 questions

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
and it gives you the results of how fast

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,880
somebody can get there

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,400
and if they got to the right place and

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,919
what i like about this is i like

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
separated into two tests

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
one for external people and one from

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,960
internal people and so when the people

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
are complaining about where their stuff

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
is

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,840
we can get results to say hey you're

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,279
you know they are getting there or you

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
know what you're right we have the wrong

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,799
label or it's

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,880
in the right wrong spot and then of

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
course usability testing is great

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,720
um this is just kind of a notes document

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,760
from that but you know once you have

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
something built

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,360
on your drupal platform you kind of walk

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,320
through with users and find it

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,400
i find that you know 75 of it is content

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
they can't find it they're not scanning

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,640
um so it's a great thing you know they

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,559
recommend five people but honestly if

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,960
you do just three people remotely

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,760
you can get the bulk of your concerns

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,600
out right there

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,559
all right um we're doing okay for time

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,000
um the next section is providing tools

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
for non-writers

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,039
the challenge here is that either you

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,880
don't have the budget to hire

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
writers which i'm in a situation all the

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
time because i work with a lot of

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,919
non-profits

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,919
um or your internal staff doesn't have

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,960
time or experience writing but it's on

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,760
their plate to do

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,880
right so we need to help folks with that

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,720
and again

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,320
classically three ways to think about

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
that first

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,360
simplify that process of creating the

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,039
page

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,039
then we're going to help people gather

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,360
better content to start with

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,320
and then maybe maybe we can eke out a

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,279
little bit of money

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,799
to get some actual um writing help so

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,360
the first one is around simplifying the

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
page

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,039
and so the challenge really here is that

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
you tell people to go right and they're

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,679
they've got to sign these 10 pages they

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,559
have to write they're staring at a blank

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
page

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,679
what they do is they copy and paste

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
what's on the old site and they start

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,000
copy

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
editing and oftentimes the site is in

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,480
such bad shape that's not where we want

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
to start

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,080
so i would suggest creating a simple

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,320
template for people to fill out

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,840
um in the country strategy space a lot

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
of people use something called page

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,480
tables

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,480
which i find um like that structure is

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,360
too much there's often like 15 to 20

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,000
fields that people

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,600
have like it's more becomes a checklist

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,480
like i just want the simple things so we

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,559
can focus on

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
what the page is about and we can start

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,279
thinking about the structure it's going

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,399
to take in the content types and

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,320
components

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,919
so here's an example of what i do and i

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,279
call them page priorities because i want

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,039
my clients to really start thinking

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,440
about what's the priority on the page

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,320
how does this page need to flow down so

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,480
i ask them

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,679
to fill out five things who needs the

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,559
content

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,159
what are the goals of this page what are

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,600
the user questions when they come there

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,240
what are they asking what do they need

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
to know

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,840
and then what content supports that and

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
we start to think about what type of

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
component will fill that

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
in you know what are we having a banner

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,720
we have a three class with icons

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,799
and then where are we going to go next

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
what's where it's the next place

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,240
so i often fill out like maybe five to

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,720
ten of these on a project

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,240
and then um send it off and then the

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,399
client can use this tool it's a great

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,039
tool like we're i'm working with this um

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,559
theater and we're they have a whole new

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,159
community concept going on

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,159
um trying to figure out how to work

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,440
remotely and they're like trying to

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,640
explain to me like i don't really get it

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,320
they're like lynn should i do a page

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,159
party i'm like yes

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,919
you should do that and they filled it

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
out and it made perfect sense and they

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,039
really understood

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,880
what they wanted on it so it's a great

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
tool for that

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
the next thing is to make sure you get

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,600
quality content so maybe you're on a

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,480
team where you have a bunch of people

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,200
internally passing content on to you

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,440
and it comes in all shapes and sizes so

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,840
i think there's two ways to attack that

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
one is to have an editorial content

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
guide

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,679
style guide essentially that they can

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
use oftentimes these things

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,760
are pages and pages and pages and pages

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,960
long that's not going to help them

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,799
they're not going to look through it so

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
take that document and make a one to two

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,159
page cheat sheet

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
and make it custom to your challenges

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,240
like i don't care what any other

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
organization

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,080
is whatever keeps recurring for you as

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
problems make sure you tell them how to

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,919
fix that in that document

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,000
so that's one thing to get them started

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,520
the next thing is have them submit the

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
content with the submission form that

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,000
guides them

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,120
here's an example from ieee which i

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
found on the internet which i thought

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
was

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,880
fun and i can't even remember what the

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
acronym stands for and because of this

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,440
view i can't see my notes but it's like

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,320
an

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,279
electrical engineering chemical society

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,200
of some sort

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,320
but they put on their form like hey

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
twitter short

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,640
it's 140 character like people kind of

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,760
know that but you know what i bet they

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
got a lot of submissions

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,840
that were way over 140 characters so

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,039
they're getting people to think about it

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,120
they're telling them it needs to be

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,360
conversational that they need to use an

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,799
eye-catching photo these are the things

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
that can kind of just help people that

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,279
aren't doing the content

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,399
all the time get that also maybe

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,960
consistent content to you

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,279
finally if you can hire someone if

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
there's a thousand two thousand dollars

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
in the pool there's three things i would

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
put the money towards one

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,559
creating a content style guide getting

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,799
that set up for you

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,360
two having them write five to ten of

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,960
your top pages that you can then use to

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,159
cheat from like copy from and make the

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,000
rest of your pages

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,840
or create your content first and have

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
them copy edit as much as the time

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,320
allows

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
to get the tone and voice consistent

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,600
across the pages

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,440
so if you can do that that's what i

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,720
would set your time and money aside for

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,159
it's a big help all right finally

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
um we're going to talk about the

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,840
creation process and so so much of

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,000
content strategy is a rally

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,679
about project management honestly like

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
how do we get it done

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,039
and so the challenge is maybe that you

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
know maybe you've been through redesign

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,240
before maybe you work on your drupal

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,399
site all the time but

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,720
you know you're not the person that's in

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,720
charge of the process and nobody is

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
so when you start go to writing you

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
spend like a month just trying to figure

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,279
out like what are we gonna do like where

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
do we put this why do we do that and

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,320
it's like

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,240
overwhelming so many clients i'm like

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
you haven't started well i was figuring

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,799
this

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,880
nope just just stop so the first thing

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,840
is time box yourself get this plan done

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,200
in a week so you can move on to writing

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,880
but there's a couple things you need to

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
think about when you do it

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
first need to make sure that you've

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,679
identified a lead someone needs to be in

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,600
charge of this process

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
it needs to be realistic just because

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,120
we've identified 200 pages

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,120
rate doesn't mean it needs to be there

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
at launch so figure out what needs to be

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,080
done

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,559
and what you can set aside for later

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,039
keep all your tools simple

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,120
just because one of the writing tools

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,200
that i've used before is gather content

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,960
amazing tool it does not make any sense

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,159
for one to two people

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,640
it doesn't it's a team tool so you gotta

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,240
pick

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,240
what makes the most sense because your

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,720
tool cannot overrun your process

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,159
when you have a process write it down

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
and then implement authority

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,960
i mean people can have opinions but

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,000
we're gonna have one way to go and we're

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
gonna move on

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
and then we gotta hold our team

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,600
accountable and it's not just about

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,799
calling them out

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,960
because you'll need to call some people

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,000
out but it's a providing help you meet

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,159
every single week

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,760
you help them so this might be hard for

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,559
some people maybe they're not called to

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,240
do this

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
and let's be honest like i have my

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
children downstairs you just heard his

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,960
alarm go off i have a dog running around

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
like

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,360
it's hard right now so any support we

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,720
can give people you know

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,039
virtual hugs is great so here's what i

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,200
do

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,120
so i'm not internal so it's really

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,000
technically not on my plate to do but i

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,519
do a workshop

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
and i cover a lot of different things

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,120
when it's time to write

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,399
migration plan being one of them this is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,399
what other thing i talk about

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,399
i put forth here's what i think you

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,480
should do and i also say

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,760
hey you don't have to do it but i'm

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,559
trying to provide you at least with

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,799
something for

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,399
this is like a whole of what to do and

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,279
then you can go and make your own

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
process

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,799
and i think this is great so anyone out

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,640
there that is on the agency side

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,559
put together what you think is the right

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,840
process and share that with them so at

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,279
least they have something

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,799
to go off of so i first talk about the

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,440
content style guide which hopefully

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,880
we've done

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,799
already by the time we're going to get

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
to writing i tell people to gather all

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,679
their media assets right in the

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,000
beginning they're approved

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,120
in the folder all together it saves them

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,960
way much more time

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,399
than pulling an image every single time

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,159
you want them

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,000
they need to create a workflow talk

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,240
about how is this going to go from

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
idea to published on drupal in this

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,399
specific process

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,000
keep it simple they need a location to

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,200
be writing are they going to write word

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,880
and google

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,600
maybe they decide to gather content's a

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,080
good option they got to set deadlines

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,279
for it i give them the ultimate due date

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,840
the due date

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,200
is the time they get training i want all

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,799
their content done so they need to work

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,080
a schedule backwards

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,320
they're going to start creating content

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,000
at some point right and then i want them

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,960
to test it and we'll talk about that

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,080
a little bit and then as i mentioned we

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
really got to monitor

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,600
and provide support but there are people

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,039
you're going to have to hold accountable

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,720
for and it's hard because

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,960
everyone is already working 40 plus

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,399
hours a week um so it's a challenge

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,079
that's why if you can eke out a little

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,560
money for a writer it's really helpful

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,159
for that

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,000
so let's dive into a couple of these

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,280
before we wrap up here but first i

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,200
wanted to show you this is just an

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,359
example for one of my current clients

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,119
they decided to use a trello board this

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
is actually not how my brain works at

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,200
all so this probably wouldn't be my

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
format

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,480
but it works for them they've tagged

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,760
people they've color coded it based on

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,359
where it's at

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,119
um and they're dragging and sliding

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,520
things and they're making their content

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,480
so this is a very simple tool and might

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,200
be a good one

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,560
for you to try out but to dive into a

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,839
couple of those items

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,760
um one might be a workshop around

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,079
workflow that might be something that

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,320
you guys want to do

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,919
and it's kind of a simple workshop that

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,599
can be done in six steps

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,599
so the first one is when you sit down

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
together as a team virtually

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,040
you want to show an example of what

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,560
workflow means and can look like so

00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,760
everybody can kind of visually picture

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,359
what this might be

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,520
and then start with one content type

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,320
like maybe you know a blog post

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,400
or some critical piece of content but

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,839
you can see a clear path for

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,760
and then we're going to try to imagine

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,200
what that can be and so in person that

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
might be post-it notes trying to figure

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,839
it out

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,839
um but pull up trello and make little

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,760
cards like here's the steps it's gonna

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,680
be we're gonna assign people to it

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,160
and then you hash out where the problems

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,760
are um how is this not gonna work

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,760
why should this be different can we

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,160
simplify this for this process

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
i always think about the simplification

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
and then come

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,480
do it with the rest of the content types

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,880
and make sure you have that set up

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,640
before you start writing content

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,640
another thing i like to talk about is

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,079
the testing there's four areas that we

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
want to think about when it comes to

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,880
testing our content

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,200
accessibility is really critical it also

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,520
tends to be the most expensive thing so

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,240
if that is a high priority for your

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,680
project think about the money that you

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,440
need to set aside to have the right

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,240
people testing with people of all

00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
abilities

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,440
there's also a lot of things developers

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,200
can do

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,960
to a certain level but you know that

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,119
actual testing with folks

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
is really important um if you want to

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,760
hit a certain level

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,160
make sure your site is set for that in

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
your content especially

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,599
then findability and comprehension if

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,960
people can find things and then process

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,480
what it is and do something

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,160
that can be done with the usability

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,960
testing so when you have it in the site

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,640
they're doing it

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,040
you can have some questions specific to

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,560
that readability is really the easiest

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,160
things and that's what i tell my clients

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
no matter what we're going to do this

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,920
and

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
just use this tool readable.com you can

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,480
copy your text

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
you throw it in here and it's going to

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,000
give you a grade level

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,079
i usually hear around the industry that

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
like grade 4 is great i tell people

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,359
grade six because i think it's really

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,720
hard to get there but essentially what

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,520
we're trying to do is

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,320
shorter sentences scannable chunks small

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,320
words

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,440
um and that's not just good for people

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,280
that have low um

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,280
reading abilities but also like for

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,040
google and for us because

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,000
everybody else you know we're lazy we

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,000
want to scan and do things like that

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,359
so those are the five things i've only

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
left eight minutes which i feel

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,240
absolutely terrible about

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,880
um but you know cut down your content

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,040
make sure you're reaching your users um

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,040
manage that politics so you don't have

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,560
massive problems through the middle um

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,240
provide the support for those people

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,800
working really hard to get the content

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,040
done

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,200
and then establish a clear process so

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,880
that you can get to the end

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,320
as we kind of jump into questions i just

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,560
wanted to share

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,240
a couple of books that i really like if

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839
you're looking for something new to read

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,160
a couple of them are some really oldies

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,680
but goodies but these are kind of some

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,119
things i like and if you're trying to

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,640
figure out what you want to have in your

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,440
content process i think the content

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,200
strategy cool

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,119
toolkit's a really good one it has lots

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,359
of different ideas that you can pick and

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
pull from um but if you want to reach me

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,320
you can make your own linkedin otherwise

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,480
the two websites are up there my

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,320
personal one and the conference one

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,160
so i am going to jump over chad has been

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,040
moving the whole time i have no idea

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,160
what it's saying

00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,440
is so um how do you balance the need for

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,160
in-depth ux research with avoiding

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,760
too many cooks in the kitchen situation

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
how do you know what you have enough

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,079
user feedback

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,520
and it just scrolled past um

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,079
i think the key with that is identifying

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,680
the authority and lead at the point so

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,880
one thing i didn't talk about is when i

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,200
start any project

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,040
we have a conversation about who's the

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,880
internal stakeholder or the

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,160
the first level stakeholders and second

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,000
level stakeholders and i

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,359
outline what that means you know what

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,560
are the responsibilities you got to come

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,240
to all the meetings

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,920
you have to reveal the documentation you

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,680
have a lot of homework

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,440
you need to be able to speak for the

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,560
organization as a whole and not just

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
your piece

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,160
and i outline that and then i say okay

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,200
but if you don't fit into that you don't

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,119
have time

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
you can be an exter the second layer

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,760
stakeholder group

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,200
and that means you get to look at things

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
but you're not going to derail our track

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,920
we're going to move forward we'll

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
certainly take your feedback

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,240
into um consideration but that might not

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,079
change where we're going

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,400
and so if we outline that and people

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,240
self select that sense to help a lot

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,160
and that second level group i always

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,599
have my clients meet with them every

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,359
like three weeks because there's always

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,400
some sort of document in a redesign

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,800
that's coming up

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,960
and so people tend to just want to know

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,599
like what's going on and want to know

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,599
that like

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,040
you're here to listen to them if they

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,119
have something come up

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,640
um it's that you know unknown of what's

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,560
going on there that really just kind of

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,480
throws people off so i try to be really

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,839
direct about like what you're gonna have

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,680
an opinion about or what you're not

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,800
gonna have an opinion out

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
and then there needs to be a clear

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,079
person at the end of the day where the

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,119
buck stops about where the decision is

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,599
and then i think there was a question

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,960
about too much user testing you know

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,520
i believe in mvp um process um or very

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,040
lean

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,680
and so to me it's usually maybe

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,200
two items maybe three like at most maybe

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,400
their stakeholder interviews

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,240
there's some user research of some sort

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
and then there's like confirmation when

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,640
we do usability testing

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,520
um but if the project budget has it and

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
you get to do more

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,720
fantastic but at some point there's a

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,359
bloat situation going on with the

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
timeline

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,000
and maybe some of that should happen

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,240
afterwards like you can always do

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,960
usability testing after the launch

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
and get that feedback from there um

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,400
slides will be posted

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,319
i'll send a link post it on my linkedin

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
as well as

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,400
twitter and if you don't see it ping me

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
another question is

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,839
i think we talked about that one oh i

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,839
need to scroll sorry guys

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
um

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,800
what if you are a public agency and

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,880
everything becomes a matter of public

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
record thoughts on how to thoughtfully

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,640
let things

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:42,079
go hmm

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,079
well i'm not sure what we're letting go

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,160
so i think that that um is a question

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,000
i think it's important anything that

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
i've created i've always known that that

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,160
can be shared with a client or internal

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,960
or anywhere and we would always be okay

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,880
with it

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,560
so i think if you're always if you

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
approach projects knowing that you're

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,240
trying to make

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
the right choices for users and you can

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,079
document that

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,960
i think that can be public but i can't

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,480
imagine ryan

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,240
i don't have that possible um

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,520
standard on most things i do so i think

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,319
it's a little tricky

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
but i think um no kind of setting out

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,200
the standards like

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,480
around accessibility or how involved you

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,240
need to have the users

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,920
explaining to them what your process is

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,839
upfront and posting that

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,200
executing on that process and sharing

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
what you have is the best you can

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,599
probably do

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,440
and then you know you're still going to

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,240
get people that want you to do different

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,319
things

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,480
but i think if you're the goal of

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,760
supporting the user i think that's the

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,839
best approach you can take um

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,359
we currently have a group in the middle

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,800
which gets copy

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,160
via email and word docs is it worthwhile

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,280
moving the content creation

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,560
out of the content we're in originators

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,079
this is a large institution

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,079
i currently have a group of people

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,839
i'm not sure i fully understand that

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,839
question nathan

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,119
it's copy via email so i think you're

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,440
saying we get it in different places

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,400
um and it's a large group so do we want

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,599
to push that

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,599
boat and steer it a new direction

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,280
i think the question is how much burden

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,960
does that put on you

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,280
um if they're getting in different ways

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,760
that's and it's not killing you that's

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,000
okay

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,079
i also think in a large group maybe a

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,839
submission form or a ticketing system

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,839
might be a good way to go and slowly

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,760
move people to that so i think

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,119
how much pain would that cause you to

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,800
live the way you are and

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,800
and how much is it going to improve

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,520
going forward and i hope i answered that

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,040
it's just so much harder like this

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,640
um any other questions

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,359
still trying to scroll up we got one

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
minute left

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,119
how do you as a content specialist talk

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,640
to tech colleagues about the advantages

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,359
of doing the content work as part of

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,119
migration

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,359
that's a really good question hannah

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,400
i've actually since i went freelance

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,560
i've been working with different

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,359
agencies and i've realized

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,440
that i i started doing things and nobody

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,160
cared or nobody took them and went with

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,200
them

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,560
and so not only do i have a problem with

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,880
a development team

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,240
understand and value it i have it it's

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,400
different at every agency

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,240
so i've kind of reached out and started

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,680
doing like post-mortems

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,680
when i start working with new agencies

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,520
to figure out what value it is i also

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,560
try to be a little more transparent

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160
what i was doing i was kind of just

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,839
doing my thing and the client was fine

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,760
but i was finding value

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,880
and then it kind of disappeared and so i

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,040
tried to say

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,960
how can my work translate into a

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,280
developer's world

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,480
and what do i need them to care about

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,920
right like i don't need them to care

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,200
about all the things i'm doing i need

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,280
them to care about the things i need

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,800
them to execute on so it's a little bit

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,480
of kind of

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,240
educating a little you know they don't

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,359
know and um

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,880
and i don't know all the things they do

00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,440
right so we got to educate each other

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,400
and then

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,240
kind of um just figuring out what works

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,760
best for them it's so it's been a little

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,760
bit of a slower process for me

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,280
i'm scrolling down

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,040
there was a design first question above

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,319
and i don't know where it is above but

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,319
somebody commented that

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,280
would giving a user the ability to

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,640
search archives for past content

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,720
migration

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,720
the need to let go of content

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,280
ability to search archives for passcode

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,599
and immigration

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,520
um i'm not exactly sure the question

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,200
thomas i took it in two ways one

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,280
like if we don't if i can't have my

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,640
content and it goes away but i let it go

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,560
how can i go back to it

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,920
and so one solution i've seen with

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,920
clients is that we keep their old

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,520
instance up for like six months to a

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,760
year and see if they

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,359
um need it and then see if they can let

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,560
it go i find that's really helpful for

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,720
school districts people

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,760
panic that they can't just copy and

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,920
paste something

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,760
so we a lot of time leave an old site up

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,280
there for a while

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,599
another thing could be exporting it into

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
a spreadsheet and that becomes a tool

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,560
but i think the question is like why is

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,640
it repository

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,400
is that for the user is that internal if

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,119
it's just an internal repository of

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,800
content

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,800
is there a reason why we should have it

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,359
on the website um

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,880
we've got to rethink um how we save

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,720
things and where

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,520
we're looking for them internally at

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,240
that point i know it's a massive shift

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,359
but we need to rethink that process

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,359
because we don't need to bring that over

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,720
um i know we are at time so i don't know

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,960
if folks want to leave

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:49,200
um so i'm just probably wrap this up

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,119
um slide slide slides yes i will post

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
them um i'll put them on linkedin and

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,079
twitter

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,839
after this guys uh really thanks for

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,599
joining me i really appreciate it um i

00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,680
love connecting with people so feel free

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,760
to reach out to me

no idea where you are at but i hope you

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,440
are safe and happy and having a great

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,839
