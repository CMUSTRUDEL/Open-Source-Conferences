hopefully we are good to go so i said

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,440
yeah we got the number of number of

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,599
responses and the hotspots were

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,000
united states germany and the united

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,000
kingdom

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,039
the companies that we surveyed are

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
gradually getting older and older every

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
year there is a

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
there's the of course you can't have

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,000
that

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,359
money but the trend is that there will

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
be there's more and more

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
other companies and then there are only

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,360
a few

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
uh young ones and this is partially a

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
bit

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,079
problematic that we should have more and

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,760
more

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
new companies joining joining the

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
business because otherwise it gets bit

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
stale

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,800
that it's the same old people every

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
single time

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
if you take a look at the company's size

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
and growth there's a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,879
single man bands there's a lot of those

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
there's surprisingly a lot also

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
companies that

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
are small the sweet spot seems to be

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,320
from 11 to 50 people

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
and then there are a few bigger ones and

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,080
what i see

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,680
problematic is that one

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,159
third or a bit less maybe

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
one fourth of the companies has shown no

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
growth

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
in the past year in headcount of course

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
if you are one person

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,000
then adding the second one is is a big

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,439
step it's it's like doubling the company

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,159
but you should start because if we

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,880
if we don't grow and our competitors are

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,840
growing

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
then actually we are shrinking and it's

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,240
never good for the business

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,880
the company size first age you can see

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,320
that the uh if you see my cursor that

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,520
the lot of the companies

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:59,759
are here in the sort of metro stage

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,119
and it's uh problematic i would say that

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,200
we have a lot of

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
old companies that are really small of

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
course if you want to run a boutique

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,760
then that that's okay

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,000
boutiques won't

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,520
change the world that much there are a

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,680
few good ones that there have been

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
companies that are like two years old

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
two years old and are already grown to

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
almost 100 people

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,959
so really good good good things for for

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,280
those companies

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,879
keep up and for those that are

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
considering that they should grow that

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
my

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
opinion advice always that you should

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
grow

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
because if you don't grow the business

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
goals easily stale and then

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,920
somebody else is the actual business

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
then you find out that you have no

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,480
business

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,480
if you take a look at the deals

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,440
these are the top 10 industries

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,160
education that was missing in 2018

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,360
18 uh survey we added there and it went

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,040
to went to top

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
immediately so this means that 66

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,760
of the companies that responded are

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
working with education

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,040
and then the australia is a non-profit

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
government public administration

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
healthcare arts and culture banking

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,159
insurances travel

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,360
media industry consultancy

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,400
and if you take a look at it at the four

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
of the four

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
top 10 industries are somewhat

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
problematic that the

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
charities and non-profits and government

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,360
and public administration

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,720
typically have small budgets not all

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
government stuff

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,680
that that can have huge budgets

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
but they have long contracts and they

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
focus on price so they

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
they have a they sort of create a

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,159
baseline where you can

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,760
have a good business but the

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,200
private sector has way more

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,319
potential for a bigger bigger hourly

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
hourly prices and so forth arts and

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,439
culture is typically

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,200
very small budget unless you go to

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
hollywood or some others but i would

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
guess that that would be some other

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,560
industry and then the consulting has

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
consultancy has shrunk from 2018 and

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
it's

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
i would say that they're working with

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
the with consultancies would we are

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,959
really really good

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
on the other side uh banking and

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
insurance is more and more people are

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
working there

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,720
they have a lot of money industry is

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
always good that if you manufacture

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,680
something and then you do digital

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,520
then the digital cost even if it's it's

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
typically a fraction

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
of the industrial cost but it's still

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
huge because a lot of industrial

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,320
companies are very very big giants

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,240
so that's also very good place to be

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
bit of an eye test here but this shows

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
the aldi

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,320
all the industries in the order of

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,440
of uh interest of the order of the of

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,840
the

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:02,080
clients of our agencies 2019

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,400
and there is uh clothing and fashion

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
marketing advertising and media that

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
have been

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,720
going steadily down from year to year

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
for the marketing advertising and media

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
that's understandable because the budget

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,240
are shrinking their

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
clothing and fashion is is something

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,160
that i would

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
rather see people serving more because

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
there's uh

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,400
there are huge huge companies there that

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
would benefit from drupal

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
industry is growing and banking and

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
insurance is growing and that's that's

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,120
really good

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
that we we go already where the money is

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,080
but all in all

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,960
drupal agencies tend to serve too much

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,720
public non-profit ngo kind of

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,759
industries instead of those ones that

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,960
have the money and this is not that you

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
should sell your values and go for the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
money

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
that's not my point but point is that if

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,240
you have your values

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
and then you can make good business in

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
the area where

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,240
there's a lot of money to be made your

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,440
company grows bigger

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,560
and then your values will affect more

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,160
and more of the people so never

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,240
underestimate the

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
good clients even if they are in some

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
area that that doesn't feel sort of

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,199
right to you because

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,840
it might be a really good way also to

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,600
change the world not just to get get a

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,039
good amount of return of investment for

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,720
your own company drupal project

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,639
pipeline small

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
or it has been growing for the growing

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
for the most of the companies and

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,120
that that's really good to see that yeah

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,000
it's it has

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
the trend is positive of course the

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,759
cornerbacks will change that will come

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
that you later so this is pre-kernel

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
virus

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,120
information of course average deal size

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
the same thing

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,440
that it has grown for the most of the

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
companies almost 60 percent of the

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,639
companies have

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
have grown the average deal size and

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,440
this is crucial

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,960
for the growth because at the end the

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,400
amount of sales work

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
you need to do for a bigger smaller case

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
is

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,199
approximately the same of course if you

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
sell to your friends and small companies

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,039
it's

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,080
way easier than to sell to enterprises

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,720
that that's that's sure but

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,720
if you have same kind of companies and

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,360
one have a 100k deal

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
and then the other one has a 500k deal

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
then probably

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,039
the sales effort is approximately the

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,240
same on both of these

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:49,280
so try to grow the deal sizes

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,720
the pipeline expectations were that 60

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,639
percent see that they will they will

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,919
grow and only 11 percent

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,800
thought that they will they will shrink

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
so again really good position to be in

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,240
on the

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
on the market

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
then if we take a look at that what what

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,319
the companies thought that what are the

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,039
reasons to select drupal

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
there is the open source they have used

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,759
drupal before

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
our recommendation flexibility

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,639
suitability for the business

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
requirements reputation security

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,280
reliability low cost performance

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
and the user friendliness that is the

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,960
rock bottom

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
that nobody chooses almost no but i

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
would like to meet those people that say

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,599
that yes we selected drupal because of

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,320
user friendliness

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,839
but so far i haven't seen but if you

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
know somebody then please introduce

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,120
me to them because i would like to

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:45,120
interview them that how they see it but

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,000
the good things for the agencies are

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
that the

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
that the agency recommendation is the

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,360
number three

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,880
and that's means that the clients have

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,480
trust

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,440
on the agency and that's extremely

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
crucial

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
flexibility and reliability are also and

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,240
reliability has grown

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,399
really really a lot compared to 2018

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,040
it shows that the platform is getting

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,240
more and more mature

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,480
and that the uh there are no sort of

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
hiccups that would convince people to go

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,519
somewhere else that the baseline again

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,080
is good uh i said the user friendliness

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,560
all right it's something that rhys has

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
been talking a lot and the uh i'm glad

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
to see that

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
there's uh things are moving forward it

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
was

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
sad that the the admin user interface

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,040
changes did not land with

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:48,240
uh drupal 9 hopefully they land sooner

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,760
than later we all rely a lot on that

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,120
and then the other one is uh sort of

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,160
this bit positive a bit negative that

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,040
they have used drupal before uh it's

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,320
really good that

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,920
the the platform has traction

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,839
the people are not actively hating

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:14,000
using drupal but again

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:18,880
that if it's the top two

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,680
of the reasons it means that we are

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,360
having a discussion with the same people

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
that the market is not growing for us

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,399
that we don't uh

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
reach out people that have not used

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,600
drupal that much

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
and this is something that should also

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,959
change and that changes with

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,279
marketing and sales those two things

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,640
the usual sales process in drupal

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
companies

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,959
seems to be that everybody waits

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,240
aggressively the phone rings

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,640
when it rings then you pick it

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
up and then then the customer tells what

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
you what they want and then you try to

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
try to figure out how to how to serve

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,880
them

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,920
instead of proactively making the market

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,120
and that shows in that the

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,399
more than 60 percent of the companies

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
feel that the reason for

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,519
choosing drupal is that the clients have

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,360
used it before

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
if you take a look at a bit different

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
angle we also ask about the about the

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,959
contributions

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,440
what the companies are that this is the

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,120
drupal is giving a lot to the companies

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
what are companies giving back to the

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,720
community

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,120
and it's a big big

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
area that what kind of things get gets

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
gets contributed

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
four percent of the companies meaning

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,560
five or six companies

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,000
don't contribute but everybody else

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,000
has been contributing different things

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
somebody has doing design usability

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,760
really good good thing because that is

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,279
really needed a lot of development

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,920
documentation donations marketing

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
organizing even sponsoring events so a

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,959
lot of

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,040
this area a lot of using

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,240
non-technical people or using money

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,720
to work for the for the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
quadruple and this is area where for

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
example the

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,160
contribution credits don't

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,120
really well take that into account that

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
there is

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,920
if there's an event yes then then the

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
people people get the contribution

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,920
credits for participating that event

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,760
if the organizer is so so

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,279
organized that there is possibility to

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,600
do it

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,320
but other than that if you do if you

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,519
participate in expose if you do

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,200
marketing campaigns none of those is

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,399
reflected back to the

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,880
back to the community credits

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
and this is something if i'm wrong then

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,079
please please correct me because i would

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,200
like to be wrong in this one

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,079
but i see that it's still tilted to

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,360
development

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,560
and tilted in a work that

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,560
revolves around drupal.org

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,720
either the code hosted there or the

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,880
events hosted there

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,160
and we should be everywhere else

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,320
and drupal.org because the clients are

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,839
not in drupal.org or if they are there

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
they already know a lot and

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
that you don't need to preach to preach

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,720
to the joy but instead

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,800
we should meet the people that don't

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,200
know drupal well or they have

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,120
they have used past in drupal 2 or 304

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
and not since because a lot of has

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
changed

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
then we asked a lot of a lot of uh that

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
why people contribute what are the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,959
reasons and

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,000
uh uh there was uh

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,160
i think that the uh the giving back

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,600
was one of the big biggest reasons that

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,839
drupal has been kind to us

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
so we need to be kind to drupal and the

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,279
people understood that without

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
contribution there would be no drupal

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,160
but it's also this is important

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,199
that the people in the company want to

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:30,880
contribute

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:32,639
so be so enabling that somehow makes you

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,519
giving back to the community was

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,639
mentioned 19 times

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,519
so one-sixth of the people

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
mentioned that exactly with these words

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
give back to the community of giving

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
back to the community

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,079
okay then a few few other things

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,639
on the on the service so the the

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,440
contribut besides contributions we also

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,880
asked people to provide their greatest

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
successes and challenges

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,040
and also the open open comments that

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
i'll explain

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,800
explain now and then we go to the cora

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,120
virus

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,399
so the greatest successes we got a lot

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,519
of these successes

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,680
uh and we selected the i would say

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,839
maybe maybe the best ones at least at

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,440
least the most representable

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,199
and those that that were sort of

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,320
tangible and universal

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,399
so somebody has been able to provide

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,680
drupal-based solutions for fortune 500

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,079
companies

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,519
this is really great because those are

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,759
the big guys

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,920
more sales and profit than ever before

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,800
big contracts increase our rates always

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,480
good that if you can increase your rates

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
of course without without losing your

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,839
customers that is that

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
just increasing rate is not always

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
enough

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
strong client relationship based on

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,000
positive solution results

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
increased average customer value

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,440
excellent

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,800
fast growth two big client wins

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,920
profitability targets for the first time

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,720
splash awards win growing the twice the

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,399
size

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
a lot of a lot of good stuff

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
and then the greatest challenges for the

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,079
past year was recruiting stuff this was

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,560
mentioned several times

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,759
we asked about the about the staff

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,000
recruiting but i decided to

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,800
cut it from this presentation because we

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
need to go

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
through the chronowatch situation also

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,199
but

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,199
the bottom line of recruiting was that

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,639
it's really really hard

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:46,320
and you can't find drupal talent

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,720
and the technology in drupal is

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,399
outdated and does not help you to

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
recruit people

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,040
those are the maybe maybe the top three

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
on top of my top of my head

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,199
brexit has been challenging for i guess

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
from for a uk company

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,319
somebody has been troubles with landing

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,919
triple aid work

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
maintaining balance between sales and

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
recruitment i would say that is that

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,360
that

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
problem never goes away you just need to

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
have a good enough pipeline that you can

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,760
foresee things

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
and forecast things not maybe 4c but

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,160
forecastings

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,600
and then have enough cash balances that

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
you can take to risks

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,559
with recruitment that if the some gig

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,840
doesn't land then then you are not

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
out of luck and need to get rid of the

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,000
people

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,840
drupal traction the market has declined

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,160
somebody is sort of going going

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,080
most of the people are so most of the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
companies are swimming upstream bigger

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,960
deals bigger cases

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,160
so forth so forth and this company is

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
going other way

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,039
on the downstream that the deal size and

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,720
the number of profits have gone down

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
you need to do something in that kind of

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,640
situation

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,559
whether the market is melting below you

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,559
or whether you are

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,640
having troubles with with your staff or

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,080
with your

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,160
competitors or whatever but at the end

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,799
this is something a time that you need

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,360
to react

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
unpredictability of demand quality of

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,720
manpower

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:30,720
both are solvable problems

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,720
the demand on predictability is about

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,280
building the sales pipeline that you

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,160
understand and see what what's going on

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,720
and you can make estimate estimations

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,640
really

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,880
good sales director for bigger companies

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
and

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
good sales guy for smaller companies

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
that knows the tricks and

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
knows how to estimate knows how to

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,799
forecast

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
and has that kind of hunch that that he

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
knows that okay

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
this amount of money i'm going to get

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,760
out of this

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
these prospects of this pipeline helps

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
you a lot

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,120
with the with the unpredictability of

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
demand if your demand is unpredictable

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,880
it also means

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,840
that you are not doing enough on sales

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
and marketing front

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,200
accenture and the other huge players

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,520
entering the market this validates that

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,640
the market is right

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,320
it also means for the smaller smaller

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
companies that you might be crushed by

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
the elephants

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,080
somebody has lost their biggest client

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,320
and that's that's always a sad situation

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,320
that that's always always terrifying and

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,000
that probably has happened more

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
with the coral virus we'll we'll come

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
back to that

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,880
and the greatest challenge for the same

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,880
company that this

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
great achievement was growing two times

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,640
is also the biggest challenge and i

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,640
can completely understand that

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,480
a few open comments from the from the

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
survey

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,400
from the business model side we got

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
plenty of comments and we have really

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
selected the

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,720
top of the top for these ones that

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,559
we could spend like two hours going

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
through the comments

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
there was so so good ones there that it

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,240
was this was really hard

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,120
hard job to make the make the selection

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,080
but the drupal is becoming a powerful

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,880
powerful platform

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,360
for the large enterprises and this means

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,720
that the

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,360
smaller agencies it's harder

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,559
to gather this growth and this is

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,080
understandable

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,520
in some markets the big companies are

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,400
afraid of talking with or engaging with

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,039
smaller clients

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
smaller vendors because they are not

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,720
sure whether

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,679
they can actually handle the burden that

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
they will

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,520
provide this despite the money being

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
good and so forth but they have also

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,919
demands and the others that might be

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,799
really hard for a small company

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:02,480
to deliver on time and on quality

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,760
and so forth teaming up

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
with with other companies maybe maybe

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,520
merchant acquisitions

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,280
help on those ones uh

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,120
many public sector cases for triple

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,360
eight

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
and then the people people or the

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
company that that company has formed a

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
special team to participate on those

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
contracts

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
really good move i think that the uh if

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,200
you agile

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
then you then you actually can make us

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
with changes most of the companies are

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
small

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,679
and you can you can work

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,679
work around the obstacles

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
then there's a this we saw a few times

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,960
that the

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,799
drupal 8 was not a good choice for most

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,039
of my current clients

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,840
and this shows that you

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,039
and your clients are not growing

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,840
together with drupal but you are serving

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
a market that will be gradually served

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,039
by wordpress

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:12,159
and then the software service platforms

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:15,600
so it's uh

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
it is something that it means at the end

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,919
that if i'm

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,320
brutally blunt and i'm a finnish guy so

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,480
i'm i'm

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
i'm honest to the bluntness let's put

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
this way

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
it means that you are in the wrong

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,240
market and you did

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,280
if you are not going up with

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,360
drupal to the bigger clients

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
then it's a wrong technology for you i

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,200
understand that if you have been growing

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,440
with that technology

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,520
spend a lot of time and blood and tears

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,960
and whatever sweat

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,960
on the on the community and the platform

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
it's sad to see that go somewhere else

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
and you want to go

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,480
but that's life that's business and you

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,159
need to make your choice

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,760
go to wordpress go to wix

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,440
or try to grow bigger clientele

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,280
or bigger size clients i would say

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,120
the middle is disappearing go big or go

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
home this is exactly the same thing

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,960
and then the technology skills

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,159
are still important even if the if the

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
uh

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
the technology is becoming more of

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,480
commodity

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
there still is it's still a critical

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,840
factor

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,039
and this was the comment of the year

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,799
that uh you need to go big

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:42,080
with drupal otherwise you won't have

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,240
big business at the end you will have a

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,240
tolerable business and then later

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,880
miserable business

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,679
and then no business if you if you don't

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
start to grow

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,400
with drupal

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,960
decoupled solutions this was mentioned

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,760
in increase note

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,360
more and more requirements nodejs

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,960
react.js

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,159
always discussed this was also in the

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
in the uh also at like the last last

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,080
comment here that the

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,760
jquery structure the front-end people

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,320
are not willing to work with jquery

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,080
anymore

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,080
they they feel that outdated we actually

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,400
lost one case when we said that the

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,200
this was probably simplest to implement

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,799
in jquery and said okay

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,760
the client client that was technology

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,559
company also told me that the

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,480
2010 caller called you and asked us to

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,520
get to get their stuff back

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,320
so the uh it would have been probably

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,880
three times more expensive it react

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
but that what the client actually wanted

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,200
because it's it's hip and cool

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,559
and my assumption is that the react will

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
be the next

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,440
job that kind of legacy stuff that is

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,120
everywhere and there is that you can

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,400
make

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,559
living until until you go to pension by

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,240
fixing legacy react application in the

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,000
future

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,840
but back to drupal again the larger

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
projects

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,720
you are too small the middle comment go

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,320
big or go home i'm

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,320
i can't really help you there

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,039
architects of best perspective freedom

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,039
it's uh

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,360
the this is crucial i would say that

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,200
this

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
is this is really really important that

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,320
the clients want to have things happen

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,640
and they they have been bound to number

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
of

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
platforms and they have learned the hard

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,919
way

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,840
that that the big corporations

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,679
microsoft's adobe's

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,520
oracles they want to tie them

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
with their processes their ways of

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,240
working

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,159
and it's not optimal because

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,400
every business different and then the

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,640
architectural freedom

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
is crucial and drupal can deliver that

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
if we

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
make it

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,559
as one of the one of the key messages

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
we could use that as that to to make

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
sure that people understand that drupal

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,640
is flexible as

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,520
stated in a few few slides back and it

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
allows

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,039
the active freedom but then you need to

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,720
have

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
senior level architects that can

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,760
actually talk with the senior level

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,480
architects on the other side

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,080
of the client side and go through the

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,080
demands because php

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,440
has a reputation of a toy language

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,840
and that's something that you need to

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
come over that obstacle to

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,720
sales side large organization

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,000
enterprises

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,919
drupal projects at scale that they

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,640
consolidate to one platform there has

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,640
been a lot of lot of companies

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
mentioned in in regionals and the others

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,279
that have been replacing

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
thousands hundreds or thousands of sites

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,720
with drupal

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,960
but it's still for the cms cms is just

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,480
the surface

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,520
the way bigger money lies beyond

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
those things what are the because the

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,480
cms is the gate

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,880
for uh end user to enter the

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
company they always come through their

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,880
website

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,960
our relationship that we start to work

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,159
more on the e-commerce we start to work

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
more on the

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,120
application side because drupal has

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,480
those capabilities not everything is

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,240
top notch but it has those capabilities

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,279
and it has

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,799
i would say a reputation

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:50,799
of reliability and the security

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,799
that we can build the story on

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,679
competition has been bigger

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,640
and they market themselves better this

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,919
is always

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,559
you should always remember that

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,720
the best technology never wins the best

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,799
people never win

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,320
it's always the best marketers that win

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,520
oracle has never provided the best

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,600
best of breed software they it's it's

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,720
good the oracle software has been always

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
good i don't

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,360
say that but they have had excellent

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,440
excellent marketing

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,799
and that's why how they have won a

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
number of things and the

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,720
other guys could have been way better in

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,320
from technology perspective

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
but they have lost because of oracle's

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,000
marketing

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,000
so if you can't present

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,799
yourself better than your competition

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,799
that is average

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,279
please get a good

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,000
marketing and sales people that can

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,279
present you better

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
because if you

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,200
if you get the presentation right and

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
you are better in techno says then you

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,039
will win

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,039
you will win the competitors every

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,919
single time

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,559
and adding that person finding a good

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,520
person it's

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,159
hard to find a good person that is that

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,320
understand enough of the technology

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,919
while being a good marketer but those

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,880
people do exist

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,320
i won on my team i don't tell her name

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,840
to you because i want to keep

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,440
her and my team but

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:40,000
it's crucial to present your company

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,080
as the winner

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,399
uh then there's the function of the

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,720
complete with our open side core

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,840
b2b and e-commerce positions and so for

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,120
density

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,000
that the the drupal story in my

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,960
own thinking is tilted too much on the

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,039
experiences

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,799
and that's about the content and how to

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,600
deliver content

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,200
and experience through the content and

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,520
not the

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,360
that is not where the money is made the

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,480
money is made

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,440
somewhere else and that's typically

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,080
where the

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,480
end user interact and transact

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,720
with the company not when they read the

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,840
content when they have the experiences

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,240
and i think that we should focus more

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,080
on the transactional part because drupal

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,320
is transactional engine

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
besides being a content engine and

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,760
that's something that is missing from

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,279
folks in the sitecore

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,279
they just don't have a good story for

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,360
that

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:47,039
so you need to find the strengths

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,720
of the platform to talk to your clients

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,960
if you just position yourself against

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,919
sitecore andrew adobe

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,200
on clients terms then the chances are

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,960
that you are going to lose because

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,080
sitecore adobe has fed the client

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,039
the terms and the ideas and you a

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,880
smaller guy

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:10,000
having more problem so again

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,320
more proactiveness there

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,039
so this survey data was from

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,240
2019 and since then we all know that the

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,679
situation has changed a bit and in some

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,399
areas a lot and

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,399
this has had effects on drupal companies

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:36,399
so we made two other surveys

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,159
quite quite short notice on this year

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,720
one on the end of march and beginning of

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,519
april we got 50 responses

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,399
and then there's a currently running one

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,080
i opened it

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,880
on tuesday and now

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
got 32 responses this morning when i

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,960
made these slides

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
so if you

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,200
are able to send

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
send your own opinions then please you

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,760
need your input to the second server it

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,000
will be open for a while

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
and then i'll show the major findings

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,360
from this service

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,519
this is something that has not been

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,640
discussed ever before

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,320
in public we had for the march

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,519
we had a webinar to go through the

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,840
results

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,919
but the july results of course if they

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,120
they were analyzed this morning they are

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,559
they are brands bank york

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,799
so a few questions that the how the

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,799
business has changed in general to the

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,919
epidemic this is the april

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,519
april figure and this is july figure the

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,399
here's the key so in april

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,919
people were thinking that almost half of

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,240
the people were think that

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,600
it will weaken or has already weak and

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
significant that they were

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,279
there were companies that had lost

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,640
not only their clients that went in

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,880
bankrupt but they have lost

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,279
also the last month's invoicing

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,519
so they have invoiced the clients they

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,799
have didn't pay the invoices yet

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
then happened the virus declined went to

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,279
bankruptcy

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,039
and couldn't pay so you lose like the

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,519
past month current month and then the

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,960
upcoming months in a single blow

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:26,000
and that's really really harsh

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,000
so when we compare these two figures

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,919
together you can see that then it was

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,399
like 10 percent or less

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,440
that say that it has grown and now it's

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,880
25.

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,159
so we are going the right direction

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,039
as a business community and the project

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,320
situation

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,840
has had i would say even a bit

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,480
better better better situation not maybe

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,320
maybe the change is the same around that

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,240
and then the

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,559
we can significantly has

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,880
dropped from the both of these answers

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,240
so it's

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,840
it's less severe and it affects less

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
companies but it's still severe

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,280
the revenue impact of the epidemic was

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,079
back then that there was the the weight

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,280
was more on the on the red side

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,720
that there was some companies that

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,040
thought that there's those

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,560
we are okay maybe one-fourth of the

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,599
companies

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,879
but now the those that have

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,800
actually had plus

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,720
10 revenue impact

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,200
the uh they are

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,960
they there's way more than than earlier

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,440
time there was a good comment on day on

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,320
day

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,960
on the from dave in the in the chat that

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,879
the uh

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,520
the most several hit possesses might be

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,240
around anymore and that's true

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,000
but back then they were there a few of

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,079
those

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,320
and what i saw from the figures that

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,040
some of them are still in business

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,320
but yes that is a is one way to go but i

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,960
haven't heard

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,800
any bigger closures of of drupal

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,440
agencies if you have then then please

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,880
post in the chat that we we all know

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,720
but it for me it feels

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,520
that the after the initial shock

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,880
we have recovered as a business

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,280
community

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,960
i didn't analyze didn't have time to

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,240
analyze the that whether there is a

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
difference between the

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,680
continents because in the last analysis

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,760
in march or april

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,440
uh europe was seeing things way more

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,839
positive than the states

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,520
and then it was time that the states

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,119
didn't have the outbreak yet

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,000
new york happened after that survey

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,560
so uh it would be interesting that i'll

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
i'll

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,200
probably check those those and maybe we

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,320
do a separate webinar later in august or

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,280
something like that

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,920
about the about these new results no

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,000
promises yet because the uh

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,520
still still everybody needs to need to

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
focus on their own businesses on these

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
times but

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,599
if we have time i measure will might do

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,440
something

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,680
but these numbers are more positive than

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,320
i

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,440
expected so i'm i'm truly glad

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,320
i'm glad about the situation and then if

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,000
we take a look at the sales pipeline

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,119
there was like one sixth or sorry one

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,720
one third two thirds of of people were

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,240
saying that the sales pipeline

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,720
has gone worse during the day and we can

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,760
see

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,760
significantly and now people record back

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,240
that they have

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,200
they have got alternative sources of

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,000
income

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
they have got

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,760
different different uh ways and the new

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,040
new kind of clients

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,800
and they have been doing a bit different

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,240
kind of stuff for the current clients

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,400
and the current clients have been

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,400
accelerated investments and so forth so

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,560
for those government grants whatever

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,800
there's a lot of different ways to do it

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,960
but this is really heartwarming that

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,640
that we have been able as a business

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,160
community

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:22,480
reduce the reduce the amount

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,280
of of the weakening of the of the

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,800
pipeline prospecting is still

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
challenging

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,520
it's still to be said that the prospect

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,520
has not changed that much

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,839
it's more positive than it used to be

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,560
uh it's uh it's not not easy and there's

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,000
still certain areas or certain companies

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,200
that have a lot of troubles

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,280
troubles with the with the uh

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,520
with the sales prospecting so this is

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,720
something that you need to spend time

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,000
a lot of time these days to make make

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,440
sure that you can actually have the

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
pipeline

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,400
in proper order

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
the cash flow

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:19,839
expected that it will weaken

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:33,839
that often

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,280
of sales usable to the current clients

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,920
you

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,520
can survive without cash that if you

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,480
don't get cash in

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,160
then you are bankruptcy in really short

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,119
time surprisingly short time

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,119
even if you have

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,440
uh projects ongoing and also it's doing

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,200
good but if you don't get the cash in

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
the clients are not paying or something

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,160
like that then you are in deep

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,760
troubles very very quickly and this is

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,880
good that we see that

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,119
it has changed so tremendously

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,560
uh and then we also the last question

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,880
that what we asked for the company was

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,400
that what is the probable outcome

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,240
and in april it was like

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,800
uh almost two thirds say that they will

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,440
that we will survive but we will get

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
dense

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
and now it like and then one third today

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,800
that we will do fine

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,720
now it's like the opposite that the

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,079
majority of the drupal combats are

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,320
thinking that they do will do fine and

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,320
then

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,880
mine already will think that they will

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,400
get dense and then there was the one

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,880
company

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,880
that decided that they will they will

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,160
a liquid white themselves because of

00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,359
their being

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,119
in the risk group and these kind of

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,040
things and that was great decision i'm

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,760
not sure whether that's the same company

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,079
july version but i'll i'll see that

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,079
later

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,240
because that means that they haven't yet

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,119
leaked to fight themselves and that's

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,119
also good news

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,280
so general feedback

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,880
the there were slowdown already

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,040
happening before the before the current

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,760
virus and now there's a lot of money

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,520
being pumped on the markets

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,520
so and a lot of that money is going to

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,440
be invested in digital because a lot of

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,040
our clients have found out

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:45,280
that if this kind of thing hits the fan

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,920
then the they need to have these

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,920
solutions

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,960
the last one is really crucial that we

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,920
as a business leaders we need to support

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,560
each other because

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,880
this is really lonely job to be at the

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,520
top of the company

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,480
it's very very lonely so we need to rely

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:09,119
on each other's

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,160
a few recommendations to to close the

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,240
session

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,440
uh the middle is disappearing go big or

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,160
go home

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,880
the small end have been gone for years

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,480
now

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,240
the middle one is disappearing too

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,480
you need to rebuild your company for the

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,079
enterprise and or disruptors so you need

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,119
to find the areas

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,200
where you can grow

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,200
invest in sales and marketing that's

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,520
what we always said

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,560
for the current virus always plan for

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
the future

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,760
whether it's good or bad whether you see

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,480
the future bleak or

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,760
big or bright you are always better off

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,359
when you have prepared for it

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,240
you have a major scenarios all these

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,560
kind of things

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,560
and digital services will ju the need

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,359
for the digital service will search

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,240
after the car virus so stay alive and

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,240
reap the benefits

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,640
and then we always always end this with

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,440
the with the

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,960
small fable and this is this was 2019

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,400
fable but it's still

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,079
still uh very very very

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,560
timely so you can think

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,400
your company as hair that is protected

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,480
by their agility that they can

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,720
go to different direction really quickly

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,760
or a tortoise that is protected by their

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,599
shells

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,160
both are good ways but when we

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,240
start to cross the chasm from the early

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,800
adopters to the enterprise

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
or we cross the chasm of coronavirus

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,680
that

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,880
things didn't go as we planned

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,400
then the agility

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,400
is our friend being protected by doing

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,880
things same way

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,160
as always and protected by that we just

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,839
protect ourselves

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,400
you are not going to go go anywhere

00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,560
so whether you are going to be a hero a

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,480
tortoise that's your decision

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,920
but i strongly success that you consider

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
being here and be agile

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,480
so that's it that's what i got

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,160
if you have any questions then then chat

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,800
is your friend

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,839
also the evaluation is evaluation link

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,880
is top of the chat

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:27,839
i would be pretty pleased to get

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,839
evaluation of from all of you

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,960
you

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,560
also in chapter what's up from aaron

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,880
hello if you are there

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,280
uh that you don't get better tech sales

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,520
people you create them and that's

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,520
a good way to say it of course if you

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
can recruit

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,800
somebody that is good from the start and

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,880
then you

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,880
then you help them to understand drupal

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,440
it's the

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,640
journey to have a text good texans

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,920
people

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,440
is shorter that the experience counts

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,000
even if it comes from a bit different

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,000
technology

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,440
and then pews

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,640
was asking the maintaining balance

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,240
between sales and recruitment

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,720
some proven solutions this is hard my i

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,720
we haven't cracked it right at excel yet

00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,920
we have been doing that for 14 years or

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
something like that

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,359
and it's still not right the problem is

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,160
to find

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:41,440
the right indications or the signals

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,200
that went to recruit we have learned

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,240
that how long does it take to recruit

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,079
and we have been

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,920
having a constant recruiting that we

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,119
have been talking with people and we are

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,880
always recruiting

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,960
even if you are not hiring and

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,880
and then we then we have a pool of

00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,960
people that we can come back to

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,760
if needed that have shown interest to us

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,160
the other side of this one is that if

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,119
you can reduce your hiring needs

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,160
by reducing the staff's churn then you

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,200
are way

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,000
better off immediately because then you

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,000
don't need to

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,280
hire for replacements that you can hire

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,280
only for growth

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,839
it's not that simple to just keep the

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,440
people and sometimes you need to

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,240
get rid of some people that are not

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,240
performing well

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,560
and then still ask that will there be

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,560
another presentation of the results of

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,560
the latest show when it closes that is a

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,359
good question i don't know yet

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,520
hopefully there will be and we will

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,680
inform that in the

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,119
in the drupal slack there's a ceo

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,720
channel on this business channel i'm

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,800
using both of them to inform and then

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,880
there's a drupal ceo slack

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,960

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,680

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,079
tell about these things i would

00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,200
