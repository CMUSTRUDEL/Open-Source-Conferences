	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
dive in and get started

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,000
before we begin i wanted to note two

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
things

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,599
uh one um as we're

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
sharing for those if you if you're not

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,720
aware of it

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
i think in most browsers you can double

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,359
click on one of the

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
things within the video and it will

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
enlarge it

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
i would encourage you to double click on

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
the slides being presented and not on

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,840
our faces

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,120
um but it's up to you um but it'll be

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
especially helpful

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
in the second uh more exciting half of

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
this talk when i turn it over to jen and

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
she's actually sharing some of the

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,559
design work i think you'll want to

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,239
double click so you get a good uh size

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
view of it as you can

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,680
um the other thing to note at least that

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm aware of uh

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
two other things actually uh one is uh

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
there's a

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
survey monkey link uh that's provided

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
early on in the chat and i think we'll

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
we'll duplicate it again at the end of

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
this session uh

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
into the chat uh and drupalcon really

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,239
appreciates getting feedback on the

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
sessions as do we because they share

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
some of it with us i think at least they

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,479
have in the past

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,000
um so please if you have time uh

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,000
give us some thoughts and lastly i think

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
we're going to try to seed questions as

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
it goes along we'll see how that works

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,600
one way to make it a little easier is if

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
you're providing a question in the

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
middle of the talk as it comes to your

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
mind

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,159
uh into the chat if you could just

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,320
proceed your question with the letter q

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
colon and then the question so it'll

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
make it a little easier for us to scan

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
through and see if there are

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
questions that people have added so jen

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
was there anything else that i was

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
supposed to cover before we actually

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
dive in

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,159
no i think that's it

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,200
okay well let me make sure my

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
everything is working here for my slides

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
and we'll we'll

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
dive in so thanks for coming everyone

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
uh if you're not sure what this uh

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,600
session is

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
this is uh designing for chaos which is

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,360
essentially the

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
story behind the design process for aloe

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
vera which

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,319
is the new uh the new theme being

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
developed for drupal the new default

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,720
theme

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,160
so there was another session this

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
morning uh

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,760
two other of our colleagues uh putra

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,879
uh bona corsi and mike herschel gave a

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
session that

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
was more focused on the development

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
process and and

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
uh so i would encourage you if you

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
missed that to try to try to find that

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
out but um

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
i think these will be available after

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,080
fingers crossed so

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,720
um but yeah let's get started um

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
like i said i'm i'm jared uh or if you

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
were here earlier during

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
intros uh my name is jared ponchat uh

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,120
this is

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,160
jen watkowski as well um

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
say hi to jen uh we uh we've worked

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
together

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,599
at lullabot now for several years we're

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,879
both designers at lullabot um

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,840
and we both have been have spent years

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,800
uh doing uh design projects at lullabots

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
we do ux and ui design work for

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,280
uh large-scale drupal projects and

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,480
um often sort of larger design systems

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
uh kinds of projects but lolabot is a

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
company that's been around in the drupal

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
space for a long long time now since the

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,319
very early days

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
uh of drupal and uh if you're not

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
familiar with us

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
uh come check us out or say hello at our

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
booth during some of the booth times

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
there's a number of lullabots that hang

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
out there

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
um but yeah lulabot does strategy design

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,319
development stuff and so we work

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
kind of in a client services mode i

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,840
joined

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,080
uh lulabot uh in about i think it was

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,239
2010 which is a decade ago now

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
which is kind of hard to believe and i

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
remember

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,879
at the time that i joined lulabot um i

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
also uh

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,239
was uh came across jen simmons i

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,439
met her through a thing early on there

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
would blow about had this sort of

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
trainers at large thing at the time

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,000
lulabot was doing a lot of drupal

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
training and we both had applied into

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
that

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
jen simmons was helping uh drupal at the

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
time

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,400
uh with a project called bartik uh if

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
you're not familiar with bartik

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
it has been a part of drupal for a long

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
time now uh when i joined lulabot in

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,840
april of 2010

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
she was maybe two months into this

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,320
process and

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,880
of creating bartik which was uh the sort

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,199
of

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
default theme for drupal now for a

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,639
decade uh

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,080
uh jumping ahead a little bit

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,720
um the i just before i before i talk

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
about

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
what mike and putra began now i forgot

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
to mention

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
like there's a number of people who

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
worked on bartek over the years and

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
it was around for a decade served a lot

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
of people very well

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
i'd be curious if in the chat if you're

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
somebody

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
that actually worked on bartik at some

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,720
point maybe

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
raise your hand somehow through chat or

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
something i'd love to see how many

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
people

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
uh that are at the session that actually

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
had a hand in bartik but

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
for all of you who did thank you the

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
it's quite a feat to make something

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,720
that'll last for 10 years

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,000
um and uh so

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,759
how did we get to where we are now uh

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
there are other people who led the

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,320
groundwork for what jen and i are gonna

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
talk about

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,000
uh our colleagues putra bonacorsi and

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
mike herschel

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
uh had the sort of germ of the idea for

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
this and it happened

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
at drupalcon seattle last year uh i

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
think

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
if i'm getting the story right they were

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
hanging out in the lobby and ended up

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,840
talking with angie byron

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
and uh lowry escola i may be saying that

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
larry's name wrong if so i apologize if

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
i'm mispronouncing

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,160
uh but they had a whole uh conversation

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,400
in the hotel lobby at drupalcon seattle

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
uh about sort of what constitutes a

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
great cms theme

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
and that cons that conversation led

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
putra and mike to wonder

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
at the fact that there was no current

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,360
project

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
for creating a new drupal core theme

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
with drupal 9

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,440
and so they started stewing on that

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
also at drupalcon seattle dries

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,039
mentioned

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
in his keynote there that while experts

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,880
still

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,720
love drupal um beginners or cms

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,000
newcomers still have some negative

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
connotations

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
and a key driver of that negative

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,360
sentiment is that

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
out of the box experience the fact that

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,919
it includes a theme

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,800
design that's now a decade old so

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,160
putra and mike started creating a few

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
initial goals that they had

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,520
things that made them interested in

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,400
working on it things like

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,919
an updated modern design uh they wanted

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
a theme that felt more current

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,639
potentially for the next

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
five years is kind of the way it's been

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
talked about how we're thinking

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
uh we're hoping it doesn't have to last

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
as long as bartik did

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
but a functionality that supports new

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
features so they wanted the theme to

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,039
support commonly used drupal

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
functionality like

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,160
second level navigation and embedded

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,440
media layout builder and so on

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,080
and then lastly uh wakag

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,319
however you're supposed to say the wcag

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
double a conformance uh they wanted the

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
theme to be

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,520
compliant and to ensure that it passes

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,160
drupal's stringent accessibility

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,440
standards with flying colors

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,880
so um putra and mike uh

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
actually gave a talk right before us as

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
i mentioned today if you didn't catch

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
that hopefully you'll be able to find it

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280
after

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,039
also putra wrote an article about the

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,720
genesis of this whole thing as well it's

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
on lullabot.com

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
if you want to find that just go to

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,160
bitly dot

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,840
so bitly slash aloe vera

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,120
d9 and you can find her article

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,960
okay so once putra and mike decided to

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
try to take on this project it was at

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,479
this point that they began looking to

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
assemble a team to work on it and they

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
reached out to jen

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,360
who mentioned it to me and then we got

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,960
to pretend like we knew what we were

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
doing as we began the process of

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,840
designing a new drupal theme

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,720
so in this talk what we're going to try

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,759
to answer is just a handful of things

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,800
who are we why did we do this

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,960
how did we do this and what specifically

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
would you say we did here

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
so uh you're already right here that's

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
the good news we're going to get into

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,479
the meat pretty quickly here

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
um and uh hopefully we'll have some time

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,759
for questions at the end because we'll

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
move kind of quickly through some high

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,280
level stuff

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
and leave open slots for open space for

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,919
questions

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,200
so um let's see

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,440
the challenges of designing a cms theme

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,880
i want to start by framing some of these

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
challenges that actually we weren't

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
necessarily that familiar with because

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,360
like i said a lot of the work we do

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,000
uh is sort of very specific design work

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
for clients um designing a cms theme was

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
a unique thing

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
we had to figure out two uh sort of key

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
questions and these are

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
key questions for any design project

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,040
i've ever done really and that's

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
who is our audience and who are our

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
stakeholders

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,240
they're the fundamental things for any

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
design process and the work that jen and

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,839
i

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,200
uh do typically it typically provides

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,680
pretty clear answers to these these

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
aren't

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,640
the hard questions um when you're

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,480
designing a theme that anyone can use

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,080
for nearly any kind of site

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,839
that they're making with an open source

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
cms how you define things like your

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
audience uh

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
and designing and feedback and approval

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
processes

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,640
uh is actually really tricky so

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
how you solve for this can create whole

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
new problems as well that's kind of what

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
we discovered as we started hashing out

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,399
how we were going to do this

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,240
and there are two potentially alluring

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
approaches to these problems that are

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,880
actually

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,399
themselves problematic and that's what

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,440
we worked to avoid

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,640
so the first problematic approach to

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
this is just

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
include everything for everyone thereby

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,360
making something that's unwieldy and

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
unusable for everyone

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,320
uh and you just can't include everything

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,800
the needs are too varied with something

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,800
like a cms

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
we wanted to have some kind of focus

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
intent and opinion as we created

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
because we just knew we weren't going to

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,320
be able to make something that does

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,800
everything for everyone

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,160
the second problematic approach is to

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,720
design for the average

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
and thereby uh sort of wind up designing

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
for no one specifically

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,800
um this is sometimes referred to as the

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,560
average man problem if if you're not

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
familiar with this back in world war

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
ii we came to grips with the fact that

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
the us military had spent

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,120
decades uh designing and building

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,800
airplane cockpits

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
and controls for what it called the

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
average man

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,760
uh there's a really long backstory to

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,839
this that goes

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,440
way back to the origins of astronomy

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,040
and traces through the american civil

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,040
war if you're into those kinds of things

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
there's a great episode of the podcast

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,720
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
invisible called on average that tells

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
that story

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
but the gist of it is by world war ii

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
what

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
our military began realizing was that

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
they had been taking average

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,040
measurements for air force pilots

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,959
and sizing everything based on averages

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,560
so things like height weight arm length

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,240
etc

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,600
and what it turned what turned out to be

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
true was that

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
no one pilot actually matched any of

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
these averages

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
so planes were crashing it was really

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
difficult

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,519
in this realization people dying in

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
crashes due to unwilling cockpits led to

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
the design thinking behind modern

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
cockpits where you have things like

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,959
adjustable seats adjustable yokes pedals

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
and whatnot

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,240
so we kind of took some inspiration for

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
what came out of that in designing aloe

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
vera

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
we also had to work to figure out what

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,600
features and controls needed to be

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519
adjustable if you will

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
so what was our approach jen's going to

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,440
get more into specifics in terms of the

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,360
things that we actually did

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,800
but at a really high level i want to try

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,639
to frame our approach and philosophy so

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
first we established some design

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
principles and this helped us define

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
success in a way that was easy to

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,279
remember

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,240
and could kind of hold true even as we

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
learned more

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,399
about both our audience and our

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,600
stakeholders throughout the process

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,440
so our principles were that above all

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
we wanted to design something that was

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
simple we wanted to avoid unnecessary

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,160
visual elements

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
colors effects complexity we wanted to

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
be modern

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
we wanted to take advantage of the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
capabilities and strengths of modern

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
browsers and interaction patterns

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
turns out browsers and front-end

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
development have changed a bit over 10

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
years of bartik

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
we wanted to make something that was

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
focused and this meant things

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
like embracing high contrast saturated

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
color

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
negative space to draw the eye to what's

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
most important

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,279
and we tried to sort of design for the

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,600
design defaults within the theme

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,360
for the 80 so what are the things that

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,079
we can know are true of most

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,760
and really bring focus to those and

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
lastly flexible

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
we wanted to provide options and

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,839
overrides to account for varied needs

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,800
and preferences

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,519
so we then worked to zero in on what we

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
could say

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,399
about our audience and that their sites

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,160
uh the people who would use this theme

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,880
and when you're designing a default

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
theme for an open source cms like i said

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,519
there's an

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
ocean of things that you just can't know

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,040
about the people who will use it and the

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
sites that they'll create

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,399
but there were a few things we felt were

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,399
safe to say um

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,519
these are largely people who are new to

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,680
drupal um

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
the default theme ends up being used by

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
people who are giving who are kicking

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,680
the tires on drupal

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
these people may not have programming or

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
design skills

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,199
because often if you do you're in the

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,279
process of making a theme not using the

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,079
default theme

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,240
because of this there these people also

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,720
may have simpler content models uh

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
using just the core content types are

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
not doing a lot of like heavy lifting on

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,399
really complex models

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
so it needed to serve the base types

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,880
really well

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,120
and despite things like uh the

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
simplicity of the content model of

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,279
quadruple

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,639
um we also knew that the content itself

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,040
will vary widely

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
things like lengths of titles and labels

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
and things like that

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,920
uh there needed to be a lot of

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,720
flexibility within the theme

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
so next we work to try to figure out who

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
are our stakeholders

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,079
how do you do a project like this um we

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
needed to answer questions like

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,800
who are our stakeholders who's going to

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,360
provide the feedback and when and how

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,199
and what do we want from them what kind

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,519
of feedback are we looking for

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,399
and what should approval look like who

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,680
will approve

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,360
which designs and how

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
i already mentioned the challenge we had

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
of our real stakeholders being lots of

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,320
people who may eventually use this theme

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,160
and a broad drupal community who cares a

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
lot about it in many cases

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,680
but we needed some sort of approach to

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,120
reigning that in a bit

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,279
so our approach was to to first

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,199
establish a proxy group we assembled a

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
group of various core maintainers

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,959
as well as our team of designers and

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,720
developers working on the project

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,320
that we could use initially to help

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
begin the review and

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,079
review and refinement process and the

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
goal here was to do as much due

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
diligence as possible

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
to sort of weed out as many potential

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,320
problems and issues with our design

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
ideas as possible quickly so that we

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,120
could put something

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,240
a bit more solid in front of the larger

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
community for feedback

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
we next we tested and continued to

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
iterate and we did this a lot we had a

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
lot of help from our proxy group with

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,079
things like accessibility

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,199
accessibility testing along the way so

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,040
that we were able to do a lot of

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,759
refinement sort of weeding out these

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
problems

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,680
uh and not wasting the broader

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,240
community's time on things that

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
we could quickly solve so other examples

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
of things that changed a lot along the

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,519
way through

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,079
iteration uh even changed since we

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
finalized

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,440
the designs and the real development

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
process began

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
more design changes came in for things

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,519
like

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,720
initially we had a style that used

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
uppercase labeling

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,519
and it was for things like the rss feed

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,160
label or the share labels or things like

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
that

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,759
but because these things would be

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
flexible and could be overridden and

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
also maybe localized to lots of

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,880
different languages

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,639
we decided that we couldn't guarantee

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
conciseness in them and therefore

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,199
uppercase was not a great idea

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,680
things like the color palette evolved a

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,360
bit as we continued to test and hone and

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,279
refine for accessibility

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
things like form states and all the

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,360
varied states

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
refined and refined and refined some

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,240
more to get them to where they were

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,440
both accessible and felt visually clear

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
and within the

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
language of the design

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,959
we knew we wanted to eventually engage

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,880
the broader community for feedback so we

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
did some work to define the kind of

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
feedback we were looking for

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
and what our timeline targets would be

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,959
to help give people deadlines for

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
providing feedback

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,560
once we'd done a good bit of refinement

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
in the design process and design the

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
kind of feedback we were looking

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
for from the broader community we

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,600
published our process and those

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,520
guidelines on drupal.org

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,839
and we continued our refinement process

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,439
based on uh the broader community's

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,199
feedback and one thing that

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,439
felt like a success at least to me i

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
think to gen 2 was that that community

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
feedback did not

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
feel like an overwhelming onslaught

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,079
there wasn't a

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
just a slew of problems and bugs and

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
complaints that was unbearable

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,840
the community provided some really great

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
insights and helped catch a few things

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,200
that had been missed but it felt like

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,400
the work we had done with the proxy

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
group was really effective

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,799
okay so that's a super high level

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,360
flyover of sort of our approach

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,080
philosophy the sort of underlying

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,400
architecture

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,400
of the process and now

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,320
we're going to jump into jen getting

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
into some more details she's going to

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,600
talk about some things like

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
how did we identify the look and feel

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,440
that we wanted to achieve how did we

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
collaborate to refine and establish that

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
look and feel and

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
even better what were what were those

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
designs like along the way what do

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
things look like so

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
she is going to join us now and i will

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,440
take a back seat

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,559
and enjoy the show hey everybody

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
um so if you want to click on my slide

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,360
deck

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
um to make it large that would be

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,160
fantastic

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,760
um so uh i'm gonna just a heads up i'm

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,640
gonna switch between

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
um keynote here and figma so they'll be

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
like

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
a quick second where that you'll see

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,160
nothing before i switch over to figma

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,720
because i'm gonna use figma to walk

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,760
through uh all of our designs

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,799
um so i'm going to talk about

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,600
the design process for aloe vera

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,000
um basically i'd love to walk you

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
through

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,080
how we approach the visual exploration

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,600
and how we finalize the design

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,120
system uh but before we begin uh

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,960
before i begin talking a little bit

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,760
about the design process

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,200
um i want to talk a little bit about how

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
we answered the question

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,760
what are we designing we basically had

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,919
to figure out what the theme had to do

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,160
before we actually started visual

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
exploration

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
so it was important for us to understand

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
the scope and restrictions of the

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,480
project

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
and what we could change versus what was

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,280
nice to have

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
versus things we really couldn't change

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,799
at all um

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
and we worked really closely with mike

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,400
and putra to achieve this who were

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
our main developers so what we did is we

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,720
started off with bartik as a base and we

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
created a list that captured all the

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
components in bartek

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and then reviewed them with my computra

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
to fully understand

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
what we could change versus things that

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
we really couldn't touch

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,640
um and we also captured all the

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
different ways that the components could

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,080
appear

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
so this is what this process kind of

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
looked like um

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
so basically we went through bartik uh

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
we captured screenshots

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,000
uh we added details uh my computer added

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,400
comments and we went back and forth

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
um as you can see it was nothing fancy

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
uh we basically used a paper

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,480
dock but this whole process helped us

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
better understand what we were designing

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
for

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,600
and once we felt like we had this in a

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,080
good spot and we both understood

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
what we needed to design we created

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,760
really quick wireframes to review

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,679
with developers to ensure that we had

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,679
captured all the really important bits

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,039
so once we felt like we were in a really

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,520
good place with the component

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,640
documentation

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,559
we were able to start the visual phase

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
one thing to note is that we were

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,960
working with stakeholders

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
that were across multiple time zones and

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,559
who

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,120
already pretty uh had pretty full days

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,200
we also had a really aggressive timeline

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,960
so we had to shorten the visual research

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,480
phase by prioritizing what the big

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
questions were

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,000
and limiting the amount of design

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,000
reviews we had with stakeholders

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
so the big question that we had that we

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
needed

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
stakeholders to answer was what should

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
the new theme

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,039
look like um so what we did is we worked

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
closely with our stakeholders at jared

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,720
reviewed

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,799
to help answer this question we didn't

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,679
have a lot of time to spend on answering

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,080
this question

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,720
so what we did is we created a single

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,360
exercise called the spectrum analysis

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
exercise where stakeholders could go in

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,280
and complete it on their own time

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
by a specific due date that we had set

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,320
so you may be asking yourself well what

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,640
is a spectrum analysis exercise

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,799
so it's an exercise that our team uses

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
to help figure out um what the client is

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,880
thinking when it comes to the voice and

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
tone

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,960
of a theme or design so what you

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
do is you create a scale and on one end

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
is an adjective

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
that could describe the look and feel of

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,240
a site or in this case the theme

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,000
and then on the other end is another

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
adjective that usually conflicts with

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
the first

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,919
so as you see here you have formal and

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
casual

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,679
um stakeholders then go in and put a

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
point on the scale

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,960
and how they think the design should

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
look and feel

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
once that point is created we then open

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
it up for discussion and ask a bunch of

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,559
questions so we can fully understand

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,799
uh the thoughts and intentions behind

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,799
why they put that point specifically at

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,880
that place on the scale

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
and since we couldn't do this in person

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,480
what we did is we used envision

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,000
to to complete this exercise

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,559
and we felt it worked really great

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,400
because you could use envisions comment

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,360
functionality to create the point on the

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
scale

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
stakeholders could leave comments

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
explaining their

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,039
uh reasoning behind why they put that

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,799
point on that specific place and then we

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,159
could ask questions and even other

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,159
stakeholders can chime in

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,280
so based on the spectrum analysis we had

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,600
identified the following keywords to

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,400
help establish our voice and tone

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
so we have formal light and bright

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,880
contemporary

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,440
professional approachable novel

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,520
cool familiar and high contrast

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,520
so we took those adjectives and combined

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,679
them with our design principles in order

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,600
to complete our design documentation

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
so as i mentioned our design research

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
phase was pretty short because we didn't

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
have a lot of time

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
but we felt like we had enough

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,280
information to move forward

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
uh and start exploring visual approaches

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,600
uh one thing to note too um is that our

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
team tries to keep the design principles

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,080
and adjectives in front of mind

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,880
so we'll use uh things like note cards

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
post-its

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
whiteboards vision boards to help remind

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,279
us of the design principles and the

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,039
voice and tone while exploring

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,039
different visual approaches so my

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,480
personal favorite is post-its so when

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,919
i'm working on a visual approach i'll

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
have all different types of post-its

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,080
around my screen to kind of help remind

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
me

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,960
of the adjectives that i'm supposed to

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
be designing for

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,559
so now came to the visual exploration

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,480
phase

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,320
and our team uses something called the

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,159
zoo mox to explore different visual

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,720
approaches to visual design

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,960
and zoom locks are an alternative um to

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
style tiles basically

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,120
so specifically what they are is

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,600
basically you choose a wireframe

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,840
and then you kind of zoom in and choose

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,679
a small section of that wire frame

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,919
and then you start exploring style in

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,240
that specific section

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,000
we created two to four zoom marks um

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,559
each representing a completely different

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
style

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,760
or variations in a specific style

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,600
and to learn more about zumax um there's

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,360
an article that i wrote that gets a bit

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,320
more specific about what they are

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
and how to use them

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,559
so these are some of the zoom mocks that

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,720
we have created

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,400
um so we explored approaches that were a

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,440
bit more traditional like the one you

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,120
see on the left

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,640
and ones that were a bit more modern

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,400
like you see on the right

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,919
um when we felt like these were in a

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,279
good spot we shared them with our

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
stakeholders

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,960
and they helped choose an approach for

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,880
us to move forward with with some you

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,120
know small minor revisions

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,120
uh one thing to note too is our team

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,559
wasn't looking for an official sign off

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,400
of yes this is the finalized style

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,240
we would have been in a much larger

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,679
feedback loop that the timeline really

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,279
didn't account for

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
um what we were looking from our

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,120
stakeholders was more of

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
this is good this is going in the right

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,200
direction let's keep moving forward

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,960
um with the understanding that the

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,520
design will evolve and change

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,720
as we extend the design system to other

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
pages and components

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
so once we had our zoom mox complete it

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,559
was uh time to start thinking about the

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,039
design system itself

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,480
and um before i get into that though i

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,520
just wanted to mention some of the tools

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,799
that we had used

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,640
to design aloe vera so the main ux ui

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,039
tool that we had used

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,799
was figma and figma allowed us to

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
collaborate and share progress much more

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,360
quickly between jared and i

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
um share progress with our developers

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,559
and also share progress with our

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,039
stakeholders

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
we used zoom for conference calls where

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,880
we could

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,279
share work we used slack for really

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,000
quick

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,919
chatting back and forth we used dropbox

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
paper for informal notes and then we

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,720
used google docs for more formal

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,000
documentation

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,760
like our design system documentation

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
also just want to reinstate some of the

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,400
challenges that we had to keep in mind

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,039
while we were

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,520
designing aloe vera um as jared had

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
mentioned

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,159
accessibility was one of our main

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,200
priorities um the theme had to be wcag

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,880
double a accessible and in order to do

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,720
this we had to make sure that we were

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
doing things like using proper color

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,559
contrast making sure that our typography

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,360
was large enough to read

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,799
and ensuring that focus states and hover

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
states were used correctly throughout

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,400
the design

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,799
the second challenge was the nice to

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
have versus the must-have

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,960
um some ideas that we had wouldn't have

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,080
been able to be implemented in time for

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,000
mvp

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,159
um and so that came to a large

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,679
discussion of if it should be dropped or

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
maybe we should think about doing a

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,279
phase two

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,120
uh the third challenge was understanding

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,840
our audience and what their intention

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
was

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
there was a lot that they could do with

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,600
this theme and we wanted to give them as

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,600
many options as possible

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,039
out of the box still being able to hit

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,039
our timeline

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,000
and then finally typography was a

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,240
challenge um so we had to find a font

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,240
that i utilized the sil open font

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,399
license so it was compatible with the

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,760
drupal.org distribution packaging

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,840
requirements

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,440
it also had to provide a wide variety of

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,480
font weights and fit with

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,559
the theme uh and design that it was

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
updated and felt modern

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,120
so what we ended up with was metropolis

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,240
for our sans serif font

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,480
um and surreal or not surreal um

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,000
sorry that's the designer of laura and

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,480
laura which is a google font

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,760
the designer is surreal um which i think

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,320
i'm pronouncing that right

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,559
um is for our uh serif font

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,559
so now i'm going to take you into a

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,960
guided tour of the designs

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,440
so i'm going to share my screen again

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,520
and i'm going to open up figma here

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
so this is a real treat because usually

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,880
i use

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,039
uh animation i use animation so i

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
usually do short video clips um but

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,320
because

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
this is being done over happen and there

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
may be some lag

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,799
we decided to actually open up the figma

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
files and take you through them so

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,480
so you might have to double click my

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
screen again in order to see the guided

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
tour

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
um so one thing that i also wanted to

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,880
mention is i may be looking a little bit

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,960
back and forth just because i'm

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,559
looking at the designs while i'm also

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,480
trying to look at the screen and seeing

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,840
all the wonderful uh comments that are

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,000
coming in so um

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,840
there may be some back and forth with my

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,480
head and i apologize for that ahead of

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,000
time

00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,559
so um so when we

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
started applying to the design to pages

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,600
um we started with the out of the box

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,000
landing page

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
and with an article page uh the

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,520
reasoning for this is because we wanted

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
to design for our worst case scenarios

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,240
first

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,240
uh so with the out of the box landing

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,919
page that would probably have the least

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,640
amount of content that would appear on a

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,880
page

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,960
then an article page would probably be

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,760
the best-case example of what

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
would have the most content on the page

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
um

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,480
so with the out of the box landing page

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
uh our major goal was basically to

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
rework and organize the content

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,760
so it was more helpful to get a user

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
started

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,679
um so we made some copy suggestions um

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,480
and also introduced some new copy to

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,720
kind of help

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,039
guide users along and provide helpful

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,039
links

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,080
so with the article page what we did

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,640
is we created a hypothetical blog

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,360
article

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,360
that touted the new theme and this

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,480
allowed us to work out more complex

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,880
patterns of the design system including

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,679
refining the type system so figuring out

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,240
what our h1 through h5s would look like

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,080
what our body copy would look like what

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,440
quotation copy would look like

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,080
and caption copy this also

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,559
allowed us to work out other patterns

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,360
like

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,080
tables lists and what comments would

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
look like

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,200
and then how these patterns would work

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,399
together

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,399
on a page itself

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,360
so once we had that complete uh we then

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,480
focused on

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
figuring out uh the navigation and the

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,279
header and all the different states that

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,799
it could appear in

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,960
um so we wanted to we wanted to provide

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,799
a second level drop down that users can

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,440
activate out of the box

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,720
and this would allow users to give them

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,840
a little bit more control when

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,799
organizing their eye

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,559
structure when it came to navigation and

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,640
that drop down had to feel modern

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
it had to fit with the design um so we

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,240
kept it pretty simple

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,440
used a slight drop shadow which i don't

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,880
know is coming through

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,640
sometimes drop shadows don't come

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
through screen shares but

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,120
um we use the slight drop shadow and

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,240
then bring in some of the core colors of

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
the aloe vera theme

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,559
so search was large we wanted search to

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,360
feel large and up front and

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,960
focused um and this would help it feel a

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,440
little bit more modern

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,640
but it also needed to feel like a search

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
bar itself

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
um and there was actually a lot of back

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,960
and forth that we have with the search

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,279
bar that i'll review a little bit later

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
but we ended up going with a darker

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
version of the search

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
bar because um it felt modern but it

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,880
also

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,880
felt like a search bar

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,720
so one thing with the navigation is that

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,159
the navigation

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,880
had to be flexible so with the design

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,960
here

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
um this is this is like the best case

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,519
scenario so we have

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,480
five items in the design here for the

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
navigation

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,679
and all those navigational items are

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,760
pretty short

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,600
um this probably most likely wouldn't

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,880
happen um

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,360
so what uh we had to figure out was

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,600
what would happen if the user were to

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,919
have 10 navigational items and they all

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,399
had pretty long line lengths

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
so what we did is we wrapped up the

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,880
navigation

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,960
in a hamburger nav after it hits

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,159
a max width and this actually allowed us

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,440
to bring these patterns down to tablet

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,640
and mobile so as you can see here

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,519
navigation on mobile um one thing with

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,440
the header on mobile is that we had to

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880
uh we wanted to include more room for

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,919
branding um

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
so we wrapped up the uh

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,399
some of the secondary items like the

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,120
sign up the login and the search into

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:59,360
the expanded version of the navigation

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,480
so one thing to note too is we have a

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,600
neat interaction

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,760
that i can't really show here um but

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,880
if afterwards i'll share a link with you

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,240
guys where you

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,559
be able to uh go to a demo and actually

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,200
see

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,600
how this works but uh with the aloe vera

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
theme

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,720
on scroll down the navigation itself

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,679
wraps up into a hamburger now

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,679
that the user can actually access at any

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,320
time so if they click that hamburger nav

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:31,840
the navigation would expand on desktop

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,640
we also had to include uh uh

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,480
think about how users would use the area

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,120
for branding and site naming

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
um so what we did is we designed several

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,760
different variations for backgrounds

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,440
that branding could appear on so we have

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,919
lighter backgrounds for

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
darker branding and then we also have

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,200
darker backgrounds that the user can

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,080
choose if they are using

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,080
uh if their branding or logo is lighter

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,440
and really quickly with the blog listing

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,640
page i just wanted to note that

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,880
our main focus was this for this was to

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,040
increase scannability so what we did is

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,879
we made titles really large

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,599
um and then uh we have descriptions and

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,560
dates we set to secondary and we felt

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,960
like this would help

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,879
uh increase the scannability when users

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,879
are looking for specific keywords

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,040
pagination um we actually took a lot of

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,359
clues from claro from this

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,359
and if you don't know uh what claro is

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,919
claro is the admin

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,960
uh redesign initiative that has been

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,159
ongoing

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,760
um and so they had already gone through

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,800
this big design process

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,639
and gotten feedback for accessibility um

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,399
and so we had actually taken a lot of

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,320
cues from claro and brought them into

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,320
oliveiro because their stuff had already

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,520
gone through accessibility review

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,839
um and uh we felt like we wanted some

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,839
uh similarity between the two themes so

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,560
with the uh editor tabs uh we didn't do

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,560
much

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,680
of an update with these all we did was

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,240
update the color

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,760
and the fonts so they fit with the theme

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,520
there was some back and forth with the

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,680
editor tabs that i will

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,200
um review in a little bit and show you

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,160
some of the

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,160
evolution of those

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
and forms so there's a lot of back and

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,839
forth with forms

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,520
um we had to make forms feel uh modern

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,200
and up-to-date and fit with the aloe

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,160
vera theme um

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,280
but they also had to be accessible um so

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,680
what we did is we took

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,079
a lot of cues from claro especially when

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,280
it came to things like focus dates and

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,760
hover states

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,119
error messages um there's still some

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,280
back and forth going on

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
with um the forms because we want to

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,000
make sure that they are fully accessible

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
so some of the designs actually that i'm

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,440
reviewing right now

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
may already be updated in the theme so

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,440
mike and putra have been

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
diligently going and updating some of

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
the accessibility feedback that's been

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
coming through to make sure that it

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,000
passes

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,000
on accessibility

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,079
and finally the design has to work with

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,160
right to left languages so we just did a

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,520
really quick mock-up to make sure

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,839
that uh that it read correctly and that

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,960
everything still worked okay within the

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,560
aloe vera theme

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,560
that we had designed so

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,119
so now i just really quickly want to

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,200
review ideas uh that didn't make it so

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,040
this is kind of like the bloopers reel

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,520
um of the uh

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
the presentation um so i'm gonna review

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,400
the admin bar real quick

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,920
so we have we met we landed on a

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,599
light version of the or the editor tabs

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,760
um i caught the admin bar but it's

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,839
actually the uh editor tabs

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,520
um but we had started with a darker

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,760
version um and we had

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,520
actually gotten feedback that this felt

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,240
too focused and it didn't really fit

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
with our

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,520
uh light and bright adjective that we

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,880
had uh

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,200
originally established um so there was

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
uh some other ideas that came through

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,200
with uh

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,280
the editor tabs um so

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,760
we had a couple ideas of trying to make

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
the editor tabs like have less hierarchy

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
on the page

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
um so there were some ideas that we

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,760
designed

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,599
where they actually were in the left or

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,320
right hand side of the page

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,920
and would be pinned there um and we all

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
felt this was a really great idea

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,839
but couldn't be implemented for mvp so

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,839
the idea was kind of scratched

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,079
sidebars um so by default uh it includes

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
aloe vera includes a right sidebar out

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,760
of the box

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,960
but we also designed thinking ahead and

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,440
into the future

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,200
what if eventually we give users the

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,880
option to float the sidebar

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,800
to the left or to the right how does

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
that sidebar interact with the content

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
on the page

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,920
um so that's something that we had uh

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
designed for that isn't quite

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
implemented yet

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,240
and then finally search so there's a lot

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,640
of back and forth on search

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
this is the design that we had landed

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,119
with

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,040
um but we had actually started with a

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,160
lighter uh version of the search bar and

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,960
we got a lot of feedback

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,400
that uh the search was actually uh

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,800
didn't feel like a search bar it felt

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,240
more like a design element of the page

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,160
so we did a couple of um variations of

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,640
the search bar still trying to keep it

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,400
light and bright um but we felt like

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
these two variations really didn't work

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,359
because

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,560
they um deviated too much from the

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,240
actual

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,560
uh adjectives that we had established

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,800
so we ended up with the a darker search

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,800
bar

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
and then finally i just want to review

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,119
some of the design documentation

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,400
and i'm going to go really quickly just

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
to make sure that we have a couple

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,680
minutes for

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,800
uh questions on this um so

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,599
we created design documentation um with

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,640
the goal

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,400
of creating a single source of truth

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,640
so as you're designing really quickly

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,640
from page to page or artboard artboard

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
some small things may be off like the

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
padding and spacing or

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,320
typography wasn't updated after decision

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,200
was made

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,240
so uh with our design documentation it's

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,240
a place for

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,599
other designers and developers to go to

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,359
when they run across

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,960
these discrepancies to kind of answer

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,560
those questions

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,119
um so five things that we focused on

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,320
for aloe vera documenting was uh

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,599
typography

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,240
uh the grid system styles scale and

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,119
spacing

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,560
and components and other variations and

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,200
one thing to note too is we have

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,240
documentation in two different places

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,960
we have documentation in the actual

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,480
aloe vera theme file where we create a

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,560
component library

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,599
um and then we also have documentation

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,079
in a google doc

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,720
which spells out more details around

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,280
things

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,680
like uh scale and spacing and how we set

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,280
up our grid system

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
so just really quickly going through

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,680
some of the things that we have

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,839
documented

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,560
in the uh figma file um so we have

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,359
uh the typography documented so all of

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,640
our headings

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,800
um and body copy all our different types

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,160
of typography can be pulled straight

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,520
from a style

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,680
um drop down in figma um

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,920
same with our colors so all these are

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,400
added to our library so it's really easy

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,400
to

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,440
add colors or update colors this has

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,000
been super helpful

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
as we revise our colors for

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
accessibility purposes

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,359
uh just going in and updating the blue

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,000
dark for example making it a little bit

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,079
darker

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,839
and then it updates it across all the

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,760
pages that use that specific color

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,760
and then we have all of our components

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,319
documented so these are all

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,280
uh figma component library items so it's

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,800
super easy

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,280
to pull from these items and put them

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,040
onto an art board and it's easy for us

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,960
as designers to update them as we get

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,319
feedback because it updates them on all

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,280
the artboards that

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,480
have uh that are utilizing these

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,839
components

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,079
so we want to make sure that we are

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,760
capturing everything so we have you know

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,520
all the different types of branding that

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,400
can appear we have

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,440
all of our forms um as components so we

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,640
can update those

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,520
as they come in and we also have our

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,880
grid system

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,720
as a as a library item so it's super

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
easy to update the grid system if we

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,640
update it

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,640
um and also

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,280
also it's easy to apply to new artboards

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,079
as you are

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,640
adding new pages and just one thing to

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,280
note too

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,040
is that i pulled this this diagram from

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,760
our google documentation

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,040
but this just kind of shows how the grid

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,720
system changes from mobile to desktop

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,640
and why something like this needs a

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,319
little bit more detail in a google doc

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,440
for developers to fully understand how

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,920
they should be laying out the grid

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
system

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,680
when they're starting the development

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,680
process

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,760
so um love to talk a little bit more

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,160
about aloe vera but we're coming up on

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
on time here um so it looks like we have

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,599
a little bit

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
of uh time for questions i do know that

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,480
we do

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,640
have this room for longer than 11 so if

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,200
people want to stick around

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,560
yeah there's not a hard stop unless

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
there's a session you're needing to get

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,680
to

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,839
um but there are two questions already i

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,839
see

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,240
space okay

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,960
sorry i didn't mean to interrupt there's

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,960
a there's a lag in here

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,960
oh no um i have a couple links here

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,880
if you want to learn a little bit more

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,480
about aloe vera highly recommend going

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,160
to the drupal.org

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,920
flash project aloe vera link um

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,520
you'll be able to access things like the

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,760
figma files um

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,280
and the documentation that we created in

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
google and learn a little bit more about

00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,520
the process that we didn't get to in

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,119
this talk

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,200
um and then we also have a slack channel

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,920
so if you want to join the initiative

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,599
and help out

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,839
highly recommend that you join the slack

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,800
charter in drupal.slack.com and just

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,319
look for the

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,040
aloe vera um the aloe vera

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,000
uh channel and then we also have our

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,000
evaluation

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,440
so please fill this out this is a link

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,520
another reminder it's

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,560
pinned at the top of the chat actually

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,560
thanks to bethany

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,000
so two two quick questions i've already

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,440
seen i'll take the first one and i'll

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,680
pass the second one along

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,960
to jen the first one was related to was

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,839
from dan

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,400
uh about uh and i won't try to say your

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,000
last name

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,680
having the last name pawnshot i'm quite

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
accustomed to people mispronouncing my

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,680
last

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,280
name but uh it's he asked was load time

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
performance considered when selecting

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,160
fonts and the number of fonts and font

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,319
weights

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,359
and the answer to that is essentially

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,119
yes in that

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,280
early on actually we were doing a lot of

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,280
work to try to limit the number of

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,760
weights especially acros since there

00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,599
were

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,200
we wanted to have both a sans serif and

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,560
a serif face within the

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,319
design system um and uh

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,960
as we went along there was a constant

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,680
back and forth and mike herschel who has

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,359
been commenting here and there uh and

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,520
putra and others were helping us

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,400
evaluate like it you know

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,960
where do we at what point will the fonts

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
that were

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,319
there were working with what number of

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,680
weights and whatnot do we maybe start

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,599
seeing a performance hit

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,520
thankfully we actually didn't really run

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,640
into at least not that i recall jen can

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,960
correct me

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,400
we never ended up having push back

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,119
saying this is way too many weights

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,119
because we

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,040
we essentially kept the number of

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,240
weights for each face

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,359
fairly low so um

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,240
yeah the next question i i saw uh jen if

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,359
you want to

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,000
talk about this was related to how much

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,599
we were able to or not able to do any

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,359
usability testing

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,000
within the process yeah so unfortunately

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,599
because

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,839
of the mvp deadline that we had

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,319
um we didn't we weren't able to do much

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,920
usability testing uh

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,920
we we would have actually really liked

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,800
to do more than use more usability

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,119
testing

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,079
um but that is one of the things that we

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,800
actually considered

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
as the theme gets releases released is

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,319
uh

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,720
making sure that we have a way to

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,760
take feedback and then that way we can

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,560
improve the theme

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,440
as we start rolling out new features or

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,680
um

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,520
just going uh going through and like bug

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,680
fixing too so

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,720
yeah the design currently is not

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,760
actually done

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,359
quote unquote and we still even even

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,400
right now there is a paper doc with

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,800
several tasks

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,440
uh mike and putra and the team working

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,119
on it

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,520
continue to share things that are being

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,680
found so usability testing is sort of

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,680
still in progress essentially

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,640
um i'm wondering if i missed any others

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,280
we are

00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,640
at the hour right now so if any of you

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,640
had a different session that you are

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,480
you were hoping to get to i just want to

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,720
give you a fair warning

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,160
please know that it's at the hour um and

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,640
for those of you

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,319
uh who came there's been a lot of people

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,960
through here we really appreciate

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,760
uh i'm happy to stay on if there are

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,560
more questions

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,319
i'm not sure if i saw any uh question

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,119
can you explain the spectrum analysis

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,720
exercise a little more

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,720
from david luke um

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,599
and let's see there's another one what's

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,680
next for the aloe vera theme

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,839
uh those look like the two that we've

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,560
missed so far the spectrum analysis

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,800
exercise

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,480
one thing i'll note on that is that the

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,040
most important thing over the years that

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
i've found

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,480
doing that is to ensure that

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,680
both adjectives that you select even if

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,400
they're in opposition

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,720
neither are broadly a perceived negative

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,760
because

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,480
it loses its value entirely so uh so

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,520
things like

00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,240
um formal versus casual like

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,960
can very brand a brand which of those

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,040
they want

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,640
it's none of them are inherently

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,760
negative words

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,400
but if you put things in opposition like

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,680
that sound negative in and of themselves

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,720
like fresh versus

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,560
stale or something like that you'll tend

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,800
to only find that people want the thing

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,720
that's not negative so um

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,400
the actual hardest part of it is is

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,760
trying to select

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,800
the examples that we used um uh

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,640
i've sort of we we developed some we we

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,680
peppered in some of them we've developed

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,760
them over the years

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,599
uh margo bloomstein wrote a book on

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,000
content strategy that had

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,960
a wholly different exercise but had had

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,440
a whole

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
list of adjectives in it that um i

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,480
remember working off of at one point

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,200
when i first started trying to create

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,000
these

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:53,839
exercises that book i believe was called

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,240
content strategy at work is that right

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,960
i'll look that up and post it after but

00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,960
um

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,119
jen did you have any other details you

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,160
wanted to share on spectrum analysis

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,160
exercise um no it's just that

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,000
i think the hardest part is from the

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,119
spectrum analysis is coming up with the

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,400
adjectives that you

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,079
you want to use um and we actually

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,680
have been experimenting with adding

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,839
visuals to those adjectives

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,359
because we've had some clients come back

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,000
and be like well can you explain what

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,559
light and bright

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,079
means um so we'll actually have a visual

00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,160
of a website that

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,440
uh illustrates what light and bright uh

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,440
what we're thinking about when it comes

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,559
to light and bite bright versus dark and

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,400
impactful

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,760
um so yeah

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,400
um and uh the other thing

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,119
that i will say about spectrum analysis

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,119
is

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,480
a lot of the value is in the discussion

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,160
it's an exercise that we've

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,000
done historically in actual live

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,520
in-person workshops and in this case

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,839
we developed a way to do it together

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,800
online but

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,000
where exactly the gravity of people's

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,240
answers fall

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,160
is is informative but when you get the

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,400
group of stakeholders

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,440
talking out loud about why they think it

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,280
should fall where

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,200
a lot of times the real insights about

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,599
what people stylistically want to see

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,920
happen

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,520
come out so another question was was

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,000
layout builder in mind at all when

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,359
building

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,640
the theme for content entry experience

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:23,359
um and i feel like i don't know if

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,440
mike herschel can even jump in as a but

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:30,480
that almost feels like more of a mic

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,880
question um let's see am i out

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,559
this is neato mosquito here i know hi

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,680
mike

00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,880
hey can you hear me we're drafting

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,599
people now

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,559
all right you two like completely rock

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,040
this is like

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,800
great so thanks for like you're like the

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,240
thought process that goes involved like

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,160
people just don't realize like the

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,359
thought process and this is so deep and

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,920
thoughtful and uh like i have

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,599
i have implemented uh websites that i do

00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,359
not like to design for and it's

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,960
my thing i hate the most and this is

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,680
just like so easy to work with because i

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,119
just love it

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,960
thank you so to get to the question

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,000
layout builder like

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,440
i don't think you two like uh kind of

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,359
put support for this in the design

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,160
process but we sure did seem for it you

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,160
know so like

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,359
core ships with a number of uh different

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,079
like what do you call it layouts you

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,240
know like

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,520
you know three wide four wide and

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,040
different options in there

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,960
we override the templates for all those

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,480
just to make sure there's proper spacing

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,400
because within like our grid system

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,440
there's like what is it like 18 pixels

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,640
or something like that

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,599
a gap in between those and so we made

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,800
sure that those

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,520
like between the different regions

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,040
they're 18 pixels and that we have like

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,400
we're implementing vertical rhythm which

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,480
which y'all didn't talk about but

00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,319
there's vertical rhythm units uh

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,760
between each of the sections going in so

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,599
it should look and

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,800
work wonderful there's one issue that

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,440
i've seen in the issue queue that i need

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,440
to tackle

00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,040
yeah and we actually i do have a

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,599
recollection of a conversation when we

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,119
were

00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,599
trying to um work out

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,559
variations for block designs and with

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,559
headings without

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,000
and how does this block appear and then

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,000
we started working out

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,520
okay but with layout builder and the

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,200
flexibility that's going to be there to

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,640
put these types of things in here

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,319
are we going to have contextual

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,000
awareness and so there was some

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,640
discussion in the design process

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,240
where where needed but most of the lift

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,359
on the layout builder stuff was not on

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,559
the designers

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,559
um yeah uh the

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,559
i see a question from brett williamson

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,520
what's next for the aloe vera theme any

00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,400
enhancements or new features coming

00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,880
yeah so like the main i'm gonna throw a

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,559
link

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,920
in there and this is a site that just

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,760
literally launched by

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,040
by this woman karen who's in like

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,280
somewhere in canada and

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,040
it's like basically the oliveira theme

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,200
uh but but they ended up sub theming it

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,079
which we don't officially support

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,599
um and to change the colors but like the

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,680
biggest thing that people want is just

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,319
to be able to change those colors

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,800
you know but um that's more difficult

00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,400
than a

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,559
than it sounds because of our because of

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,480
course commitments for ie11 like if we

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,680
could just change you know like the css

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,960
custom properties

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,119
and do it it would be great um but that

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,800
is on the horizon because like that's

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,640
something i personally want and and if

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,960
it can't go in core we might make like

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,839
like a sub theme contributed theme or

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,920
something like that you know

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,440
but long story short i really want to

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,800
get that done i want like a dark mode

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,319
and i want things like that but

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,000
right now we're just concentrating on

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,000
getting this into core like just core

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,200
coding requirements with like javascript

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,160
selectors there's

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,559
we're we're focusing on making our focus

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,000
states

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,000
consistent across like everything um

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,440
there's a lot of accessibility issues we

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,960
haven't crossed the accessibility gate

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,559
yet and then we have to get into core

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,520
and like so getting into core is just

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,280
huge

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,200
and and it's going to be a big lift from

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
here so we're going to get in the core

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,800
hopefully as stable but

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,000
like more likely experimental but we're

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,319
not going to be default

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,800
until at the earliest drupal 92 but yeah

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,319
on the color front we did on the design

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,319
side at least we're thinking

00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,640
of color typologically as we were

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,680
designing and built it out in figma

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,280
in a way that would basically little

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,520
make it a little simpler for us down the

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,079
road when we're able to take on that new

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,720
feature

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,559
which is exciting i'd love to do it to

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,800
have color variations

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,319
available and then to have some kind of

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,800
a system in place for

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,599
color override that would scale across

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,000
the

00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,680
um sort of hsl variations of colors

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,280
would be really neat but

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,960
yeah my plan for implementing that is

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,760
just to kind of cheat off a claro

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,880
whatever they do

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,930
i'm just going to like look over their

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,580
shoulder and be like all right

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:37,580
[Laughter]

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,960
great have i missed any other questions

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,520
i think

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,680
i've caught the ones with cues in front

00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,839
if i've missed your question

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:55,440
