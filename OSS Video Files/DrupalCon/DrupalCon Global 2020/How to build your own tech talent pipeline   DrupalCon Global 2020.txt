00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
way to get know each other not like when

we're offline we can't really talk in

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
the same time

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
so if you can go to the chat system

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,199
typing in

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
which company you come from what's your

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
role are

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,760
and we can you know have a conversation

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
later

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
i also going to leave a qa session end

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
of the

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
session and we can uh leave some time

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
for that

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,119
when you do questions can you uh prefix

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
your question with a

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,320
q letter

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
so let's start so first of all i'm going

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
to talk about why

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,280
i'm talking about um how to build your

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,479
tech pipeline

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,439
and why i'm talking about it and

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,880
when you demand out space the supply

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,000
there's a lot of

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,159
companies that need drupal developers

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
but not all the people go to school they

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,320
know they learn

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,399
drupal uh a lot of like a talent

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,520
uh developers they may not use drupal

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
before

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
so that's the one the reason we need to

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,600
build our own talent

00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,159
and also the company grows as your own

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
when your company growing and you need

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,640
more talent developers

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,640
um pms and designers all different roles

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
and also give back to the community

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,760
you're helping foster the girls

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,599
of the drupal talent so then the the

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
drupal community more have more

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,319
drupal com like developers so they

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
contribute back to the drupal community

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,400
even though when you train those diapers

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,560
they no longer with your company someday

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,760
but they still going to benefit the

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,879
whole drupal community

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,599
using as an example dj kina

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,959
is a small company one few years ago

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,000
when we're growing

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,879
from 15 to 80 plus which in

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,360
four to five years and really quick

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,599
growing

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
you can see us if you've been drupal

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
calm offline before you see a lot of

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
people like me

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,000
very jersey and that's how you recognize

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,519
us

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,519
because we're from canada and the

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
each year you can see our drupalcom

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,120
members is growing

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,120
we grow so much in the past few years

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,280
and 62 percent of the developers

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
is actually from our internship and

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,599
co-op programs

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
so today i'm going to talk to you about

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,480
how we build

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,599
our tech tagline the pipeline from the

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
driven developers

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,640
and how we foster that growth

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
environment

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
affected the requirement to the junior

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
developers sometimes

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
is even big gain before you do the job

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
posting

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,840
even before there's a job even opened up

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
so you need to prepare even your company

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,360
now growing right now

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
and you got prepared for the next few

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
years

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
for example if you're coming and going

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,560
in next two years you get

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,280
plenty seats right now so how to do that

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
i'm going to start to talk about in the

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
three

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,760
points first you need to prepare your

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
cultural value

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,760
and make sure your agency is attractive

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
to the place for the people to come to

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,239
work with

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
and the second i'm going to talk about

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
how to plan the seat a roadmap

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,480
so you can practice yourself as well

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,840
and in end and we want to talk about

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
coaching for the girls

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,239
okay so the first part get the culture

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,479
right in other attracting

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,000
really talented developers you need had

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,000
radical transparency in

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,160
uh culture so when the developer come in

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
or the you know your designers or

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
project managers

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,479
they feel like attract by your country

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
by your culture

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,720
you have a meaningful works because a

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
lot of times interns and co-ops

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
when they attracted to them and they

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,360
actually get into the real practice

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,400
it is okay to make mistakes and learn

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
from them

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
that way this culture builds up the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,840
learning system

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,560
so it's hard to always criticizing the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,759
junior developers if you want to attract

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
and then coach them

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
and make sure their girl and also

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
open-minded

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
question there's no question is a bad

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
question always encouraging each other

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,520
to ask questions and always learning and

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,520
innovating

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
so that is another good point to

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,880
attracting on your

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,919
talent and also empower to lead

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,240
make sure your employees can

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,000
present your companies when they go out

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
there they are attracting

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,120
more talent to come to to your company

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,320
because they want to working with those

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,479
talent themselves

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,960
it's like a big garden that's why you

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,800
see my plantation have a lot of flowers

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,240
with other trees and a lot of seeds and

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
trees

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
think about your core values and make

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,479
sure you build that culture

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
and it's like you you have sunny days

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
raining days

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
your culture may deal with a lot of

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,199
different challenges

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,919
and with that great quarter value you

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
build

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,240
it's going to attract more people so now

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
your soil is ready

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,800
so how we're going to go next is

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
plant the seed to make sure the girl and

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,520
so the foster girls

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,479
environment there's three ways today i'm

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,400
going to talk about planning the seat

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,919
first get to thailand to know your

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
company and second

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,039
is get to know the talent and the third

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
is we're going to focus on today is

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,600
talking about teaching drupal class in

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
the colleges

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
so how to get the talent to know your

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,280
company a lot of time if you're a

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,319
smaller agency

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
it's hard to you know compete with a

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
bigger

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,319
you know well-known brand agency out

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
there

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,400
and how do you get know from the

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
students in the universities and

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
colleges

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
get them to know you so you can invite

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
the college students or the university

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,199
into your company have a tour

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
in kena we usually run like a few tours

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
each

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,479
semester when the school starts we

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
invite the students who specifically

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,280
study the program who are going to

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,840
emplacement

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,759
in our company have a tour during the

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
tour we not only have a managers do a

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,759
presentation we also get the people who

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
graduate from the same university

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
and do a presentation as well and answer

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,199
the student questions

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
so they can connect they can see their

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,479
possibilities

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880
then they finish school they say oh i

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
don't have to only be uh you know a c

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,919
plus but the upper or java developer

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
i can learn php i can become a drupal

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,199
developer

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
i can become a technical coordinator i

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
can become a project manager there's so

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,000
many opportunities for me

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
but until they see their previous like

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
students

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
who graduated from the same school and

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
even same program and had that

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
experience

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
it's going to really help them to launch

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
in the future

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
they may now to get hired by you now but

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
in when they graduate in three to four

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,479
years

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
they are your future employees so also

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,400
hosting events

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,599
in your company for example we host

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,639
lindacs

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,919
ux need apps events those events gonna

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
have your local talent

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,879
they'll get a feeling of your culture

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
also spends uh you know sponsored events

sponsored events like this triple gang

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
sponsor events like hakitang and also

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
take

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
all sorts of technical events in your

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,159
local

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
when you sponsor those events you

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
sometimes you can ask speak for the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,279
events as well

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
in the local college and universities we

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
usually take the chance

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,760
go to talk to the students and

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
presenting

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,880
what in the industry what are we doing

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
right now

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,519
what is the sharing the skills that they

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,360
may want to focus on or

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,800
share the experiences really early on

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,519
and also posting the club jobs and in

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
the college

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,880
and always participating in the co-op

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
internship program

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
that's also going to help attracting

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
talent

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
in the future so now the talent to get

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,680
know you

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,399
so you also need to get to know the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,959
talent when you're attending those

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,880
events

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
for example i'm attending the computer

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,959
science events

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,880
every year i talk to all the students in

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,519
the computer science program

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
who are you know we walk around it's big

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,720
it's not like

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
hr function it's uh it's not like a

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
hiring event it's more like a social

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,279
event

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
for the student have a chance to talk to

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
different companies

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
ask them questions asking what type of

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,320
roles in the company

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
what technology you're using what the

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
culture look like

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
so you can get you ask a lot of students

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,360
the question as well

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,760
you can get note them you can you know

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,839
in the end they add you to the linking

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
you get to know their strengths so when

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,080
you build that pool of talent

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
make sure you do write down the notes i

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,800

part of their business card i play the

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
same to me the students

future when they do what their strengths

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
sometimes you may don't have a position

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,240
for them right now but in the future

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
you have other roles and you remember

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600

position at the moment

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
but i know in the future i can find them

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
and hire them later

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
we did hire people through that message

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
many times

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,959
so when i said we put people on files

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,160

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
invite your technical people like

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
director development or managers

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,519
uh from them and all your tech leads go

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
to those events

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
not just hr functions because in order

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
to get to know

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
the programmers and the developers you

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
need somebody who also

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,880
in the same passion with them and can

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,839
talk in the same languages

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,959
and then get to know them more than you

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
know just the

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,040
administration side of course your hr

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
person also going with you so that way

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
they can answer

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
uh the you know culture and also generic

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,640
like hr

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
questions for the students as well you

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,920
can

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
empower your staffs go to colleges and

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,480
universities

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,480
to be a mentor we have a lot of staff

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
mentor in local colleges

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,079
and using their volunteer times and they

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
build that connection

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,760
they build a lot of a good connection

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,640
and no student come to us

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,760
say we really want to work for djokina

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
because i sell

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,240
your company and spend time and to get

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
no people

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
and then be in the school program at

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,519
leisure board i'm in three different

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,720
schools of agriboard

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
and helping them to foster the next two

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
years

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
the curriculum sometimes take university

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,040
and

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
colleges many years to change their

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
curriculum

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,040
but if you're on the graduate board

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,639
sometimes they can take

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,079
your consideration when you talk about

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,920
different technologies

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
and what students need to learn they

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,240
take that in they do a survey

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
and with helping shape things in the

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,800
future what the course they can be

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
taught

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,959
the fact maybe not affect immediately

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,320
but in long term is a payoff

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,279
also teaching the first very important

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,959
is like try to teach what you know we

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,160
started teaching drupal courses

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,720
at local college three years ago

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
we're visiting this free course in a

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
local college

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,760
called fanshawe college in linden will

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
provide the fundamental of drupal

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
training

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
students the from four different

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
programs

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,279
the training now could only create a

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,160
pipeline for us

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
also create a big pipeline for interior

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
canada

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,279
or in the worldwide we're really proud

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
palmer map vista local college did this

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,120
three years program for now

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,680
and we started in 2017. we connect the

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
program

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,120
coordinator which used to be really uh

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
a razor board on the person and always

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,160
you know

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,880
mentor and he was really impressed by

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
how he kind of goes so we connect we

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,680
build this program

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,600
and we um we find

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,320
our staffs from to volunteer to their

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,760
times

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,519
to do this program we to see this

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,000
program went so successfully

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,360
even other local agencies follow our

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
footsteps

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
and they start teaching in last year the

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
year before

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
so what college going to provide when we

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
partner with college

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,600
they provide a recommended student list

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,199
they have a course already filter the

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,839
list one student

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,079
could take this course and they also

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,639
communicate students about the course

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,720
and they also provide classrooms and the

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
facilities like computer labs

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,839
and they also schedule the works between

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,120
the students and our staffs

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,519
so what to take uh who's taking those uh

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,079
twelve weeks uh drupal courses then

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,199
the is 12 weeks free course is offered

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
to other students

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,880
in four different programs around like

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
20 students

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
you probably ask why only why is only 20

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
students

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
because we want to make sure the

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,760
classroom size is reasonable enough we

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,760
can do workshops

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
and also we can coach in helping those

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,440
20 students

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,959
sometimes it's 24 because we already

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
have our four co-ops

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,440
who already applied equina also joined

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,399
this program as well

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,839
so who are the teachers is a great

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,920
talents from our

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,320
staff they taught by our staff

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
and from introduction to drupal to sub

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
building and to layouts and

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
simi and to module development and also

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,040
to set performance

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,800
the teacher are like fundament jordan

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,079
had a great session yesterday

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,120
we have luke scott tanner martin

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,160
and kailyn and many many tech leads and

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
who also

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
teach this class before some of them are

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,880
drupal grandmasters

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
some are drupal certified developers

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,720
they are our senior staff

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,600
and tech leads talk about

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,519
why the each person teaching like

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,399
there's only one course why we want

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,680
six people to teach one course uh there

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,480
is a really

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,040
message behind this first of all those

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
are

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,399
they have their even though they are

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
grandmaster they know everything

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,079
but each person has their passion areas

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,199
so they focus on the specialty areas to

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,120
teach students

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
also give the student a chance to know

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
six different

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
type of developers and senior developers

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,880
so they can

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,320
get mentored by six different style of

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
the developers

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
and they focus on each area each person

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,000
teaching two classes

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
that way also is good for the teacher as

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,160
well because

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759
remember they also our full-time staff

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
they also have a billable hours they

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
have projects

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
they have because they are senior

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
developers and triple gram masters they

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
already have a lot of project work as

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,000
well

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,160
so that will take them only two classes

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
per term so it's something capable they

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,839
do with their time

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
and also it's benefit to the students to

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
connect them after

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,279
because each developers have different

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
strengths we want to give the student

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,480
expose a different type

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,480
string surface talent

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,600
so why is the drupal class for the

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,360
12 weeks because we can cover more and

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
each week only have one class

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
and then there's some practice they can

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,600
do after

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,199
we intro to the drupal set up the drupal

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
site as the first one

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,360
we also introduce the workflow because

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
in a college and university usually

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
they don't really work at a real

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,520
agency's workflow so you can teach them

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,760
how to the real gate workflow work with

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,199
drupal with the setups

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,120
and then we start to teach instead

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,600
building we're also teaching

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
seeming and the module development and

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,199
in the end

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,600
we'll teach them how to launch and set

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,839
performance accessibility and so on

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,799
and in the last one we already do a once

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,280
a workshop

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,919
to cover any q and a's things they have

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,760
questions

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,640
and before and each class usually is

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
three hour long

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,280
so why i'll only offer this course from

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,120
january to april

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,360
because those are prepared for the

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
graduate students because right now

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,880
you're in january

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
to april that's before the last term

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
before the graduation

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
also they can pair it up with our

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,160
internship program

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,960
so they are not only get learned from

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960
the class

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
they also claim can apply for the

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
internships program

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
also start in january to april and start

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,799
to practice as well

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,280
and right before they graduate

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,120
and learning a lot of hands-on

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,039
applications because we try to get them

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,200
like hand down exercise

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
as a part of the drupal training and the

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
intern coops

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
they also get a view of one project in

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
the end

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,039
i see some questions in the

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
in the chat already i will start to

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
answer those questions

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,440
after the slide if you don't mind and

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,320
also if you

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,400
question for me um please um prefix the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,720
queue so i know

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
we can i can answer the end of this

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
session

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,400
also we have some teachers right here

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,520
can help answer the question as well

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,280
okay back to my session

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
long-term investment this is a really

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,039
long-term investment because

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,360
i calculated how long going to take

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
doing between the january april the

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,760
teacher class

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,840
time is between 182 hours 200 hours

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,120
this is not including how the

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,919
preparation

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,880
time but what they include is like

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,400
annual student

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,360
selection time the 20 student is select

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,039
get interviewed not everybody go to the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,720
program because we want to make sure the

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,679
people who actually want to learn

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,120
to do the program and also there's a lot

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,919
of coordination time

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
and correlation with the teacher and the

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
teacher

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,480
had to take away from their project time

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,160
to working on as a teacher and the sixth

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,960
teacher away from

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,880
the project that means we you know that

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,039
time equal money

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
and the presentation preparation also

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,039
takes time as well

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,880
after the class there is q and a's

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,520
there's exercise reviews

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
and also uh we get together you know

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,240
talk about the

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
student performance and giving feedbacks

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,840
and so on

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,679
just just give you an idea how much time

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,440
you if you want to do this for free

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,520
how much time at least you need invest

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,799
in that term this is not included to

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,240
prepare the

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,799
materials and we also

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
teach in you know with partners okay

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
like in ikea

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,840
they have a good training curriculum

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
already so we build on top of that

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,080
so why are we teaching drupal course in

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,280
a college for free

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,440
because training the future interns

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,640
and co-ops and potential for the

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,880
full-time staffs

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
to get to know the students and through

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
the course attracting the

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,600
student student to know our company

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
culture

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,280
also insuring our drupal practice lead

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,280
our technique to practicing

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,679
and they also learn more by teaching

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,720
the drupal so you you get best through

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,760
teaching

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,840
also starting to see our staffs learn

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,400
becomes giving so much opportunity to

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
teach they start also teaching our

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
clients

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
and they get asking so many different

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,880
plantation events

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,919
because teaching is a great way to

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,720
practice your plantations well

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,039
it's also helped number of like drupal

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,919
trained developers in london ontario

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,840
we have a lot of trained uh developers

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,080
they not necessarily our work equina

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,679
because we can't really hire 20 students

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,840
right after the graduate

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,200
once they get trained they apply for

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,280
other drupal companies

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,320
in canada or even in state

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
another best reason we want to teach in

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
the financial college is

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
the best way to learn is to teach by

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
frank

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,799
which i think jordan in

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,480
here and could be antennas also in the

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
chat as well they couldn't be grey

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
i think they told me many times they

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,200
learn more as when they're teaching and

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,039
coaching others

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,520
so here's the week summary of the role

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,679
map

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,440
when you're seeding so when you plant

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
the seeds like a garden

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
you first you had your soil right your

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,120
company culture right

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,240
and you planted the seeds to get to know

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,880
them and you get

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
they get no use through drupal classes

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,640
and now

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
we talk about internships and co-ops

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
so you can still do that to coach them

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
before they become

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,600
full-time staff so coach for girls

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,840
this is the last point i'm going to talk

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,400
about today

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,280
is make sure your internship programs

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,640
um and the code co-op program is for the

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,000
coaching

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,880
it's not for you know a cheap labor it's

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
they are we're always supporting a paid

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,600
internship but

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,679
the internship is mostly for investment

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,520
you're not only teaching them in the

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,919
classroom and you also now

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,080
they actually get to know your company

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,559
and in the real projects

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
our internship program lasts two months

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
to four months

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,520
the yearly part-time because the college

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,679
students they still have class

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,360
so they come in one day to two days per

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,799
week to

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,039
do the project they usually have four

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,480
internships together we gave them a pro

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,120
bono project

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,840
and its contribution to the nonprofit in

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
local

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,679
so we gave the tech lead and project

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,840
manager to help them

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,679
to get them through the whole process so

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,159
they will learn not only the coding

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,960
they'll learn how to build a site from

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
ground

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,600
from the setup to launch and they learn

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,039
the whole project management process as

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,760
well

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,280
and also we have a co-op program the

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,280
cooper is a bit different

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,000
the reason the co-op is that you live

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,159
from four months long to 16 months long

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
and those are paranoid college and

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,360
universities

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
they need to have the club in order to

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,320
graduate they usually hear

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,919
the full summer of the full year

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,600
for the entire co-op it's almost like a

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
full time but they it's from

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
school and early difference the co-op

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,159
they go back to school

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,000
and doing onboarding those co-ops you

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,120
get to they get trained with the real

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,880
work environment not all the internships

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,679
and co-ops going to become full-time in

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,279
the future

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,919
however those are great seating programs

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,760
make sure they get out trained and and

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,600
get to know you and you can know

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
whose strengths so in the future if they

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,720
do become full-time you know where to

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,640
place them

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
so always make sure that learning

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
environment empowers the students and

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
the co-ops to shine

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,159
because you never know what other skills

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,320
that they had

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,120
before you you just if you just look at

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,120
their resume

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,720
we have online onboarding learning

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
system

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,159
it's great system is on our internet

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,880
it's help

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,760
self-learning and evaluating onboarding

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,840
program

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,360
and we checking make sure they're peer

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,799
mentored checking in the progress and

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
consistent training

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,120
and we track you know their quarters and

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
also have practice integrated with the

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,000
learning

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,000
this internet helped us great

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,039
during the pandemic time we had on

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,279
boarding

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,240
three co-ops through the online system

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,960
so we also keep that consistency we

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,360
already

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,559
know how to onboarding people online

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,200
this really helped us

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
during the pandemic time so we have ran

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
out

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,640
the few new cops and they already gave

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,440
me great feedback about how the system

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
is so

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
consistent and useful they also gave us

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,240
the feedbacks

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
and against our own internet product so

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
they also

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,520
using it and they can also help to

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,520
improve it

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
so we have everything in place to the

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,520
onboarding

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
but very important part not just about

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,640
learning

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
it's about also building relationships

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,799
benjamin said tell me alpha gout teach

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,440
me i'll remember

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,360
and involve me i'll learn that's why we

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,159
really want to

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,440
really stress about you know internships

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,559
and co-ops

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,960
because we pair them up with mentors

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,159
each co-op have one peer mentor with

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,640
them

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,240
they are part of a leadership training

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,799
in order to become a tech lead

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,799
in in kinder you first need to know how

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,919
to mentor others

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,240
training others and also train yourself

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
because it will help your current

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
employee

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,880
to learn how to delegate and how to

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,679
manage in times

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,640
and how to take you know active role in

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,279
onboarding

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
because as a mentor it can be very

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,039
difficult

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,720
with juggling your own work and also

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,159
helping somebody else with their

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,440
complete their work

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,520
so have your employees to become a

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,000
mentor of the co-op internship that's a

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
great

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
product as well

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,120
so we're going to in next few slides i'm

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,640
going to talk about

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,640
how to be a great mentor

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,080
the first one is set expectation clear

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,840
and on the both side not just the

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,520
certification for the mentee

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,520
also the mentees that you play clear

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,440
expression to the mentor as well

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,600
for example send clear expectations

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,679
about when you want to mention

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,520
to try to solve the problem first before

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,679
coming to your solution

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,799
can you teach them how to search the

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,799
right google terms to find the solution

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
and then let them to show you when you

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,240
want to be approached

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,159
and give feedback regular to your

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,000
mentees and

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,919
that how they're doing because some of

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,240
the co-ops and students

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,080
they are maybe a little shy if you don't

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,360
go to practice reach them out they may

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,679
not ask you any question

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,480
because sometimes they still learning

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,399
they may now know what they should ask

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,000
and also celebrate their achievement

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,399
even just the little ones

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
even just they solve some problems and

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,080
where small you feel like

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,320
it's pretty easy for you but celebrate

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,360
with them to encouraging them

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,559
to sell more problems on their own

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,279
and give your mentees you know that

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,000
benefit

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
working with you sometimes what is easy

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
for you

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,799
it doesn't mean it's easy for your

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,559
mentees you do this

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,159
for example you're building drugs so

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,399
many years you know

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,279
those terms to you you know exactly

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,520
which model to use how to do this hulk

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,880
but for your mentee they even don't have

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,159
computer science degree

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,399
or uh from you know a college diploma

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
but they not necessarily understand

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,720
those terms yet

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
so make sure you let them to shadow you

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
to meetings

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,679
or when you're working on tickets let

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,039
them take a look how your problem

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,960
solving

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,240
and also don't be strict in teaching

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,039
technology only

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
and also teaching themselves skills this

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,360
is

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,760
sometimes a lot of time if you have a

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,520
great mentor they also teach you more

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
than soft skills than just the hard

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,919
skills

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,640
accept the safety for your mentees

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,919
provide positive enforcement

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
and stay open-minded and put the office

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,000
of policy aside

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,840
and go extra miles to help them they're

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,799
really going to be grateful even though

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,159
in the future they

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,080
don't work with your company is your

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,360
full-time but they will stay in touch

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,000
that relationship

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,960
over the years and mentor so many people

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,799
even

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,880
these days they may not work in viking

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,559
anymore but i still in touch with them

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,279
because i see the growing in the drupal

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,000
community

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,200
i see them in growing in other areas

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
they maybe even become

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,799
like a company owner by now and they

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,200
become our clients

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,240
they become our contractors build that

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
relationship

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,720
build that solution now plan your seat

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
and be a mentor is rewarding for

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
yourself as well

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,720
because when you see the people grows

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,600
and you see them become excellent

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,080
you feel happy inside you know why your

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,760
job

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,320
make a value also

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,440
in the summary being a great mentor is

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,279
pushing hard

00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,159
than the mentee expect it

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,279
and get the mentees to ask the right

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,000
questions

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,880
and spend you know is you know make sure

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,840
they are being

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,120
you know curious and continuous

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,640
improvement even they become full-time

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,360
they still need to be coached

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
and dare them to dream big i make sure

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,960
they

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,679
are we all are lifelong students we are

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,559
teaching

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,000
we coaching we also learning ourselves i

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,799
learned so much things from

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,960
the people i coach every day and

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,159
appreciate self-taught mentees

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,279
encourage them and coach them

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,640
and teach what do you think

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,760
how to think not to what you think

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,880
exactly this kind of tricky word just

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,960
how do you think

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,159
how do you search in google how do you

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,399
solve the problem not

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,679
exactly the end result because sometimes

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,159
when you think how you think

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,720
it's going to help in a long way as a

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,600
mentee

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,799
it sometimes can be imitating to have a

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,279
bunch of questions

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,799
when you look busy so it's important

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,279
tell your mentees

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,159
how to communicate with you in kenya we

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,200
use slack

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,799
we usually tell the mentees if we have

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,720
my headphone on today

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,720
that means i'm busy please send me slack

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
message said can i have

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
you know questions with you and then set

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,000
up a time but if you tell the mentee

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
that was the time

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
and how frequently and how you want to

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,720
be communicated

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,960
is much better and they'll feel

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,000
comfortable otherwise if they sell you

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,760
always busy

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,559
probably you are and they are free to

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,559
ask your questions

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,799
so end of the this session

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,799
i want to summarizing the three things

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,919
we talked about how to build your own

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,960
pipeline

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,919
prepare your culture style and make sure

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,039
your culture is attracting place to

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,760
people

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,559
and also plan your seats and how do you

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,360
do online

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,840
like do you do uh teaching do you do

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,559
equal

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,440
internships do you go to events and

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,039
think about

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,480
once you have those people how are you

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,080
going to coach them

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,279
i also want to talk a little bit about

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,360
right now the future results the future

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,159
south is become the remote talent is

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,240
available now the local talent also

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,919
working for remote companies

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,799
as a company's managers and leaders

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,679
well our question is now we are no

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,080
longer just

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,720
limiting our local spot now because

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
sometimes

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,760
in the past a lot of people prefer

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,519
working in the office

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,919
after the code then i'll be working from

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,159
home a lot of people get used to that

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,200
working remote and they are okay with

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,360
working remote

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,480
so you're competing not just your local

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,919
company anymore

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,159
you compete the big companies globally

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,720
how we're going to prepare our culture

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,600
to adopting those change

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,399
can we have remote and also people in

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,720
the office

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,760
the hybrid role what type of culture we

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,399
need to change

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,279
to make our agency attractive for people

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,840
from all

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,600
you know different parts of the city and

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,640
also make sure the people who

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,480
in our city you know still growing and

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
growing with us

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,679
and another thing do you plan those

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,640
seats

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
could we do online trainings can we open

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
up

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,159
online colleges and partner with more

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,039
colleges

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,320
not just our local colleges a lot of

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,960
things in my mind

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,960
i think a lot of opportunity out there

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,519
and for the coaching for the girls

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,120
onboarding mentoring online is

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,200
definitely different

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,279
if you want to talk to me afterwards

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,480
we've had some experiencing

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,600
this year particularly about the mentor

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,000
people our co-op some from vancouver and

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,440
some is even local but still from home

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,919
how we're going to deliver the machine

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,559
to them how we coach them how we build

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,120
activities online still make them feel

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,600
that

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,440
that culture you know is experiencing

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,440
that digital experience

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,440
and i think i only have a few minutes

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,600

how do it work for remote companies

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,159
it's about uh

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,839
onboarding or co-ops

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,640
okay as i mentioned we do this um

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,480
for the college it's right now it's all

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,440
like in a college

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,440
it's not it's in person training we

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,839
think about in the future

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,920
how we're going to remote but for co-ops

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,680
there are like a remote

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,520
at least this year and

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,599
if i have a question when it comes to

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,240
the cost how big is the proportion of

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,240
the costs

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,760
all the training programs combined to

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,079
your or outcost

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,240

they do go events your whole events it

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,560
seemed to me that all this is quite

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,280
amazing but also very costly how much

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,480
time the working time is your staff
