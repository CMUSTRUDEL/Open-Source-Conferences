editors can create these pages on the

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,840
fly without

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,840
any dependency on the developers they

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,920
could just use drag and drop features

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,280
and create a reusable components onto

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,520
the pages

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,119
easy content comes with tightly coupled

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,119
and decoupled cms

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,600
and when you when you are using decouple

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
you don't have to worry about

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
any essential features getting miss on

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
so it has all

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
must have cms features like drag and

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,280
drop interface creating menus

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
and previewing and publishing content

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
easy content also gives you an ai

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
powered generated content

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
with this you could you could be ahead

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
there's a special content type called

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,280
smart article which helps you

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,960
uh do image tagging or image captioning

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
text tagging and text summarizations

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,159
yeah so easy content has a lot of

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,159
features into it you should actually

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
give it a try it's it's as i said it's

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
an

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,200
open source on rupert.org you could go

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,800
ahead download it and you know

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,800
spin up a site

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,959
so let me just quickly go through a demo

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,959
and start with uh demoing the ai

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
generated content piece wherein i'll

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,840
show you how

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,160
easy smart article you could

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
generate smart tags image tags and the

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,640
content summary

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
this is an easy content uh sample demo

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
website which has been generated using

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
those two links

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,800
it ships with some default content

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,239
landing page under and one of the

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
article detail pages

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
you could spin up a similar site i will

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,490
quickly go on to the smart article piece

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,589
where i am creating one of the smart

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,589
[Music]

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
articles

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
yeah so while i'm creating a smart

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,239
article i'm uploading an image

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
i'll choose one of the image from my pc

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,200
uh

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
now when i upload this image this image

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
would give me an

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,519
auto caption uh so once this is uploaded

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
it will help me with the caption which

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
is generated using ai and ml services

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
these ai and ml services right now we're

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
using

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
google vision to generate this caption

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,040
uh

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,480
this is a smart article is an entirely

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
plug-and-play you could use any

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
third-party services ranging from google

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
vision

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
amazon or even estrogen ai services you

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
can also generate

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,319
tags using

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
using this again tags are also

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
generating generated using using the

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,599
google vision services here

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,680
you could use any tags which are

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
suggested or you could also add your own

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
tags

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,480
onto here tags are really useful when it

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,239
comes to accessibility and again they

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,519
help in terms of managing your

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,840
uh your assets into the cms now for the

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,080
example when i go on to the library

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,319
system

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
yeah i could easily search my assets

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,760
here with the help of these smart

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
tags which are generated now when i'm

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,720
typing food here

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,159
uh i know that uh you know all my food

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
images food comes in

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,920
would come in and come into the place so

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,280
i no longer have to worry about you know

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,600
managing my assets

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
it comes in really handy when i'm doing

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
the management part of the assets

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
so here in we did two two things we use

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
image tagging

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
and image captioning for the auto

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
services

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,880
now uh i'll go on to the content uh

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
summary and the content tagging part of

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,680
the smart article i'll quickly use

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,680
some of the uh text of

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,520
copy paste one 100 text from here

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
and i'll click on the generate summary

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,800
this is again uh happening using the uh

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,800
third party integration services

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
using google vision and ai and ml

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
services and

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
also use generate tags

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
to generate tags

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,360
so here and how you know i could use

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
summary generation and tags some

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
regeneration and tags are

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
very useful when you consider it from

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,280
the seo perspective

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,680
and while generating meta tags uh

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,639
so this is how you could just spin up

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,520
the articles very quickly uh into into

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
using the easy content cms and with this

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,440
i'll pass on my world to

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,440
ishan to demo the decoupled part

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,080
thanks kamen uh thank you for showing

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,520
the

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,440
ai side of easy content so we got a good

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
look at the

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
ai assistant editorial experience right

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,560
within drupal

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,199
as you type in your content so i'll

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,280
focus on something different now

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
another aspect of easy content is that

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,919
there is a great compatibility with a

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,160
decoupled implementation as well

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,759
so if you were there in yesterday's day

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,039
before yesterday's keynote batteries

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
right this is a screenshot from the

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
keynote and you might have noticed on

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,520
this slide

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
three specifically called out three

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,800
functionalities which

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
uh you typically lose right when you go

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,919
completely decoupled

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,120
you lose the ability to use the layout

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,639
builder uh you

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
lose the ability to preview unpublished

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,639
content uh you're not able to manage

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
you know typical cms features like

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,360
updating menu items and things like that

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
so easy content today allows you to use

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
all these three things that trees called

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
out

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
and i'll give you a quick demo of a

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,479
couple of these functionalities

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
so let's start with the layout builder

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,680
functionality right so

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
there is a content type in easy content

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
called

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,759
landing page its basic

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
content type is put in a couple of

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,240
metadata fields

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
and it will give me a blank page uh you

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
can of course have predefined templates

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
as well but we'll create something from

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
scratch

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,680
now as you can see there are three links

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
here at the top because we've

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,880
plugged this demo site with an angular

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
application within gatsby

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,800
application as well as a next year's

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
react application so as i'm creating a

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
new page on drupal

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
uh you'll see that a corresponding page

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
gets created in my decoupled react

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
application as well

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,280
so the demo page i just created will be

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,360
available here as well on our

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,039
react application which is completely

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
decoupled from drupal

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,120
now i'll start building this page uh

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
like i would do in drupal right

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,039
i'll enable the layout builder it gives

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,880
me the options to add sections

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,759
i will add a two column section here

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,840
let's pick 50 percent width here

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,039
and i'll put in a couple of components

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
here

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,240
and by the way easy content ships with

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
all these components so you don't have

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,199
to start from scratch you can start

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
playing around with these components

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,479
which are commonly used on website so

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,919
for example we have an embed block

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,400
component

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,400
where i'll just embed a video

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
i'm putting this in the left column for

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
now uh

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,639
i'll pick another kind of common let's

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,440
pick social media i can bring in

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,440
a tweet here

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
i'll connect the tweet url

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
so as you can see i'm just configuring a

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
component like you would do in drupal

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
and placing all of these using the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
layout builder and i hit save so

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
after that in your typical drupal

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,759
workflow this is how your page will be

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
rendered

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
uh right now it is being rendered using

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
drupal's theme as you can see so in a

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
couple situations this is what you will

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
have

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,719
but you know if you have a completely

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
decoupled implementation you wouldn't

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,640
have this page on drupal right

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,240
uh you wouldn't have a drupal theme and

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,399
the front end will be rendered using

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,680
a js framework like gatsby angular or

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,680
react

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,760
but even with that you can still use the

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,120
layout builder to place these components

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
uh even though the front end will not

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,080
exist in drupal so

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
if i refresh my react page now that was

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,880
just created you'll see that the two

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
components that were placed

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
via the layout builder are available

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,519
here on the react page as well

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,760
so this page is completely decoupled

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,399
rendered through uh react all the html

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,480
css javascript is not coming from drupal

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
but still we are able to dictate how to

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
create this page

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
and we can do this without needing

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
developers right which in a typical

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
decoupler implementation you would need

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
developers to make these changes or

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
create such new pages

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
and it works completely it's fully

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
integrated with the layout builder so i

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
can

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
add more sections i can move these two

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
call

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
like i can create a new one column

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
section move these blocks into a one

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
column setup

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
or i can drag and drop so let's let's

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,399
just put the tweet on the left

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
let's put the embed blog on the right so

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,600
now the video should go to the right and

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,880
the tweet should be on the left

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
and as i'm making these changes of the

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,839
layout builder they get reflected on my

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,279
react application as well so this it's

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
solving one of the problems that rhys

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,160
mentioned right ability to use a drag

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
and drop interface

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,360
with a decoupled application so

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
you'll see that the tweet has gone to

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
the left and the video is on the right

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
uh i'll quickly show you one more

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,800
feature which is again very useful

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
uh that reese mentioned you know ability

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,399
to preview unpublished content

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
so easy content also ships another

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
content type called article

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
so let's pick an article which is

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
unpublished as you can see the status as

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,240
this article is unpublished

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
and i'll go to the edit note form now

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
again when you're in a completely

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
decoupled situation

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,240
there is no straightforward way to

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,519
preview this unpublished piece of

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,160
content

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,920
this is unpublished of course you know

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
you wouldn't want your site visitors

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,600
to see this draft but how do cms users

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
view this so

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,959
there's a special button at the top

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
which is

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
which says preview and if i click on it

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
i'm able

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
i will be able to view this page on my

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,560
react application

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,079
even though this is unpublished because

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,399
it has this unique hash key

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
at the end of the url it's like a

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
password which only people who

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
have access to the cms and who are

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,160
logged in and who click through this

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,760
button can

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,120
can uh get to right so as an editor i

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
can still preview this

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
and if a site visitor comes to your site

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
of course they will not have this

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
key because they don't have access to

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,519
that button uh they will see a four zero

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
three access to that as expected so

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
you're still able to maintain your rate

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,880
over workflows uh

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
keep your content secured but you're

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,320
giving the

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,399
site editors some ability to preview and

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,000
publish content so it's again solving

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,320
one of the uh common use cases and

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
i'll quickly wrap up and we want to you

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
know have at least a minute or so for

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,279
the question so

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
uh just wrapping up the demo you know

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,079
there are a lot of road map items which

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
are available on the project page as

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,880
well so we are working on video

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
transcriptions next

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
uh text to speech features so that you

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
can automatically create podcasts out of

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
your articles

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,839
all that's part of the smart article and

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
then of course we'll continue adding

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,240
components

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
if you want to get into more detail as i

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
mentioned you know please stop by our

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
booth

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
we are there for the whole day and would

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
love to talk more about

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,279
easy content and there are a bunch of

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,399
other talks that the sweden team has

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
been giving that are available on the

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
video library so please do check them

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
out

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,120
and uh feel free to drop by a booth for

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,240
any questions or reach out to

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,959
me or camel uh i'll just quickly glance

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,320
and see

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:14,240
if there were any questions right here

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,480
thanks carl uh glad that you liked it

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
uh anybody else if has any questions

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
anything

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,720
we have two three minutes to discuss

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,000
that

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
uh otherwise i'll see if i can post in

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
some links as well

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
to the projects

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:39,600
so this is this region booth where we

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:42,880
are hanging out the whole day so

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
uh no melissa i mean uh it should not be

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
a problem

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,279
uh so we are supporting for example if

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
specifically talking about decoupled

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,959
implementation we are supporting uh

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
paragraphs so the article content

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,720
that i showed works with paragraphs it

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,600
works with all the fields regular fields

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
that you have

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,399
and we also support blocks which you

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
would use typically with the layout

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,560
builder so i think we

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,200
have uh the common things covered with

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,519
blocks

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,120
uh your typical fields and paragraphs so

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,160
there shouldn't be any problem with your

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
custom content types

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,000
if if you were referring to the

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
decoupled piece melissa but if it was

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
something else then let us know

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,160
uh work with workflow yes absolutely so

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
uh what i showed you was a very simple

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,440
workflow that we had

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,399
wherein you have an uh draft and then

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,480
you can archive content so if i go back

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
uh it is implemented with the workflow

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,040
yes you should that's exactly why we are

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,639
building this so that you can retain

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,639
your drupal workflow

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,760
whatever model you're using and still

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
have it work with the decoupled

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
implementation

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,240
so michael it was all due to that

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,000
hash key that i showed you that's a

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
quick you know clever way to achieve

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that so

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,160
uh because once you log into drupal uh

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you get access to a unique link

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
and with that the react application is

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
using that hash key to make these calls

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
right

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,760
and it's bypassing the 403 access deny

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
and everybody else of course will not be

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,120
able to see that

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,800
unpublished piece of content and

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
yeah we'd love to talk more about any of

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
these questions so kamala and i will be

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
heading over to our booth immediately

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,800
after this

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,959
uh yeah come on page hit the link as

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
well to the booth expo so

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,320
anybody who wants to just have a

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
follow-up conversation please uh hop on

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,120
to the booth

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,199
or you can stop by anytime during the

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
day somebody from our team will be there

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
throughout the day so

thank you again everybody for joining in

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,079
