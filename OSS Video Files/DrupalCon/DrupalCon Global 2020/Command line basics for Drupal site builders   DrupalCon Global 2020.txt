boom you should be in command line

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,440
basics for drupal site builders that's

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,719
the topic right now

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,240
um so let's just jump in

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,440
my name is tara king i am here i work

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,960
for pantheon

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
as our developer outreach manager and

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,160
what that means is i get to go into the

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
drupal community

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
and sort of meet people hear what

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
they're struggling with

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
um bring pantheon to them bringing them

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
to pantheon that kind of thing

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,359
uh super love this job it's really

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
awesome you can find me

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,559
all over the internet as sparklingrobots

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
and

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,399
my emails here if you have any questions

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
after the talk uh when i'm not giving

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
talks at drupalcon

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
i really like reading big fiction fan

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,600
i also co-organize a board gaming

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
convention which is sadly not happening

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
right now because of all the things uh

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
and i'm also a big advocate for

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,120
diversity and inclusion in foreign open

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
source soccer communities

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
unsurprisingly specifically the drupal

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,120
community um

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
i'd love to hear from you all kind of

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
what you're interested in learning today

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,080
um where you're at in your drupal

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
journey how much command line experience

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
you have so don't be shy about putting

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,680
that in the chat

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
i'm going to talk a little bit about my

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,240
history um

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
so right now i work at pantheon but i am

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
a fully self-taught developer

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
and i started because i was actually

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
building html templates

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,840
on diary land back in 1999 i don't know

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
if anybody even remembers that website

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,119
but um you know totally self-taught like

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,240
viewing source on strangers web pages

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
and like

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,280
copying html out and learning myself so

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
um that's kind of how i got started and

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
then i got into print design

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
and i thought to myself oh i'll be a

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
front end developer

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,280
i i don't know why i thought this i had

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,560
no computer science background

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
um and i was gifted a drupal site at one

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
point um

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
for my dance company and so i was the

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
admin for the site we didn't have money

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,399
to pay somebody else so anything i

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
wanted to make it look better i had to

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
figure out

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
anything i wanted to change the way that

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,759
it was you know displaying content i had

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,520
to figure it out

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,000
and this site was a drupal 6 site

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
so from there that basically got me

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
started on the path

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
to becoming a developer and before i

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
worked at pantheon i was a senior drupal

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,800
developer at universal music

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
so i've kind of worked everything from

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,760
like small freelance up to the biggest

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,319
companies

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
and um i would say the one thing that

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,319
really

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,040
kind of launched my career uh in drupal

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,560
was

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,280
finally getting comfortable with the

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,879
command line it kind of opened up some

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,879
developery type skills that i didn't

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,400
have as a site builder

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,920
and i don't think that you have to

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
become a developer

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,720
because you've learned the command line

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
i think site builders can use these

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,800
tools they're not just for developers

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
so that's where this talk really came

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
out of so this talk is really for people

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,120
who are

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
um building sites but are maybe

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
not comfortable with development tools

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
or even developers who aren't

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
controlling the command line

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
so i'm gonna just quickly scan through

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
some of this stuff here

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,800
hold on i think there's some noise on my

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,280
side i'm gonna mute for just one moment

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:19,840
[Music]

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,840
all right am i gonna

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,440
not too loud um so it looks like not a

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,959
lot of command line experience

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
cool uh kristin hi kristen i know you um

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,000
this is awesome thanks for the feedback

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,280
that helps me kind of

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400
customize the talk um so let's just get

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,760
started we are going to start with the

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,799
very very very basics

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
of the command line um just to make sure

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
that everybody's kind of starting at the

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
beginning

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,920
so what is the command line

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,519
a lot of people think that it is this

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,959
it's just like numbers and letters

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,439
flying through space makes you look like

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,319
a super cool hacker it is unfortunately

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,080
not that it's really just this which is

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,080
a window on your computer

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,560
um it's basically just a place

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
where you type commands to the computer

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
i really appreciate the simplicity of

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,040
this quote

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,480
the command line is at its heart simply

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,479
a place where you type commands

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,079
to the computer so i remember when i was

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,280
learning kind of

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
why why should i do this right i already

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,520
have what we call

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
uh graphical user interface this is your

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,360
default

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
machine like if you have a macbook or a

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
windows machine

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
there's windows you can move around and

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
it's basically visual metaphors for how

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,919
you interact with a computer right

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
super easy to use but sometimes it

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,880
doesn't have as much

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
power as much customization as you might

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,759
want um the command line is a text-based

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
way of interacting with the computer

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
and because you don't have to build out

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
these visual metaphors there's a lot of

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,680
power and sort of sophistication with

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479
what you can ask for the command line to

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
do

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,120
so why would you learn the command line

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
instead of just using the interface

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,639
graphical user interface it's a lot

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
faster

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
um if you think of installing a module

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
you're going to want to go to the

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
browser you're going to need to log in

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
you're going to have to navigate to the

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
modules page add the module enable

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
module maybe it takes two minutes

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
right if you're doing it on this the

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
command line

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,080
you're going to need to open the

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
terminal maybe authenticate and then run

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
a single command

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,360
so it's maybe 30 45 seconds and when you

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
start to look at that

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039
uh task that you're doing every single

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
week or if you're multiplying it by 10

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,240
sites or 100 sites

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,759
that can really add up right so

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,440
even if you're just doing site building

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
stuff and not

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
writing fresh new code this stuff is a

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
really really powerful time saver

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
it's also really efficient if you ask

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
the command line to do something a

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
thousand times it'll do it a thousand

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
times the same way whereas if you ask

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
yourself to do something a thousand

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
times

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
i'm gonna go out in a limb and say you

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
might not do it every single time

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
exactly the same way once you start

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
getting into command line

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,680
tools you can also get into heavier

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
automation

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,400
so you can start writing bash scripts

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,759
you can start automating your updates

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
there's a lot of powerful stuff here

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,919
that doesn't require writing

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
php code or anything like that so that's

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
really exciting

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,919
and of course you do look awesome every

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,680
time you have the command line open and

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,280
somebody sees you doing something

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,520
super advanced even if it's actually

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
really simple so

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,800
let's go on to have a brief warning for

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
you

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
be careful on the command line it's not

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
inherently more dangerous it's not

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
inherently scarier

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
but a lot of times when you're using the

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
graph your dragons is right nana

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
whenever you're using the graphical user

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,479
interface uh there's often a

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
confirmation pop-up that says are you

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
sure you want to reformat your hard

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
drive or

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,560
whatever uh the command line typically

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,680
has a lot fewer warnings

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,639
so you can delete quite a lot of files

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,560
very very quickly

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,319
uh yes as christian's saying very very

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
fast um there's an amazing

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,199
video on youtube uh where the pixar team

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,199
is talking about the time

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,880
an engineer accidentally ran a four

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
character command

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
that deleted almost all of toy story 2.

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,319
um

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,160
it's a pretty funny story and the happy

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
ending is that they had backups so

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
when you're working with the command

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
line just make sure you know what you're

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,919
doing this is not a

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,360
a good time to start copy pasting things

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,960
that you're finding on google

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,479
yep kristen knows the command and um

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,479
you know make sure you have a robust

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,400
backup in place so that in case

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,919
you know mistakes happen we're humans

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
totally fine for that to happen

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,880
you just want to make sure that you can

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,039
you know rewind if need be

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,160
but don't panic as the great douglas

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,520
adams might have said

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
don't panic it's gonna be fine uh

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
we're gonna show you a bunch of stuff

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
today that is non-destructive so you can

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
just

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,479
get warmed up on the command line before

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,520
you know removing a bunch of files so

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,440
let's get into that now

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
all right we're going to go through at

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
the beginning uh

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
file structure on the command line how

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,360
you navigate around how you open the

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
terminal window so this is very very

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
basics

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
this is also the kind of stuff that when

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
i was learning i didn't know how to

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,080
google

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,520
because i didn't know the proper

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,960
terminology for it so there's a lot of

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,479
vocabulary in this section

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
if you've never opened the terminal

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
window which is just that text box we

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
showed earlier

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
these are the pathways for mac ox mac os

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
and linux

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
uh you can do all of the same stuff that

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
i'm talking about on windows but it's a

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
slightly different sort of syntax so i

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,200
left it out we can talk later if you

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,560
have questions um and this is the

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
terminal which is also known as the

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,919
console or the shell

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
what happens when you open this app is

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,120
that you're going to get this window

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
again right just this big black

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,959
text box this is where you enter the

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
commands

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
and what you're seeing here is the

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
prompt so i'm going to go through

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
the different pieces of the prompt so

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,360
that uh when like i said again when

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
you're trying to google when you're

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
trying to learn this stuff on your own

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,880
you have the right vocabulary

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
so the prompt is uh often it'll show

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
your location in this case it's in a

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
projects folder

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,760
um and then there's a cursor that is

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
indicating where you're entering text

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,080
it's very much like any text editor

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
you've used before

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
then you have the command so this is the

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
action

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
this is you know what you want the

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000
computer to do

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
it typically is the very first thing

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,920
that you're going to enter

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
there's something called the argument

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
sorry i'm getting distracted by putting

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
funding chats um

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
then there's the argument which is the

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
location or the file that you want the

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
computer to act

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,519
on in this case rm stands for remove

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
and then if you pass up the argument of

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,640
food.txt it's going to remove the file

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
named foo.txt and then the last thing

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
and this is where the power of the

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,720
command line really starts to kind of

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
shine

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
is the flag or the option and this is

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,480
how how you want the computer to take

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,320
the action in the case of this command

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,240
dash f is forcible basically meaning

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
don't ask again just please delete the

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,800
file but you can have

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,320
a very large number of options that can

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
really help you customize

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
pass in certain information and we'll

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
see a bunch of examples of that later

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
i just wanted to show you this so that

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
you have sort of this format this

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
template prepared

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,800
and you'll start to recognize it i think

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,040
as we go through i do have a tutorial

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
listed here that is a really fantastic

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
um command line basics and at the end of

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
my slides i have a list of all the

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,320
resources i reference so

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
no need to you know panic about that

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,880
again don't panic

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
yes dress commands.com is awesome we

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
will be getting to dress stuff later so

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
this is what happens when you open up

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
your terminal

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
if you're familiar with text-based

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,040
role-playing adventures of the 80s

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
uh it's very very similar right you open

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
your terminal and you're in a

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
in a room in a directory right so from

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
there you're going to want to figure out

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,680
which directory you're in

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
because almost all commands are going to

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,800
be run relative to your current location

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,000
so the first thing you can do is run pwd

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,079
you just type in those three letters

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
hit enter and it's going to print your

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,959
working directory that means where you

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,560
are

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,480
are right now so um

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
this case prints out the folder that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,519
you're in and then let's say you want to

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
look around

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,040
the room that you're in so to speak uh

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,519
you'll use ls which is going to list the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,440
files in the directory so if we try this

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
it's going to output this list of like i

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
think it's 10

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,120
items but this isn't terribly helpful

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
right there's not a lot of information

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
about what these

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
are are they files are they directories

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
how big there's not a lot of information

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,279
there

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
so we are going to uh pass it some

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
options

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,800
so a and l are two options that are

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
available to you with the ls command a

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
stands for all

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
l is for long format and you'll notice

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
here

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
uh that our options are actually just

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,959
combined into one

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,480
dash al um saves you some key strokes

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,040
the command line is sort of

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,720
famously obsessed with uh reducing

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,720
number of keystrokes so it's very

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,160
compact and tight and when you run that

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
command you're going to get this total

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,360
page of gibberish

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,680
the first time i saw this i was

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
definitely a little overwhelmed

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,040
so we are going to

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
break this down into just two areas that

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
i think will give you a lot of the sort

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,800
of

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,360
uh linux unix style uh

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,959
conventions of the command line and then

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
we'll move on to more drupal specific

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,320
stuff

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,519
so first of all on the left side over

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
here there's this

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,560
puzzle that the computer is offering to

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
you

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,760
and if you can figure out this puzzle

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,200
you can alter any file on your system

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,320
it's very exciting

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,639
the first digit here is basically

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,000
uh directory versus file so if it's a d

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,440
it means it's a directory if it's a dash

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
it means it's a file

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
uh so that's pretty straightforward

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,279
then we have these repeating sets of

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,279
three digits rwx or r-x

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,200
each of these can be either the letter

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,160
or a dash and they stand for read write

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
and execute

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
these are the permissions files so if

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
you've ever run into something

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,880
where drupal is complaining that it

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
can't write a file because it doesn't

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,839
have sufficient permissions

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
or if you've ever seen like a stack

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
overflow post saying oh just change the

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,040
permissions to 700. change the

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,519
permissions of 777.

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,880
um this is how you actually can figure

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
out what the permissions are for any

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,959
given file

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,480
i'm not going to go too far down the

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,839
rabbit hole because there's literally

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
every side of this could probably be its

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,040
own mini presentation

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,720
um but the reason it repeats three times

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,399
is because there are three groups

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
there's the owner the group and then

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
there's everyone else which is literally

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
the entire internet

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
so uh you might think that you don't

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
ever want the internet to execute

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,399
something but actually you often want

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
them

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
the that for like a php process that

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,000
needs to be run

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,399
um so it's not always as intuitive as it

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,839
looks but uh again i have a resource for

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
this so if this is very interesting to

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,959
you it's

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,519
it'll be in the slides at the end

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,240
so we're back here at our ls we figured

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
out the left

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
far left side now we're going to look at

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,040
the far right side this is the same

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
information we saw

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,639
before it's just the file and directory

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
names that are contained within our

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,880
current working directory

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,880
we can also see if i left this it's kind

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
of tiny on the left side you can see the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,079
directory or file

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
so that's the other side that you really

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
are going to start using from the very

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
beginning

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
so now that we know where we are on the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
file system

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,639
we can change we can change into a

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,320
different directory so if we need to go

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
into the contrib folder

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
if we need to go into the modules folder

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
uh that is

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
as simple as cd and then the name of the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
location again

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
you're going to want to do that relative

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
to your current location in the file

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,160
system

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
if you want to remove a file rm

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,040
rmstyle.css

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
uh and without going into every linux

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
command that there is because that would

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,240
be exhausting for everyone um i just

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
wanted to kind of give you a few options

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
of what's out there so you can kind of

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
see

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,160
the basic concepts that are behind it uh

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,600
i do think google is a really powerful

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,760
tool like i said you don't want to just

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,839
copy paste from google into your machine

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,360
but i've definitely found tons of

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,120
articles that are

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,120
you know best way to unzip a file mac os

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,560
and it'll have like nine different ways

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
different options that you can pass

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
different results that you'll get by

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,399
doing that so i think there's a lot to

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,720
learn there

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,560
and then in the command line itself

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
there's something called the band page

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
the main page uh which is short for

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,600
manual

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,199
uh and if you run man and then the name

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
of the command it'll give you all kinds

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,000
of information about what options are

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,279
available to you

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,160
what the results are going to be it's

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,480
super helpful you can also pass in

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,759
help or dash h many times so that's a

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
great way to kind of

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,880
while you're still on the command line

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,800
continue learning about it

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,199
um since sometimes this stuff can be

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,959
like i said a little hard to google

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
uh because we are web developers i also

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,399
wanted to cover connecting to other

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,079
computers by the command line

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,160
um so all the stuff i talked about

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,920
you could run on your local computer

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
right now the laptop right in front of

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
you

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,079
but if you want to work on your hosts

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
files you're going to probably be

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,160
running into ftp sftp and ssh

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,000
i'm going to take these two at a time

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
ftp and sftp

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
are both file transfer protocols one of

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
them is secure so you can guess which

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,680
one i think is better

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
um and this is basically just moving

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,480
files around

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,399
so it's not an interactive shell which

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
is uh what ssh

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,240
is they're just ways of basically

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
moving files around renaming files that

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,320
kind of thing

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
ssh known as secure shell is basically

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,279
an interactive

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,920
session on the on the remote machine

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,199
just like you can do on your local

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
so that's typically when you want

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,360
command line access you might want ssh

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
i work for pantheon you have a slightly

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,639
different way of doing it

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,320
but typically that's that's the kind of

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
thing you want to do

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,680
and i will say that my very first

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,600
command line experience

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,079
i was very scared and then i was also

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,040
very proud of myself when i had done it

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,480
was uh creating an ssh key um we have i

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,160
have a link here to the pantheon docs

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,839
it's a super simple process that is not

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,920
pantone specific

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,920
as to how you actually do this process

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,120
but it basically enables you to clone

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,000
something down from

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,839
github or something like that and it's

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,039
very easy it's non-destructive

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,720
it takes five minutes tops um and then

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,160
you'll have used the command line so if

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,799
you've never done it before

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
i highly recommend just creating an ssh

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
key even if you don't upload it anywhere

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,880
just go in there

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,799
run the command like i said it's in the

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,199
docs here and i'll send the link out

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,199
um really easy way to get started

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
another common use case uh is version

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,360
control

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
which i do not have remotely enough time

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,799
to get into today

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,799
um but i wanted to kind of talk about

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
what version control is why developers

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
are obsessed with it

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,679
um i personally don't you don't have to

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
use the command line to use version

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
control it's my personal favorite way of

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,280
doing it but

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
um i'm guessing that you already have a

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,480
version control system

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:02,000
in place um so

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,840
you make a file microproject.text

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
cool and then you're working on it and

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,360
you think i've got a slightly better

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
version but it's not

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,799
i don't want to lose the first version

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,679
so now you have michaelproject2.txt

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,640
you do that same process you got

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,080
michaelproject3.txt

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
then you make a small change that makes

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,160
it enough to name it a new thing

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,039
but not enough to name it version four

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
so they have michaelproject3b.text

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,320
maybe then you send it to me for

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
feedback well i send it back to you with

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,840
my name on it because i want to make

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,160
sure you understand which version it is

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
then you send my feedback to steve and

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,080
steve puts his name on it because he saw

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,600
me do the same thing

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,559
it's getting exhausting now but now we

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
have my cool project final except you

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
definitely forgot there was a typo so

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,679
now it's final final

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
and then we have final final two last

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,280
change i promise i am guilty of this

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,799
um it is a version control system right

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,360
you have old version saved

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,240
it totally counts but i infinitely

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,360
prefer git

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,200
um git is basically an undo button

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,960
for your bad ideas for your bad work for

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
any mistakes you might make

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
as a site builder when i started using

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
git it was it

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,720
freed me up from a lot of anxiety uh

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
around let's say

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
i don't know how many of you were around

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
in the drupal get in days there was a

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,559
ton

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,120
of uh security scare big big scare i had

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,799
a bunch of sites that i was managing

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,039
thanks in the chat it was a traumatic

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,720
time for all of us um

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,720
and i was doing updates really really

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
quickly because i needed to get them

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,240
applied as soon as possible and i had so

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
much anxiety because i was worried that

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
i would apply something the site would

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
come down and i wouldn't know what

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
change had done it

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,679
um it's bad time so get

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,799
prevents all of that anxiety because

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,720
every change you make is

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
tracked in terms of who did it when they

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,240
did it and exactly which characters they

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,080
changed in which files on which lines

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,480
that's super powerful

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,200
that's all i'm going to say about it is

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
opaque

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,120
yeah i um have uh this has a swear word

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
in it

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,799
um i think this is a pretty awesome

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,200
resource for learning git

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,080
and i'd be happy to talk more about how

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,440
i learned to get

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
there's a lot of good resources out

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,720
there oh

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
all right i'm so sorry i think about

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
drupalgeddon it was a really terrible

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
time for all of us

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
i'm seeing some questions and i will uh

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,880
get to some of these for sure

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,080
i'll try to get to all of them so josh

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
i've been seeing josh talk

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,080
in the chat here josh

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,679
is uh i feel like i should know the

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,520
english major term for this

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,320
it's a word that is made of two parts of

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
in other words drupal and shell

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
and it is a command line interface for

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,640
drupal so

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,360
tasks that you might normally log into

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
uh

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
the drupal backend to update a module or

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
something like that

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
drush can do it for you uh by via the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,799
command line

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,760
and josh can do a whole lot more so it's

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
not just the

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
admin tools there's a bunch of other

00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
stuff and i think that's really what

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,600
pushed me as a

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,799
site builder into learning these tools

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,559
was uh

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,159
coming up against things and developers

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,840
would just say oh just use drush to do

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,240
that just use drush and i was like i'm

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,200
too scared of it i can't do it

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,120
um so let's just i'm gonna walk you

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,400
through again a couple sample

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,960
commands to kind of get your

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,600
juices flowing your inspiration going

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,960
and then we'll have time for questions

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,520
so uh drush user create

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,080
is a command that will create a user uh

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
this one

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
in this case so let's go back to our

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,760
initial

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,960
uh sort of vocabulary around how a

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,600
command is formed

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,280
the actual command is user create and

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
this basically says i want to use

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
drush to run the command so sometimes

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,799
you'll see the tool

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
appear before the command itself then

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,280
we're passing in the argument of terra

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,280
that's the username

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,360
that's going to be created and they're

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,559
passing in an option of mail

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,679
and um that's the mail uh the email

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,080
address that you want to use for that

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,880
account

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,679
you can also pass in password user role

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
there's like

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,760
25 different things you can do um this

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
is really helpful

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
if you have lost access to your admin

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
site

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
but you still have ssh access to your

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
site i've definitely seen people

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,840
use it for that it's also helpful if you

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,880
want to um

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,880
programmatically create or import users

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,799
from say like a csv file or some kind of

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
list you can use just to do that much

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,520
more quickly than you you

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
know clicking through hundreds of times

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,280
on the admin screen

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,600
you can also alter uh users

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,760
so a lot of just commands kind of have

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
uh the same base they like that a lot of

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
them affect the user

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
this one adds roles you can remove roles

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,640
you can delete users

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
this is adding the user and i'm sorry

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
the role admin

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,600
to the account using that email so

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
that's really handy

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
sometimes when you just want to update a

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,600
bunch of people really quickly

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,320
this one is a very simple command uli

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,960
well

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
when you type this in it will pass you a

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,919
link

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,440
to login to your site as uh whatever

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
user you have access as

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,360
so this can be really fast again if you

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,799
lose access to the admin side

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
or if you're just used to working in the

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,000
command line it's really nice to not

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,840
have to go and like

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,880
figure out where that admin screen is it

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
can be really speedy

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,880
you can use drush to download themes and

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
modules from drupal.org

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,919
in this case we're downloading croto

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,480
which is a new

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,840
admin theme and if you want to

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,080
superpower get a little bit

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
even more efficient you can actually

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,799
enable

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,039
the theme and if you haven't downloaded

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,559
it yet it'll ask you if you want to

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
and you can say yes i want to download

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,279
it or you can pass in this

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,720
flag of dash y which says just say yes

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,919
to any questions

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
if you don't really want to hear the

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
questions you just say yes to all of

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,720
them and so when it asks

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,000
do you want to download the theme it

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,679
will go ahead and do that for you and

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
then it will also enable it so

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
if you're used to going into the admin

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,799
screen and doing this by hand i think

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,400
this i don't know 15 characters here can

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,919
do that same job for you

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,919
like that it's really really really

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,520
speedy

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,159
i'm definitely hearing seeing some stuff

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
in the chat about config management on

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,400
drupal

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,760
um if you don't understand the basics of

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,880
config management yet

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,720
my colleague david neem did an awesome

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
config management for beginners this

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,840
morning and it'll come up when they put

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
the stuff i'm not sure when the videos

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,799
are going to be posted

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
it involved costume changes but

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,520
basically what this does

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
is it takes uh settings that are stored

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
in the database

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,000
pushes them to a file that you can then

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
uh

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
basically put into version control and

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
import onto

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,120
your live site or you know if you're

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
using multiple development environments

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,880
i think this was a huge win in drupal 8.

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,720
it's part of drupal 9 as well

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
no offensive features much easier to use

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,320
than features in drupal 7.

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,760
so josh can do config import config

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,760
export a bunch of other stuff as well

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,120
you can also update drupal core or any

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
modules themes that you want to update

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
dress up drupal will get that done for

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
you um obviously

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
this could be a bit destructive you

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
always want to make sure with updates

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
that you're doing

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,159
sufficient testing and that kind of

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,559
thing but uh it is super

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,200
super fast much easier than the old

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
method of

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,799
like downloading a bunch of files

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,679
unzipping them into a location

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,679
yada yada yada

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,120
and then in terms of things that i think

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,960
are super awesome and um

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,360
are kind of a pain to do on your own

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,919
drush can also sanitize your database

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,960
so it can remove user passwords um

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,679
personal information

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,120
all kinds of stuff that i think we

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,559
should do more of in drupal we should be

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,159
more sensitive with the information when

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,960
we're cloning databases from environment

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,799
to environment

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,559
and josh will do that sanitization for

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,480
you um obviously

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
again a destructive command so you don't

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
want to be running this just on

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,720
live that would be could be very

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,720
upsetting for some people

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,799
uh drushcommands.com also got put in the

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,799
uh chat here

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,640
is an awesome resource for learning all

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,600
of the josh commands that are available

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
to you

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,000
um drush was really the thing that

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,679
pushed me to understand the command line

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,120
it just seemed invaluable i heard so

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,360
many good things about it

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,240
so i would highly recommend giving this

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,720
a try

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,200
uh the documentation on that website has

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,440
how to install it on your local machine

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
a lot of drupal friendly hosts um

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,039
pantheon aqua have brush installed or

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,799
you can generally install it yourself

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,799
so highly recommend getting started with

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,799
drush

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,480
and of course you know the command line

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,080
is an incredibly powerful tool i have

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
never ever ever regretted learning

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,039
more about it um like i said i think it

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,559
kind of unlocked a lot of doors for me

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,960
it does take some persistence and

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,120
curiosity but you're all here at the

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,559
very last hour of drupalcon global which

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
was a 12-hour event

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,919
so i'm guessing you have a lot of

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
persistence and curiosity so i'm sure

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,919
you will be able to learn

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,080
uh all of these cool tools and of course

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,520
you know once you get started it's like

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,200
there's always just one more thing to

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,679
learn it's a sort of

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,559
endless rabbit hole but composer is

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
something that is

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,880
definitely not going away in the drupal

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,600
space and i think um

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
for site builders it requires it

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,200
requires a lot of command line knowledge

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,440
and it can be very intimidating

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
um but i think it's definitely learn you

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
know something you can learn

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
triple console is really cool uh you can

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
use

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,120
bash scripting which is just writing

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,360
little scripts that will run

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,039
run a series of commands for you you can

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,640
use docker and make docker work better

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
for you so there's a lot

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,039
uh out there and i just wanted to kind

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:39,120
of give a very ground level

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,760
understanding of what what's possible

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,399
as i said my slides are here please let

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
me know if this

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,440
like doesn't work i tested it earlier

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,480
but sometimes i have issues with hillary

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,520
links

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,600
this has i'll skip forward briefly but

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,679
it has this exact list of resources in

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,200
it so you can go and learn

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,039
about any of the concepts we talked

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,760
about in more depth um

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,360
so with that i have about 15 minutes

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,520
left for questions i'd be

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
delighted to take any questions you have

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,679
um

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
again thank you so much i and thank you

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,000
to pantheon for sponsoring me to be here

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,799
and to give talks like this uh feel free

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
to reach out to me

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,159
on twitter or anywhere at robots

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
i'm going to take a moment to scroll

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,290
back and see if i've missed any

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
questions and feel free to type stuff in

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:31,840
[Music]

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,840
as as needed

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,840
looks like we have a nice like wide

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
range of experience here so that's fun

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,520
all right

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,399
i'm gonna plug in my wi-fi so that i

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,679
don't lose internet in the middle of the

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,840
session that'd be very upsetting for

00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,840
everyone

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
okay

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,240
a resource for learning how drupal works

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,559
and what dress commands correspond to

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
what

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,279
hunter asked that question as ruby put

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
in the chat drushcommands.com is the

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,080
best location

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,360
for kind of just a resource for that

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,440
information

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,440
um it will

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:30,080
it's it's very command line uh

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,039
like it's a little bit terse i guess

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,200
it's a little sparse

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,240
in terms of what exactly it all does but

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,880
it is there

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,320
um and i think it's really the best way

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,720
to get started and

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,600
generally if you're thinking i wonder if

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,960
you can

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,200
it's in there it has a great search

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
function so you can type in uh you know

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
the word

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,120
user and it'll show you everything

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,720
that'll act on the user

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,159
entity type in drupal so that's really

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
cool

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,279
i hope that helps um

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,640
but that's the best resource for sure

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,399
jurassic park reference from anna

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
roberts yay

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,039
commands like cr refuse uh confuse me

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,159
also what cache is getting rebuilt

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,000
um as as ruby's saying it is basically

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,840
uh drupal's cache so drupal has its own

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,399
internal caching mechanism

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
so drush cr will uh basically dump and

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,520
rebuild that cache

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,960
uh for you um the reason it has to be

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,440
done after other steps is

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
uh too broad of a subject but i think

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
that in in some circles

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,480
certainly as i was coming up in drupal

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,200
um

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,399
it was like a magical invocation that

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,240
wizards would do

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,399
they would run some commands and then

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,279
they would run drush cc which is the old

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,240
version and

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,559
rr which is another old thing um because

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,559
it just kind of like

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,919
checks it dumps any old information and

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,279
just checks to make sure everything is

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,200
as expected

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,480
um so it's non-destructive you know it's

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
not really a problem you can always run

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
it and it usually does

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,799
eliminate other possibilities of you

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,799
know perhaps outdated data being stored

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,080
somewhere

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,360
all right still scrolling

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
charles thank you for that awesome

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,559
drupalize me link drupalize me is a

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,840
wonderful resource

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,840
for learning more about this stuff

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,000
julianne asks uh one problem i ran into

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,279
with version control and drupal

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,279
is that many ui changes are stored in

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,720
the database rather than file system

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,080
any recommendations and this is on

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,320
drupal 7. um

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,840
features module is what i would

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,559
recommend for drupal 7.

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
um if anybody else is i haven't actively

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
worked on a drupal 7 site in a while so

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,559
if anybody else has a different

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,559
suggestion please drop it in the chat

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,919
but uh features module basic uh

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,760
basically

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,360
lets you kind of pull configuration into

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
its own custom module that you can then

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
kind of

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,600
commit to version control and move from

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,279
system to system um

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,960
drupal 8 uses configuration management

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,600
which is that josh command i was showing

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,880
you

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,760
um but it is an oddity of drupal 7 and i

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
think it's why the

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,880
configuration management system was

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
built to kind of

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
get around what is otherwise a pretty

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
thorny problem in terms of

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,799
moving the database merging a database

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,200
is a really complicated thing so

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,039
um still scrolling

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
yup i see some references to that port

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,279
round two portmanteau thank you kristen

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,720
for

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,919
clarifying my english major uh

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,120
forgetfulness okay we're trying to

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,399
create a test environment so we aren't

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,760
always making changes production want to

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,840
push for those changes to test or

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,320
production

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,919
yeah drupal 7 features module um it is

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,640
definitely the best way i would actually

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,919
julienne

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,360
um it's not talked about very much

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,799
because we have a new system but if you

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,799
would go back to drupalcon's

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,000
like los angeles probably there will be

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,679
recordings on youtube on the drupal

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,120
association channel of people talking

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,399
about features it was a huge part of

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,840
drupal and drupal 7.

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,000
so there's still a ton of resources out

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,000
there they're just kind of um

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,559
not happening live anymore but it is

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
really helpful

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
i'm seeing a lot of frustration around

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,039
features i'm sorry it is hard

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,399
it's i think the best way to do it

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,360
you see some hatred for composer

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,360
composer's pretty rough i do agree

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,480
uh terra's tell of the douglas adams

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,399
universe might be the nicest thing

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
anyone has ever said to me

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,930
could i share the slides i did i'll show

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
the link again

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:25,840
[Music]

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,840
um sorry gotta grab it

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,880
awesome christina says i wish you did i

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
had you to explain this to me years ago

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,120
i made this talk for myself years ago so

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,159
i wish i couldn't do it too

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,760
um all right

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,519
yes i would absolutely love uh

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,919
for people to fill out the the survey

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,679
monkey just i give this talk i can't

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,799
as well so it helps me to always improve

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,159
it and hear what's working for you what

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,399
isn't working for you

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,039
uh can i talk a little bit on using

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,240
drush in multi-site

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,000
the frank answer is no i haven't ever

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,640
done it i have not used a lot of

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
drupal multi-site um if somebody else

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,200
has thoughts i'd be happy to open the

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,159
floor on the stage or

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,159
you put it in cat in

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,599
the chat of course ruby wants to know

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,879
why josh and orlando seem to break if i

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,320
don't use them for a month

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,560
trying to think if i know the answer to

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
that

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,079
the mysteries of the command line i

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,639
don't know

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,639
i would guess

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,760
possibly one of them is updating and the

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,000
other one's not and they have conflicts

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,879
but that's totally just pulling

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,879
something out of thin air

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,720
does pantheon have a sort of

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
step-by-step instruction on command line

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,119
instructions

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,200
specific to the hosting environment

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,280
slash local environment we absolutely

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,399
do um pantheon is a very opinionated

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,440
platform

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,839
and um

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,320
see trying to pull up our docs

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,599
uh so i don't know how i don't want to

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,480
go too far into the film make sure it's

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,160
still sort of

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,359
helpful for everyone but i'll drop some

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,560
links in here free anastasia

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,720
uh command line is addictive i

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,520
absolutely agree

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,119
all right is there a sandbox to practice

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,240
cli without worrying about

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:31,839
breaking anything i think that there

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,839
is um let me grab the link for you

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,920
a lot of the stuff um if you're just

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,760
like

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,119
um this one doesn't have

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,800
a sandbox

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,119
you can definitely navigate around

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,520
without um

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,200
any like real danger it's when you start

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,680
running like remove

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,359
commands or drush commands which are

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,240
substantially more complicated than

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,200
navigation commands but uh this i just

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,599
dropped the link and that hopefully will

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,040
be helpful to you melanie

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,880
follow up on version control of drupal

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,760
is there a better solution for drupal 9

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,720
i'm

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,320
guessing that you're asking specifically

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,560
about the database

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,000
uh complication of moving between

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,599
environments

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,920
configuration management is the best

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,839
thing for drupal 9 it's

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,200
it makes yaml files which are just

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,320
basically text files that

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,599
indicate what the different settings

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,119
should be that you can then import and

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
export really easily

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,960
and um it's not perfect but it's pretty

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,160
darn good

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,160
honestly i really like it

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,320
all right sorry i'm like way behind in

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,240
the chat uh so i'm sorry if i'm

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,079
missing something uh drush versus drupal

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,480
console which one and why

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,440
um drupal console at least last time i

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,119
looked at it

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,160
uh is more of a scaffolding tool

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,920
so if you're writing drupal modules it

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,119
will scaffold them out it will create

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,320
the files you need

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,320
which is super awesome uh brush i feel

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,240
is more of a like

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,599
maintenance tool like uh when you're

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,440
actually working on a site

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,760
it can do things make the dribble site

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,160
do certain things uh

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
that's my i have not used drupal console

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,440
all that much

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,560
so i would not take this as gospel truth

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,640
but that was certainly my

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,839
um understanding of the two tools so i

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,359
would say josh and

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,880
drupal console rather than verses i

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,640
think they're

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,280
complementary tools rather than

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,280
competitors

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,800
all right good good questions

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,240
um awesome thank you so much um

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,000
i will be at the pantheon booth i will

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,520
be at the drupal diversity booth

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,839
i'm happy to talk to my online stuff

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,560
like literally anytime because

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,440
i find it very addictive and exciting so

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,240

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,520
