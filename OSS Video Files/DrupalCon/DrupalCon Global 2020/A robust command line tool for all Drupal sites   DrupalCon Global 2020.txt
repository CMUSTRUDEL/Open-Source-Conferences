	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
i think we should get started

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:16,240
all right welcome to a robust command

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,400
line tool for all drupal sites a little

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,039
bit about me before we get started

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,760
um i'm old uh

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
old on this project uh since the year

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,679
that it was born

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:35,120
uh 2001 i've been a core contributor

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,399
so uh that's kind of unique

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,840
um i've started a bunch of projects that

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,640
you might have heard of

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
in the drupal community

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
groups.drupal.org

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,920
the drupal code of conduct drupal 7 con

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
trib experience um and then recently

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
drupal spoons and

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,160
drupal test traits and

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,480
i am the maintainer of dresh the devel

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
project

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
also a member of the drupal security

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
team

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,560
um okay

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,960
uh we have a pretty short agenda because

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,240
this is intended as a conversation

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,840
um i'll invite you guys to ask questions

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,080
on chat and um or just come and join

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,759
uh via voice and screen that would be

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,799
great too

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,479
um so uh

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
here we go we're going to talk about uh

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,360
the current cli world

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,320
um as it pertains to drupal core

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
and then as it pertains to all of the

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
drupal sites

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,920
that we are building and running

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,040
for clients and for ourselves

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,560
um we'll talk about my proposal uh

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,360
as part of this um presentation

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
um it's kind of a new proposal i hope

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,320
you like it

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,759
um it's a composer-based approach

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,439
of getting drush into every new drupal

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
site

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,560
which is to add the drush package to the

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
drupal

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
recommended project package

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
and we'll talk about some of the

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
benefits and considerations involved

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,959
with that proposal

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,080
and then open it up for discussions

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,680
okay so um here's a quick slide

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,480
of some uh cli commands that are

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,840
triple core um these are implemented as

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,000
symfony console commands

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,239
um and uh there's just a few of them

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,440
and the implementations in them are

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,319
actually quite

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,760
uh basic um there's the db dump command

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,360
which only works for the mysql database

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,120
and it doesn't support a lot of the

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
stuff that um

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
sql dump does in dresh you can't pick

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,560
which tables to dump you can't

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,840
add extra command line options for

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
for my sql dom um and lots of other

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,440
stuff

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
um that command exists basically to

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
facilitate

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
creating dumps that are used during the

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,360
test suite

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,800
um the install command

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
actually only works with sqlite database

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
and it doesn't support multi-site

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,760
profile fields

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,159
lots of stuff that site install supports

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,599
in direct

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,840
and there's a server command uh where

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,480
you can quickly spin up a

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
php-based web server um that command is

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
really analogous to

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,120
the run server command and rush um

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,519
and that's all we have um there's a long

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
uh ticket which uh doug greene

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
referenced

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,120
where people say we should have um a

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,080
command line tool in core

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
um i partially agree with that statement

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,400
and

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,400
you know later on i say how i propose to

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
fulfill that um

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:16,320
so uh this is drupal core um

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,519
this is how uh drupal sites get built

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,720
nowadays

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,840
um per our documentation

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,160
um so uh you start out with

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
composer create project and you pass an

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,639
argument drupal

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
recommended project um

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,240
if people aren't yet familiar with

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
recommended project

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,919
it is a slimmed down version of what we

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
used to use called the drupal dash

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,520
project um

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,800
and it is it gets you drupal core

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,759
um and some scaffolding plugins

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,919
um and some like getting started

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
documentation and so forth so

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,479
this is how you build um a composer

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,000
based site now

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,600
um some people i'm sure are still using

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
drupal dash project

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
um but that's not what the docs tell you

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,720
to do

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,160
um the next step that most people do

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,600
um is composer require address rush

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,479
um and they're doing that because

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,160
they need to do a site install they need

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,479
to enable disable modules etc

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
they need to log in as any user import

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,840
configuration

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,280
check their site's security for

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,639
either drupal releases or php

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,919
essays or they need to deploy their site

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
into a new environment

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,199
um that's a new command that comes with

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,520
um

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,479
trush 10. um

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,360
yeah so uh i see doug mentioned required

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
dev

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
um that's not my recommendation but

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
let's not get off track talking about

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
that

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,280
um we have sql sync sql query

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
rsync lots of other stuff that people

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,919
need

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,759
um and clearly nobody really needs

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,800
everything that's in rush

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,759
but enough people need a thing

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
that it's in there and there's no venn

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,160
diagram

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,039
that includes exactly all the things you

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
need

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,919
um and a very small set um

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,919
so that's why i don't think that the um

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,420
core ticket is really going to work out

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
where we build a few key commands

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,800
[Music]

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800
let's keep going um someone asked in the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
chat about drupal console

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
um jesus the maintainer of that project

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,560
posted recently on twitter

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,400
about the status of drupal console um

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,479
he said that it was on hiatus um

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,599
and uh that makes sense because it

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,759
really hasn't had

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,960
changes significant changes in a very

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
long time

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,440
um so there's really only one actively

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
maintained

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
cli tool for drupal

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,880
okay so um here we lay out the proposal

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
that was in the agenda

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
step one add drushdrush to the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,960
recommended project

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
um the effect of doing that is that

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,840
everyone's gonna get

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
a command line tool along with their

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,400
dress at the beginning of their project

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
okay um i really think that's the right

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,120
way to go

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,160
um for for drupal

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
um drupal has you know

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
had this ticket where people are saying

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,120
we need a command line tool in core

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,319
for a long time and i think the

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
recommended project

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
actually gives us a way to cut this

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,160
gordian knot

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
where some people wanted to put dress in

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,080
some people wanted to build from scratch

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,800
in drupal core um but now we can just

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
put drush

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
into recommended project and not into

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
drupal slash core

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,520
um and i think that satisfies the

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,199
different concerns involved

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,199
um as for the three commands that i

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
listed a few slides earlier

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
db dump command and install command and

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,680
server command

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,479
um those can stay in drupal core as they

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
are

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,680
um my vision is that

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,080
drupal core uses symphony console

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
commands to the extent it needs them for

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,120
testing itself

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,959
um to the extent that they're useful

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,399
for end users i think that

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,240
people can use the existing drush

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,279
commands that come with recommended

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
project

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,120
that would be my proposal to how to

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
proceed

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,680
um and you know i'm really happy that

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,279
recommended project came along and i

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,200
think it's a great place to put

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,560
brush and it may be a great place to put

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
a few other things

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,480
um so uh

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,000
you know let's list out some of the

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,920
benefits that the proposal gives

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,360
first one out of the box experience um

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,399
we will have achieved the

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
goal or the title of this presentation a

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
robust command line tool

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,519
for all drupal sites okay

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,720
um it's pretty frustrating

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:34,560
to install uh drupal

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,480
and not have this um and you have to go

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
into the documentation you have to

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,279
figure out that oh this tool which is

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,480
sometimes mentioned and sometimes not

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,120
um is what i need

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
um and so you know the out of the box

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
experience is far

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,279
and away improved once we make this

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
small change

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,880
once we have an expectation that drush

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,880
comes along with drupal for new projects

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
we can make our documentation consistent

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
if you go through and you look at the

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
install docs for drupal they're pretty

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
schizophrenic

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,160
um as to how drupal should be installed

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
i think we can start making better

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
decisions

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
when dress site install is assumed to be

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,800
available

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,800
um at least you know in the default case

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
so this gives a pretty good signal to

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
contrib commands

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
that they're welcome and encouraged to

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
ship with

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,200
drush commands um right now

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,640
uh you know they have to decide if they

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
want no commands

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,640
symphony console commands drupal console

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
commands

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,680
or um drash commands um

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,880
so i think the signaling could be much

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
improved with this proposal

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
the security of drupal sites will be

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,120
improved by this proposal

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,320
um drush ships with

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
both pm security and pm security dash

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,959
php commands

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,399
um those are ways in which

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,399
sites can verify uh

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,800
that they don't have um insecure modules

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
and insecure php dependencies

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,279
um the insecure modules part is also

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
covered by the update module

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,680
um so perhaps that's not as important

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,240
but the insecure php dependencies

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,120
is really important and i venture to say

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,480
that not many drupal sites are actually

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,200
monitoring their php dependencies and

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
with drush now they can and with drush

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
built

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,240
into recommended project we will have a

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,279
lot better compliance with this

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
important

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,760
pr this practice okay

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,519
um i want to mention that

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,560
uh drupal deployment is

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,399
like a completely ignored topic in the

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,440
drupal documentation

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,200
um we document

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
some of the steps that have to happen

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
during deployment um

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,360
update db or update.php in in

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,410
drupal core terms config

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
import cache rebuild

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,720
[Music]

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,360
but the real uh process is not well

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
documented

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,040
drush now has a deploy command which

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
standardizes how you're supposed to do

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,920
deployments

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,360
um or at least it gives a best practice

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,480
if people want to do something different

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
that's totally fine um so i think that

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
that

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,959
best practice in recommended project

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
will really help um smooth out some of

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,760
the problems people have with

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,560
adopting drupal um

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,040
and then there's just the common sense

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,680
um

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,519
idea that you know russia is over 10

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,440
years

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
it's quite popular it's not going

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,720
anywhere and

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,519
it seems particularly foolish

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,279
or stubborn or something i'm not sure

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
what the right adjective is

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
to start rebuilding even part of it in

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,959
drupal core

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
when we have this recommended project

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
that we can put

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
you know modules that or packages that

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,839
we think are

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,839
useful for new drupal sites in it

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
i know you guys are like going wild in

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200
the chat um

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
i will try to read it uh when i get a

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
chance but i want to get through the

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,079
slides and then have discussion

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,560
um okay so um here's some further

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,320
considerations about the proposal

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,600
um whenever we start

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,040
um depending on a new package

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,320
um we have a bunch of considerations

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,720
um and so this is no different um

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
release management um needs to be

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,760
coordinated between drupal and rush

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,519
um and you know i can tell you as the

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,600
drush maintainer that

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,199
i'm committed to being the best

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,519
uh you know following all the best

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,760
practices there and being as good as the

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,880
best dependency that drupal has

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,519
um so if we really like how we

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,279
coordinate with php unit or with

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
symphony

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,560
or with you know any of the other

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
dependencies um

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
you know i'd love to follow that model

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,000
um

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
the security team needs to coordinate

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,480
with the the dependencies of drupal

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,320
um and you know as a member of the

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
security team i have pretty good feel

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,320
for how that works and i'm

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,440
committed to making that happen um

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,360
you know drush is not proposed to be a

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
dependency of drupal slash core but it

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,199
is

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
proposed to be a dependency of the

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,120
recommended project so i think all of

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,320
these things still apply

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,800
um drupal core and drush will have

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,839
separate issue queues and repositories

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,639
um i don't see that as a problem i think

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,120
that

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,320
you know in our modern php world people

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
are used to

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
having their application built by a

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
number of different projects

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,279
that have different issue queues and

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
repos this would be

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
just like it's always just like it's

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,680
always been

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,720
um i understand there would be

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,240
so there would be um

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,760
some benefits to having everything in

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,720
the same queue

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,160
um issue cue but uh i don't think that

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,079
um

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,880
that's the way it's proposed um

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,199
people uh have brought up um testing

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,639
before it's an important concept

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,160
um and i wanna say that drush is

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,199
tested with drupal um really thoroughly

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
um we test with multiple php versions

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,079
multiple core versions

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
multiple db back-ends and drupal is

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
never

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,800
mocked out of our tests um and that

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
distinguishes

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,560
us from drupal console we use a real

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,839
drupal in our tests

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,360
and so we we download it with composer

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,800
and we know when our commands

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
are no longer working with drupal

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
because they're actually working with

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
drupal in the test

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,839
um you know our tests suffer uh

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,959
because it takes longer to run a test

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
when you don't mock out your

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,639
dependencies

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
um but we've caught so many bugs this

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,440
way that

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,480
um you know i'm really happy we set it

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,279
up this way from the very beginning

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,680
okay and um you know we have lots of old

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,199
cranky people in the chat and in drupal

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,040
myself included there's an easy way to

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,360
opt out of this proposal

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
um if you use recommended project your

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
next command can be

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,759
compose or remove drush rush and now

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,000
you're right back where you started

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,560
um so you know i really see

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,560
not many downsides uh to the proposal

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,120
and i see lots of upsides

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,839
um i'm really curious to um hear what

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,000
you guys have to say

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,160
um so let's just uh open this up to

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
um anyone who wants to talk you can

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,240
request um

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
to be part of the voice presentation or

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,679
you can um

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:22,880
go ahead and ask questions in chat

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,919
okay we're going to hear from zhao

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,520
is that how i pronounce it yeah

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:33,039
one question what would be the original

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,120
objective here just drupal 9 and rush 10

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,840
or also drupal 8.

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,520
okay so that's a good question i was

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,640
contemplating that

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,520
um so

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
so recommended project is literally only

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,039
used once

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,160
in the lifetime of the site it's used to

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,160
launch the site

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
at the at its very first day it's like a

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,120
birthing tool

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,200
um so in my mind new sites are being

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
birthed on drupal 9 right now

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,960
very few of them are being birthed as

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,280
drupal 8 so it's not a priority for me

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,480
to add it to recommend a project for

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,880
drupal 8.

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,559
um if people want to um

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,160
if people want to discuss adding it to

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,919
the recommended project for eight we can

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,799
talk about it but you know at first

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
glance it's not

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,679
not a big priority

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,520
okay thanks you're welcome

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
jd

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,960
sorry i was unmuted uh long time

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,559
listener first time caller

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,480
uh big question that

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
i think made one of the security

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,160
concerns that people are bringing up

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,240
would there be any consideration to add

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,360
uh inability to drush to be able to

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,160
turn off or turn on various features

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
based on

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,200
environment say you know on a remote

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,160
environment on prod make sure nobody can

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,280
run db drop

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
yeah so the we have a mechanism for that

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,960
now

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,240
um it's called policy command files

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,400
i don't know if you're familiar with

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,880
them no i'm not but i'm

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
thrilled to hear about it yeah so if you

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
google

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,760
drush policy command files you'll find a

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,760
few examples

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,640
uh there's one in drupal dash project

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,120
um and it shows you how to prevent sql

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
sync

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,320
into production um and are syncing

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
over your whole files directory and

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,160
stuff like that so

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,640
um definitely took a look at that we can

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,760
talk about additional ways to

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,039
um prevent mistakes but i think that one

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,039
has served us pretty well for the last

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,520
few years

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,960
okay great thank you yeah the drum set

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,240
also caught my eye i have to say

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,240
you know during quarantine i wanted to

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
learn a new skill and so i went all out

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
on it

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,240
oh wow that's awesome were you a

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,520
musician before quarantine

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,559
uh yeah mostly wind instruments guitar

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,559
uh but you know i i figured beating on

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,679
something for a few minutes a day

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,520
probably would help

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,200
get rid of some stress yeah thanks for

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,720
noticing awesome

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
thank you um okay i see a few more

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
people

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
are wanting to talk which is great i'm

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,840
going to add all of you

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,080
uh go ahead chris

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,760
hey mitch um can you hear me okay

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,760
you're a little soft but i can i can

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,200
hear you

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,600
just keep going i'll talk cloud yeah so

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
um given like all the responsibilities

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
that you kind of outlined

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,120
that you have today um do you think this

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,159
proposal

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,559
to uh do like more release coordination

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
would

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,840
increase the overall responsibilities on

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
you or decrease

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,440
um i don't really see it

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,799
increasing um you know we've

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,039
successfully

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,440
coordinated with drupal core for a long

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,400
time now

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,720
and if we have to make new releases

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,679
at you know every six months or

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
something like that

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,159
uh we will i i don't i'm not

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,840
concerned about it um if you look at the

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
list of maintainers for drush it's

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,679
fairly long already

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,840
um and so other people are welcome to

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,480
step in and make releases if i

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
um become unable to do so for whatever

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,840
reason

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
and i welcome increasing that list if

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,080
anyone here wants to

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,000
get more involved with rush um all you

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,080
have to do is submit a few pr's

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
and usually you'll have me knocking on

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
your door asking if you want to maintain

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,080
something so

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
um yeah i i think there's enough people

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
that carry the load

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,320
and um and it doesn't it doesn't feel

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,320
burdensome to me

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,000
yeah that was kind of the

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,960
characterization i was looking for is

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
like this isn't

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
this isn't increasing really what you

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,039
guys are already doing

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,679
today no

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,799
i don't think so but it's acknowledging

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,559
that

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,559
there's a little bit of increased

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,480
coordination and

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,640
um the core maintainers could be

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
concerned about that i think that

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,400
you know one of the hard things about

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,799
being a core maintainer is that

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
you now have all of these children that

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
you barely control

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,760
that you depend on and need to

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,720
coordinate with and

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,480
i just want to commit to being not a

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,320
problem child but a

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
you know teacher's pet kind of child

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
um lucas

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,880
hey there uh this is lucas heading um

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,520
i maintain some of my great system and

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,679
core

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
uh there's been a couple requests over

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
the years for

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,200
putting things into dresh core

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,039
for my great support do you think that

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
putting this into recommended would sort

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,640
of

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,360
uh perhaps encourage that

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,720
or reduce that sort you know additional

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,320
requests kind of like

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,880
that yeah um i think that uh

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
that some form of migrate runner in

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
drush

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,559
makes sense um i

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,880
you know last project i used i used the

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,880
migrate run module

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
um so people might want to check that

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
one out and thought it was great

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,840
so that you know that's my current idea

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,559
for what a runner

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,960
in drushcore could look like um but it's

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,799
also

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
not like a done deal kind of

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,080
conversation so

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
you know lucas and the other migrate

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,960
maintainers

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,120
would be you know very valuable input

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
on what belongs in there so um let's

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,320
keep that conversation going

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,799
so after asking jen i had

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,240
like this brainstorm which is what

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,200
happens when you start talking

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,240
uh what if it wasn't actually in dresh

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,919
core but in

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,880
drupal core itself how much

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
like workflow other type core modules

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
where we might want to add drush

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,039
commands

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,960
how much of that would it sort of open

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
the door to providing

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,960
things that we've never really thought

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,919
of like it'd be an officially supported

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,799
way to do

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,840
brush things while also working with

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,640
core

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200
yeah i mean i think that's totally fair

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
game

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,640
um and it would work

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,480
out of the box um drush commands in

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,080
modules that core

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,200
um ships with it's really

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,440
a matter of getting um the community

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
and the core maintainers to sign off on

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,400
it so

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,520
um i encourage you to take whatever path

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,440
you want on that um

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,200
i i could see arguments for putting it

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,240
inside core and not in

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,760
or into dress core um or into another

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,360
composer package like there's lots of

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,840
different options

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,840
there um but yeah i'd be supportive of

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
that

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,760
um rodrigo

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
i wanted to ask if you can explain a bit

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,679
more how it's gonna be the process

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,240
like you're gonna talk with the car

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,520
maintainers is there gonna be an issue

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,200
in the isoqueue and when that happens

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,640
you wanna deprecate those

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,679
three core commands

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,400
uh okay so i think that you know

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,840
people can um correct me if i'm off but

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
i think that

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,360
um we're gonna need to open up a pull

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,919
request into the recommend dash project

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,679
um we're gonna need to open up an issue

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
in the core issue queue for discussion

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:09,200
and as far as the existing commands

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:13,200
you know i have no particular

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:17,600
uh flaming passion for changing them um

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,080
so ah all right ryan says no pr's

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,200
so that's fine um we'll just do the uh

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,360
core issue

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,720
and i guess once it's approved somebody

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,400
will make the

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,799
the git commit on recommended project

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,159
or make the git commit somewhere he can

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,080
tell me where

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,200
where the right place is maybe it's the

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,120
code that does

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,240
the subtree split um

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,000
and uh you know i i guess we'll see

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,919
as to whether any of those commands go

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
away or not i think you know that db

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,200
dump command

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,720
probably stays because it's about the

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,360
testing system

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
um server command seems like it doesn't

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,960
have to stay

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,960
but um i'd like to know a little more

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,279
about how people are using those like

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,880
maybe they're useful in the context of

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,440
uh

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,840
core mentoring or something like that so

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
um

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,559
okay so chris you you jump

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,480
in to say the purple core might need a

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,200
dress dependency

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
um yeah that's not something i'm

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,640
advocating for

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,399
but i also would not be opposed to that

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
um but you guys can discuss that amongst

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,200
yourselves

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,960
okay so um next one's casey

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,720
hi maj in my world i

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,880
create content types all the time and i

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,240
modify them all the time and

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,120
the only thing i've ever

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,000
found myself in need of a drupal console

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
for

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,039
is the business of exporting especially

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,520
in the eight world

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,120
exporting all the bits and pieces of a

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,240
content type

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,640
but without it i would have simply

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,600
exported everything and then use git to

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
pick and hunt for the various yml files

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
um

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,640
if i didn't have drupal console how

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,640
would i do that with rush

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,399
um so there's two

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,520
uh in general yes you export

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,559
um everything and then and get you take

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,000
what you need

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,760
um so

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
i'm not quite sure yes there's the

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,960
features module for

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,520
partial exports uh chris i'm sure will

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
bring up

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,080
uh his uh content hub thing which does

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,840
something similar

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,360
for exporting um and

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,919
um if console has

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,760
a feature that people love and makes

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,480
sense to put into drush let's just do

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,960
that

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
you know so i think there's lots of ways

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,080
to

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,279
service that need okay it's the uh

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,559
just for the sake of uh memory it's the

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,520
drupal cect command

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,559
and it seems to recognize all the bits

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,320
and pieces

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,640
that are relevant to this content type

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,720
and export it all in the same folder

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
and make my life easier it becomes a

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,679
little bit confusing when you have like

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,780
media related fields and such and then

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,159
uh

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,480
[Music]

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,240
all of that but i take your point and

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,559
i'll add it to the queue

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
and we can work on ricardo thank you

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,720
yeah thank you

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,720
randy

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,360
so uh you dealt with this a little bit

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,480
already but

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,200
i mean obviously this change should have

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,440
happened 10 or 15 years ago

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,840
and i know i mean you've dealt

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
and and it moved away from drupal

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,360
because of the release coordination

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,399
issues because drush was not

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,360
uh drupal release specific and you got

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,360
frustrated with that

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,039
so it's been moving the other direction

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
now it

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,559
very rightly needs to move back

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,760
toward drupal and toward coordination

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,360
with drupal

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,559
the the the thing is

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,480
there's long-standing

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,480
there's long-standing people issues that

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
prevented this from happening 15 or 20

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,039
years ago

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,399
um maybe um

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,840
can we solve those or those those

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,799
um what prejudices or whatever they

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,520
might be

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,480
are those solvable or is this just a

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,440
technical release management

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,440
integration problem

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,840
i mean it's a good point like as usual

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,000
that

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,279
it's easy with the technology the people

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,720
are the problem

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:54,080
um i i haven't read the back scroll here

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,320
i don't know how much um

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,399
support and how much fury has been going

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,720
on um

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,159
but if if people are a little grumpy in

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,840
the chat here i bet

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,240
we'll get the same grump in the issue

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,519
queue and so i i don't really know to

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,880
answer your question

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,360
um how much

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
resistance there would be to this i i

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,480
think that

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,480
it's possible there will be a lot less

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,200
resistance

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,320
because console isn't as big a thing

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
anymore

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,240
because we're no longer proposing to put

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,519
the command line tool into drupal core

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
um so i think that a lot of the real

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,519
sticking

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,360
points are gone um and

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,320
you know i am hopeful that there is

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:46,720
going to be some success

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:49,200
this time

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
i can say just the same for those that

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,760
haven't tried it yet

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
um you can't actually use uh console

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,679
will

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,279
with drupal 9 anymore there's different

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,399
versions of symphony being

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,240
being used so console if you're going

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,799
for drupal 9 console is not even an

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,399
option

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,600
uh it's not there

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,519
it does okay or 888 either

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,279
so oh really all right so um that's good

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,039
that's good input and i think that

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,760
that'll help

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,200
um i s you know along the lines of the

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,320
people thing

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,360
um this only works if people are

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,640
vocally in support um

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,399
we really need people to not like

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,720
sit there and watch the issue and see

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,840
what happens like you have to jump in

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,960
and say i support this

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,240
and um i you know whatever

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,159
and help argue for it um because

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,440
the status quo is very powerful

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,880
um and uh

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,399
you know this is a change to the status

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,399
quo so it needs vocal supporters

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,240
um no i have not created an issue for

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
this yet

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,519
um i kind of wanted to see how this

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,640
session would go

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,720
and um and

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
you know we we probably should talk

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
about that i think that we probably want

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,320
to

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,080
start a new issue and not go into this

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,440
command line and core

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,039
issue that um that doug posted in today

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,039
um so uh with that let's hear from doug

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,640
green

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,480
i actually supported the command line

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,600
and core issue more than this

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,159
it seems like that is the model that we

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,120
do something that can trip and then we

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,000
move the key

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,440
parts of it the api-ish parts of it into

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
core

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,159
and then do other things and contrib

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
that rely

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,240
you're proposing just keeping trust

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
almost completely separate at a core

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,640
other than this

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,200
dependency why not move the engine

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
into core

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,440
um because it's really big

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
and the core process would take years to

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,119
get something that big in

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,919
um because we have 10 years working in

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,960
this model

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,960
uh successfully

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,879
and there is actually very little

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
benefit now i think the model you're

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,159
describing made more sense

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,280
before composer um but now

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,599
we're all getting comfortable with our

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,240
application has many dependencies

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,119
and the just throw it into drupal slash

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,919
core

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,320
doesn't make sense like why didn't we

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,560
take

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,320
http kernel and take the best parts and

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,240
put it into core

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,839
or php unit um

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,839
i think the same thing holds for drush

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,160
i'm wondering it you know i'm processing

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,960
this and wondering if

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:06,240
maybe uh rush has several projects

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,440
and there's the drush core that you know

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,680
gets integrated in

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,839
drush core commands that get integrated

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,400
but then there are more optional things

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,440
that aren't necessarily always there

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,960
yeah and drush has um

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,760
been factoring out parts of the

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,040
application into other projects so

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,320
that is a way forward um in my mind

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,359
that's like a

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,480
multiple year plan um

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,800
and all in those multiple years

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,680
we have shitty out of the box experience

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,640
we have

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,320
schizophrenic documentation we have

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,760
people who can't check their php

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,680
dependencies because they don't

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,440
have rush in their project and so forth

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,400
so um

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,520
i just think that we can move faster and

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,560
better

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,560
with this proposal

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,240
so i have a question here

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,119
um let's go to jason and then ryan

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,320
because i don't think you guys have had

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,359
a chance to speak and

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,079
and then we'll go around again okay

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,040
great

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,960
so i'm really curious about here is um

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,880
sort of one triple console has stalled

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,160
as a project and

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,040
not just that um you know if there's a

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,760
way that

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,960
whatever sort of commands that have been

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,599
that were useful in there

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,119
to like how could that be triage that

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,680
brought it to

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,440
into drush or if some council could be

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,800
used as a good substitute

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,680
um the big thing is and what's really

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,560
been useful for our team is that we're

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,560
new

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
new people in new jersey who haven't

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,880
worked with people before

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,200
and possibly haven't even worked with

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
php or anything modern

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,560
symphony or capoeira phase before so a

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,000
lot of that scaffolding a lot of that

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,920
generate

00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,800
commands have been useful to help um

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,400
you know bootstrap in and accelerate

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,280
feature development

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,320
and so i'm a little concerned right yeah

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,040
the

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,200
yeah console was uh pretty innovative

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,320
with that scaffolding stuff

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,200
um and drush added the same sort of

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,599
functionality

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
with the generate command so if you run

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,359
just

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,640
rush generate you will see lots and lots

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,839
of things that rush knows how to

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,200
generate now

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,880
um so uh you know i think we have some

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,960
pretty good parity there

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,920
i'm sure some people are familiar with

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,520
discrepancies

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,839
we you know i'm happy to close those

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,480
discrepancies but i think we have a good

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
gen

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
scaffolding tool now oh so so

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,760
essentially it's a big reason why like

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
drush has kind of uh consumed a lot of

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,839
the

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,079
unique features of console

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,200
yeah i think you could say that

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,680
initially

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,880
console consumed rush and did the same

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,040
sort of thing

00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:02,640
and then and then yes dresh consumed

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,640
conclusions um right yeah ryan

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,599
i think my my main concern like i i'm

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,040
i support this idea i think it is you

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,839
make some really compelling arguments

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,359
for

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,119
um keeping it separate uh the main

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,880
difficulty that i'm curious about and i

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,720
kind of brought this up in the chat too

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,160
was just would you would the dress

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,040
maintainers be willing to coordinate

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,839
with core

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,520
and maintain the same cadence of

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,920
dependency support

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,520
such that if you know uh you know drupal

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,200
9 they're not going to drop support for

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,520
php3 for example until

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
nine is completely gone will you be able

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,720
to keep

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,839
drush at the same cadence with those

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,280
dependencies because like

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,720
that's the issue we have now is people

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,359
can't upgrade to drupal 9 if they need

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,520
console

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,200
because console didn't keep up with the

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,520
symphony dependencies

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,839
or also if josh wanted to drop support

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,920
for something before core was ready to

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,599
those sorts of things could be you know

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,800
um there could be challenges there so

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,760
i'm just curious how you how you

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,960
perceive that

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,000
going forward yeah um

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,680
i'm totally happy to coordinate

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,119
um in lockstep with drupal core um

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,119
so yeah that shouldn't be a barrier to

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,480
the proposal um

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,480
yeah happy to do that

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,680
and i think we have been doing that um i

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,599
think that uh

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,560
yeah you can still use drupal 7.0

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,119
something

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,119
with dresh um and so

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,760
cool yeah that's just my main concern is

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
that you know the symphony dependencies

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
and

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,760
all of the all of the overlapping things

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,040
where you both have the same

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,560
dependencies

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,359
they still have to be able to build a

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,720
site so

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,760
you know yeah i i think the

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,480
you know the details are tbd on that

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,240
like i don't know if if there's a

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,440
problem with drush going to

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,119
a major version before drupal does

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,640
i can't think of a reason why that would

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,720
be a problem but

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,960
um i know the core maintainers have lots

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,240
of experience with this so i'd want to

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,359
just

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,359
leverage that experience

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,000
all right happy to hear that happy to

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,599
hear that you're supportive

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,280
mixologic that's awesome yeah no

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,119
just a first class out of the box we

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,800
have a command line tool

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,480
and this is what you use and here's how

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,319
we use it versus

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,160
there's this thing you should use but

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,800
it's not really part of the product is

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,319
the

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,119
yeah it should always be part of the

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,680
product so yeah

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,680
cool um

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,800
just gonna say i created the issue

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,880
uh the url is just now in the chat

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
and i somebody should write a much

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,319
better issue summary

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,680
but everyone here that's interested in

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,680
that please follow the issue

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,720
informed thank you for creating that

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,800
um and uh

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,920
did mixologic say what's supposed to

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,200
happen

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,319
to actually get a uh change done to the

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,760
recommended project yeah i think it's

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,160
pretty straightforward he

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
he posted the file that needs changing

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,119
yeah so in core

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,680
it's it's the recommended project it's

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,680
in core so it's a subtree split

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,119
from core so it's the oh it's a composer

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,720
json that's in core

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,720
yeah yeah and it just gets subtree split

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,440
out into github to generate it so you

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,480
know

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,800
score and it gets made so it's you know

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,280
just

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,960
a patch filed against core which soon

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,640
we'll see uh some projects already have

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,000
merge requests enabled now

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,720
on drupal.org so we'll have merge

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,599
requests for core once everyone hammers

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
out the

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,960
this workflow's bad this workflow's

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,160
better um stuff

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,359
but so it might not even be a patch okay

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,040
well that'll be a great day yeah um okay

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,160
so thanks uh so yeah we have a core

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,000
issue awesome

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,079
yeah but uh i would say i wouldn't file

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,760
that against core

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
the idea i mean this for the whole

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,800
composer initiative

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,800
the ideas queue was like where

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,640
it kind of actually creates the whole um

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,000
the whole support from the the entire

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,680
core infrastructure of people

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,200
being like yes this is an idea we want

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,119
to do yes we support it yes

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,720
and then you know going from there i

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,400
think that's the best place for that

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,920
and then you know the product managers

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
the release managers and everybody else

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,400
will weigh in on it

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
and you know it'll be less of a

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
people shouting into a well and more of

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,920
the people who really need to pay

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,920
attention to it will

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,200
um okay that makes sense to me too all

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,200
right so we'll move that issue

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
any other thoughts

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,119
i'm curious uh mosh if you've run it by

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,520
dries or

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,640
or any of the other uh some of those

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,160
folks

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,839
you guys probably meet every day right

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,760
um yeah nobody meets with greece every

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,400
day

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,160
so uh i in earlier iteration of this

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,520
proposal i did run by

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,720
um alex pott and jess

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,760
um at uh drupalcon

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,119
europe the last one um in amsterdam

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,119
um i think that

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:40,319
it still wasn't quite this proposal um

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,240
and um there were some questions that

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,760
alex pott had that i think are resolved

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,440
by the proposal

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,160
um he was he you know he had reserved

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,640
um plus you know a plus one with

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,640
reservations when i talked to him before

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,319
um and i don't know if that's his

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,960
current position so you'd have to ask

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,319
him

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,640
um so i i don't know

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,920
how all of the the core maintainers are

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
going to feel about it i guess we'll

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,880
