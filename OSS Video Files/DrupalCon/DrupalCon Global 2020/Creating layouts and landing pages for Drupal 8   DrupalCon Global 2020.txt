all right

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,800
so so creating uh

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,880
today i'm going to be talking about

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
creating layouts and landing pages in

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,920
drupal

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,240
and i'm really going to plunge into the

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,760
layout builder versus paragraphs

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
debate today so that should be fun um

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
i know that's a question on top of mine

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
for a lot of people that i talked to

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,720
so hopefully this will be an interesting

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,960
topic for all of you here today

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
um just to introduce myself my name is

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
drupal agency

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,760
here in montreal i'm also on the board

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
of the drupal association i'm one of the

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
community elected members

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
and i love talking about content

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
strategy

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
i teach drupal and i love making it

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,640
easier to use

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
so if you're interested in any of those

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,879
things please come talk to me

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,160
i'm suzanne underscore kennedy on

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,120
twitter

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,559
and i'm pixelite on drupalslack and

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,559
drupal.org and everywhere

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,119
okay so the reason the reason

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
maybe you're you're here today is

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
because

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,439
you're uh you're you're into drupal

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,600
you're maybe a site builder you're a

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,920
themer you're a developer

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
that's who i tend to run into at

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
drupalcon's

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,759
um but the drupal content editor

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,680
experience is really important and we

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
heard this at the dries note

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,320
uh yesterday uh you'll hear this

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,479
more and more i think in the drupal

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
community the importance of

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,720
the content editor experience and making

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
those types of users really happy

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
especially when they're just getting out

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,720
started with using drupal

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
and for content editors you know there's

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
a lot of things we think of when we

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
think of drupal but i think

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
for content editors it's this content

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
creation experience that's really at the

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
heart of what

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,040
they think of when they think of

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
drupal and so it's important to think

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
about what

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
content editors want um and i was

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
actually

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
involved over the last couple years in

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
some ux research

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,480
of of drupal and thinking about this

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
question of what content editors want

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,000
and we actually went out and asked them

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,520
um and it's not surprising to know that

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
content editors want

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,959
like a an inter an interface that's more

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,519
designed for them

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,200
to go and create content and these days

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,920
what that content looks like has kind of

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,160
changed

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
so in the past when we thought about

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
content

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
we often thought about these pages of

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
content like

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you know a basic page an article an

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
event

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,599
um and nowadays when we think of content

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
uh the the types of pages that i think

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,680
content editors are trying to

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
create and trying to build look more

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
like this

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,680
they look more like what i would call

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,959
landing pages they look

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
more visual they look more like magazine

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
style pages

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
um and you're up you're probably

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
familiar with these

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,959
whatever your role is on on a project

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,879
and if we're a themer or a site builder

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
you know we could probably think of

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
five or ten ways in drupal of building

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
these types of pages

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
um but as a content editor it can be

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
kind of intimidating like oh

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,680
i i saw this other website it there's

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,200
this page that i really want to build

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,400
it looks like this and um

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
and and yet like how can i possibly do

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
that

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,599
in drupal so content editors want to be

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
able to easily create pages on the fly

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
that look

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
really visual that match the brand of

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,480
the website and that they can use to

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,920
build out their content strategy

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,480
um and often that means combining

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,319
um often that means combining different

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,439
types of content components on a single

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,159
page

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,080
and it's really hard to plan in advance

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
for all the future needs of pages like

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
this

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
it's not like it's not like building an

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
event content type where every field is

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
predefined

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
and that makes this problem really

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
difficult so

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
since the beginning of my time using

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
drupal we've been kind of looking for

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
uh the perfect solution of how to do

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
this i think my first ever talk at a

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
drupal

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
event was about using panels

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
and since then site designs have only

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
gotten more varied and more visual and

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
more

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
and more more and more complicated and

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
our expectations of what a content

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
editor should be able

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,120
to do has probably increased

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,479
um so the first thing i want to do today

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
now that we've kind of

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,160
talked about the the problem i i want to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
think about

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,880
um is i want to differentiate between

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,479
two really important things

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,400
page building and layout building and

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
of course drupal can do both these

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
things because drupal's amazing and can

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,000
do

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
all kinds of complex things um but these

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
are kind of different tasks

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
and the reason that it's important to

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,000
distinguish between them

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,520
is that you know you might pick

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
different tools depending on what kind

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
of task you're doing

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
and you might also expect content

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
editors to be able to do page building

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,199
but not layout building

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,639
uh so when i say layout building

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
and maybe that's a term that i'm

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
inventing i don't know

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
when i think about layout building i

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
think of what you're doing more as a

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,360
site builder or a themer

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,720
um when you're deciding okay for every

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,720
recipe on this website as an example

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
this is how the fields are gonna look so

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,360
i have a screenshot here with a pizza

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
picture a picture of a pizza on the left

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
hand side and all these other fields

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,479
about this recipe on the right hand side

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
and i would expect you know every recipe

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,280
on

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
my website is probably gonna look the

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,720
same i want to create this predictable

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,440
interface so this kind of page layout

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
work i think of as layout building and

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,960
this screenshot here is

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
setting this up doing the layout builder

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,240
but there are of course other ways to do

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,639
that in drupal as well

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
um then when i think about page building

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
i think about

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,919
more of a content editor task like a

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,120
content editor comes along

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,560
and they want to design the page the way

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,759
they have the

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
content kind of mapped out in their

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
heads so maybe they want to put

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,319
a banner at the top of the page and then

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,199
they want to add some marketing messages

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
and maybe maybe they decide that the

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
call to action the main

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,319
call to action goes at the very bottom

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
of the page because the user

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,160
has to consume all kinds of information

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,240
first

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
and so their ability to create a page

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
that's not just

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,160
a standard set of fields but a more of

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,039
visual page um where the content editor

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
is actually

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,680
selecting not just the content and the

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,120
fields that are input

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
but actually a little bit about the

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
content structure itself

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
so that's what i think of as page

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
building it's a little bit more advanced

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,800
than

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,599
content editing but it's not the same as

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,599
layout building

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440
so often when you're creating a drupal

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
site

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
um you know you're creating probably a

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,560
lot of structured content

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,039
most drupal sites we build are are

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
including a lot of content types that

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,199
are all following the same template

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
but probably part of the site that

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,599
you're building if you

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,319
have any kind of marketing

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
marketing requirements at all for the

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
website

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,720
you're probably designing a page

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,880
building tool

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,319
and i like thinking about this as

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,360
building a tool

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
and not building a set of pages or

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
building a set of

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,479
nice marketing landing pages um

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,960
and so all the questions that are going

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,520
to determine like what approach you take

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
it all depends on how flexible that tool

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
needs to

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
be who's going to use that tool and like

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,360
what kind of content do you have right

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
now

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
all those types of things so you want to

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
be asking the questions not just in

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,199
terms of what you need

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,919
the day that you launch but rather

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,360
what you need to build to enable good

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,360
content editing in the future

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,080
so i just want to walk through

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,919
a couple examples to kind of get us

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,120
thinking about this

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,880
and i like to kind of actually visualize

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,919
some use cases

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,120
so that's what we'll do to start and so

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,279
this first

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
example i'm going to try showing a video

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,839
i hope this i hope this works it's a

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
very short

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
little little video so it's just to show

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
you

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,279
kind of an example of scrolling down a

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
very simple landing page and i think of

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,920
this as a

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,880
simple page because um

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,279
there's not a lot of different types of

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,320
content pieces mixed together

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,800
uh it's basically one content component

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
after the next so when i'm doing this

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
kind of analysis i try

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
and avoid using the words block or

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,519
paragraph or

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,519
anything that has like a drupal

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,200
connotation so i like the word

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
like content component because it's

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
pretty general

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,680
um so if we just scroll down

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,760
a page like this and hopefully

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,600
this isn't too choppy we can see that

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
there's basically just one element

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,480
appearing after

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,839
the next um so we have kind of

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,959
three items that appear in in a

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,240
row at some point but that is more like

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,720
something that we could say is is a

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
an embedded view that appears as one of

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
our content components

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
so i'll just show again the page is

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
relatively simple we just have

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
one kind of call to action a call to

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,240
action

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
a view a call to action and then another

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,040
one and

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
and i find this just looking at it in

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
terms of design wise maybe there's

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,160
options around what each of those

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,680
components looks like

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,839
but i don't see a lot of layout required

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
to build a page like this

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
so in my analysis i'm going to be

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,839
thinking about kind of where everything

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
comes from

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
and what options are going to have to be

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
available and a page like this i kind of

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
think

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
of it as being kind of two-dimensional

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
so

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
the content editor when they're creating

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
the page

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
is going to be thinking about all the

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,839
different

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,959
components that make up the page so

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
those components

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,000
are the gray boxes and so

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
for those of you who maybe can't see

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,079
this or you're not looking at your

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
screen there's just

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,760
one gray box after the next and then the

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,120
yellow

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,519
elements are the actual content itself

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
and those might seem to have a layout

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,000
like you might have

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,360
three um three columns but that's more

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,519
of an internal logic

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,360
to the content so if i have three

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
news items in a row maybe it's because

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
that's just how that

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,079
view is configured it's configured to be

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
displayed as a grid

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,000
or if i have an image on the left and

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
text on the right maybe it's a single

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
call to action

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
and that's just how that call to action

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
appears

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,920
um that's just how that card is supposed

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
to be displayed

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,040
so when i'm thinking about the the types

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
of landing pages i need to build i would

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,399
i would be kind of mapping out what

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
types of options

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
have to be available and it's not really

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,480
enough just to look at one page

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
so in that example we just looked at say

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
the home page of the website and we're

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,040
thinking about

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,839
how how we would build this but ideally

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
when you're

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
doing an analysis you can think of you

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,839
know better to have

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
a whole set of landing pages that you'd

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
need to be able to build to know the

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,040
type of complexity that you would

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,000
that would be required okay so my next

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,600
example is a university website

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,600
um and this one is a little bit

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
a little bit more complex and what i see

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,120
sometimes on this page i see

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,680
um two elements next to each other like

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,040
an image and a list of links and these

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
are things that i think would have to be

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
kind of interchangeable

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,399
to build out these pages and in this

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,600
example i have two pages so it's a

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,360
little bit more

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
gives you a little bit better of an idea

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,240
and so basically this is just going to

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,440
show a banner at the top

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:36,959
um kind of a a grid of

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,680
news um some snippet of events

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,480
um there is also some social media

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,040
elements down at the bottom of the page

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,000
and we don't see a terrible amount of

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,240
layout going on

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
on this page either but the second page

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
if i look at it and i'm scrolling down

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,800
i do see more elements that are side by

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,959
side

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
[Music]

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,320
and so anytime when i see elements that

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
are side by side that are different

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,399
types that clearly are

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,480
are defined separately i know that my

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,600
content components are really living in

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,279
a layout

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,279
and so for this this type of design

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,360
i would see this more as being three

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
dimensional and i'm just making up these

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,760
dimensions right so

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,760
the dimensions are the gray boxes

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
which could kind of be like your the

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,360
sections of these pages

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,120
and they're just one after the other the

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,320
yellow boxes here

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,320
are going to be the the layout

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,480
so these provide that you know the fact

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,160
that does each section of my page have

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
one column or two column or three

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
columns um and then the purple boxes

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
here are the actual content

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,399
and so those also could have their own

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,519
logical structure or they could just be

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,680
um you know they could just be

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
a piece of content that just sits there

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
um

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,880
but a piece of content could also like

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,079
in the previous example

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,519
the set of new news items in three

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,320
columns

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,079
um so these these kind of determinations

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,839
can seem a little bit arbitrary but

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,480
really what you want to think about is

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,760
what is what is the content uh what is

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
the layout and what

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,199
what are the bigger structural

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
components of the page

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,320
and you want to kind of map that out

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,360
when you're deciding

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,279
what is required from

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,279
the design that you that you have

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,800
so that's kind of from a requirements

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
perspective analyzing how complex your

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
landing pages are i think that that's a

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,320
good

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,720
exercise to do next i'm going to focus a

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,120
little bit more on the content editor's

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,399
perspective

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,639
so this section of the presentation

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,160
comes from some usability testing

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,000
that i helped uh set up to compare

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
how people use the layout builder and

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
how they use paragraphs and some of you

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,839
might have seen

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
the the write-up that i did about this

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,199
and when i say

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
usability testing that we did my

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,839
colleague annika

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,680
is the ux designer and she actually

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
conducted all the usability testing

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,639
she's very patient and she watched

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,920
people

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,800
uh and to find the links that they

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
needed to find to use these tools

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,760
and so we observed uh content editors

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,959
using both tools

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
and we also tested

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,880
we also tested gutenberg i saw gutenberg

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
as

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,720
was mentioned in the comments just to

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,759
see what people thought of that

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,839
alternative tool um

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,040
so this usability testing the purpose

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
was to

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,160
compare how content editors constructed

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,959
a landing page a very simple landing

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
page

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,920
um definitely in the first category

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,120
and um we identified uh

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,320
the use case of really more page

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
building

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
we created a script and then we ran

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,240
through the exact same script

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
with each version of the website and we

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,720
configured the websites in advance

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
so we configured one website where users

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,759
were creating the content with

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,040
paragraphs and another website with um

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,880
with the layout builder

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
and we configured them in advance to

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,160
have these kind of building blocks these

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
content components that

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
users could work with um then we

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
recruited the participants and we ran

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
the tests

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
so we took videos and we made a lot of

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,320
um

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,839
a bit of a huge spreadsheet with all of

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
our findings and there is a write-up

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,560
that

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
you can also see with more information

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,279
but i'll just share kind of

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,839
the a summary so you can can see how

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,580
this

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,839
might influence your own decisions um

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,600
[Music]

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,680
so this is the landing page that we

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
asked users to create a relatively

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,120
simple

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,120
landing page it does have these elements

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,460
of content though that kind of live

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,399
um side by side so um

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,120
[Music]

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
so actually when i said before that this

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,160
was definitely version

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,039
definitely uh from the first use case uh

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
not necessarily the case so uh there

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,439
there are

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,679
there is actually a layout component to

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
these landing pages

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,000
although they're hello it's a very

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,839
simple page um

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,360
the first impression so i think it's

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,360
always interesting with usability

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,039
testing to ask users you know what are

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,880
your first impressions what do you what

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,439
do you think of this page

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,480
um and i think when we presented the

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,160
layout builder

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,799
as a as a way of creating this landing

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,799
page

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,000
users were a little bit unsure first

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,080
about where to go

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
and the reason that they were unsure is

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,240
because content editors are looking for

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
terminology that they're familiar with

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
about creating content

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,679
and when users come to this page they

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,799
don't see any

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,640
um create content link like you would

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
if you go to the content section of a

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,039
drupal website

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,880
uh and so it can just be confusing uh

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,320
the general terminology block

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,840
section these terms are not

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,840
super evident um but that being said

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,280
once they were able to find the create

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
custom block

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,200
uh link there which is how they would go

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
about adding

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
the custom adding the content components

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,840
to the page

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,880
everyone was able to figure out how to

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
to build the page

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,080
and everyone really loves the the drag

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,200
and drop

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,120
type of interface so that question of

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,520
where do i create content

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,240
uh that came up uh again and again and i

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
think

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,960
um what what we found kind of in

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
follow-up work

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,640
with some content editors is that uh

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
applying some of the modules to improve

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
the ux

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,559
of the layout builder uh really helped

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
with this

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,039
very subtle changes to this interface

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
made a big difference for content

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,520
editors

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,000
um so in terms of adding blocks just the

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
idea of adding blocks is a little bit

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
confusing and most of that confusion

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,799
comes from the fact that

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
by default when you're using the layout

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,440
builder there are just many many blocks

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,240
available

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
so using the layout builder restrictions

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,160
module

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,559
to limit the options here and just

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,320
basically remove everything except the

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,000
create custom block link

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,799
um that that makes a huge difference to

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,320
the usability and basically makes it

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,280
possible for

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,200
for uh users to use this for page

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
building

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
um and then when editing custom blocks

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,520
there was also the challenge

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
of just the terminology so this word

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,039
configure over here

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
configure is such a site building word

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,799
and it's really not

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,640
um something that content editors are

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,760
used to seeing in drupal

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
because they don't usually have

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,720
permission to configure things uh

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,880
so just um if if you are going to

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
roll out this tool with content editors

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
then it's important to have that

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
kind of training for them documentation

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
for them so they know that that's

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,200
the right thing to click on

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,520
and then comparing this to paragraphs so

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,919
paragraphs if you look at the ui

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
it's much more similar to a standard

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
content editing

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
interface in drupal so when we're using

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,600
uh

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,320
paragraphs to manage a page like this

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,400
you know it's a form in drupal that like

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,240
an edit form for editing content

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,960
and with paragraphs the form becomes

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,320
much longer um but it's still just a

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,320
like a node edit page that they're using

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
um so we found that the content editors

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,000
we tested with

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,679
were definitely able to use paragraphs

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,039
very well they found this actually a

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,240
simpler approach

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,799
up until the point of using the

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,559
using paragraphs to add any kind of

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,640
layout information

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
so some of you who have built sites with

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
paragraphs might have taken this

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
approach before

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
of using paragraphs to actually manage a

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,400
layout

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
and having a paragraph type perhaps

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
called two columns

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,039
um and so content editors found this

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,400
very confusing

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,480
and were unclear as to what that meant

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,799
and um just the fact that the visual

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,960
display of the layout wasn't being

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,320
displayed to them in the form

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,240
was a real hang up for them um

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
so there were definitely some drawbacks

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,039
to this approach

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,039
but the fact of the matter is that when

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
you're using paragraphs to construct a

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,480
page

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
there are a lot fewer clicks and for

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,880
anyone already familiar with

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
the interface it is going to seem more

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,200
familiar and

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,720
easier to use um so there there were

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
some kind of trade-offs there

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,480
and then when we pulled in gutenberg so

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,520
we tested this because we thought it

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,640
would be

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,520
it would be fun to just know how

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
uh these two drupal tools compared to

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,159
the

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
the wordpress kind of experience so we

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
tested

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
um how content editors would create the

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,600
exact same page

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,400
using wordpress with gutenberg editing

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,159
turned on and we found that at first

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,919
users really liked the interface so the

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,720
first impression data was all really

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
good

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,159
um and they liked also how their landing

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,080
page looked in the

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,559
editing experience um but the preview of

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,039
what

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,120
the editors saw didn't really relate to

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
the landing page that resulted in the

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,840
front end

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,000
so there was definitely a disconnect

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,200
there and the most interesting thing

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,840
that i found from the editing experience

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
is the fact that although the tool looks

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
really simple

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,400
because you have this in-place editing

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
experience

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,919
that interface that simplicity

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,240
really hides a lot of the complexity or

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,960
hides a lot of the

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,559
the options that you might need to edit

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,720
content components

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,880
and so it's fine if you're creating the

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
most simple kind of content components

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,640
but as soon as you want to change any of

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
those options it becomes

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,200
harder to use so that

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,799
kind of is an interesting finding and

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
another interesting thing was that the

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,840
editors themselves actually pointed to

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,240
the fact that

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,080
they are willing to use a more complex

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,679
tool if it means that they get more

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,720
flexibility

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,440
and so they as much as they might like

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,400
the idea of a simple tool they're

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,400
willing to learn

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,799
something new so kind of a

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,080
um an interesting finding and good

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,280
takeaways for us

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,360
uh if we're feeling like layout builder

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,280
is just such a complex tool for content

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,480
editors maybe it's worth

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
worth it uh if if that's what's required

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
so some takeaways from all of this

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,120
usability testing

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,159
um before i draw any conclusions um

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,640
just some general takeaways so when

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
you're building a tool for page building

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
you want to think about the content

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
editor workflow so it might not be

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,000
exactly the same as what we think of

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,919
as site builders so

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,919
when a content editor goes to create the

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,000
page they might not create

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,159
start thinking of it in drupal terms

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
first they might think first in terms of

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,520
what they want to communicate they might

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,559
draw out different

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
uh content components and then figure

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,000
out

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,000
the the work of the flow of content that

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,600
they want to appear on the page

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,400
and then they might fill in kind of more

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
of these options about

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,039
styling what goes on the left and what

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,120
goes on the right afterwards

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,480
and so that kind of content editing

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
process it's worth

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
while thinking about it thinking about

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,760
it from the content editor

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,559
perspective and and what might be best

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,240
for them

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,640
and also to think about that when you're

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,360
writing documentation

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,880
um editors really like a layout oriented

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
editing experience

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,440
but they don't necessarily want

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,320
limitless options so in my experience

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,559
if you give editors kind of a color

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,320
wheel when you're asking them like what

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,679
what color do you want this heading to

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
be um

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,279
that's that's not a great experience

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,400
because they're gonna

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,919
be um they're gonna be

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,600
not sure what to do like deer in the

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,440
headlights like what option do i pick

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,960
there's too many options

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,039
and they don't want to be saddled with

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
the responsibility of

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,559
making the website accessible right so

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,919
you don't want to

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,919
give them unlimited options

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
and that goes for things like the number

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,440
of layouts they can pick from

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,880
or the number of content components that

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,039
they have

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
um the layout builder is complex because

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,559
it's more flexible so when we did the

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
testing a lot of the participants

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,880
recognized that

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,039
and they they verbalized it even and the

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,080
um paragraphs is similar to standard

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,080
content editing

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,520
experience so even though it creates a

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,600
more complex form

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,360
it's still a form that's familiar if

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,720
you're working with content editors who

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,720
already have drupal experience

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,320
and then in terms of how we can take all

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,000
this and

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
decide how to customize the page

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
building experience for content editors

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,960
there's some really specific things that

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,880
we can do so whether you decide to use

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,159
one tool or another you just don't want

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,919
to include too many

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,960
content component types whether you're

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,799
using blocks or paragraphs to do that

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
it's really useful to use things like

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,200
entity or views reference fields

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,720
to have content editors avoid

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,559
duplicating content

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,039
and they will appreciate those those

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,799
types of tools

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,080
to limit the options that you give

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,000
editors using

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,919
the layout builder there are some

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,840
modules uh the layout builder

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,600
restrictions module is great

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,120
and you can also try the layout builder

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,039
ux or layout builder

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
modal modules and there are plenty of

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,320
other modules

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
available that work with layout builder

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
so those are

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,440
important to use

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
the site building kind of oriented

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
terminology i think that that's

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,159
something that

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,279
um we can try and avoid so when you're

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
naming

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,360
things in drupal as you configure it you

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,240
can actually decide to name things that

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,279
are

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,520
more accessible more appealing to

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
content editors so that's something just

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
to think about

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,440
when you're doing that kind of

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,640
configuration

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,480
and that kind of labeling um and just a

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
final thing so content editors love the

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,039
media library they love

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
the idea of reusable media um and so

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,720
don't forget that when

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,600
you're creating these page building

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,600
tools

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,320
um because the more visual content you

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,000
create of course the more media you need

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,440
to fill in all

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
here we get to the part of the

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,320
presentation where i try and

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,600
answer this question for you so what

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,080
kind of um what kind of decision

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,279
go go or what kind of criteria go into

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,600
this decision

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,039
of whether to use paragraphs or whether

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,440
to use layout builder

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,120
when designing this page building tool

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
that your website probably needs

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,080
so i broke this up into pros and cons so

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
whichever one you choose you should be

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
aware of

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,399
at least these pros and cons um

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,159
so in both cases paragraphs and layout

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,679
builder you can define

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,799
these types i find layout builder when

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,880
you're using it to build

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,480
landing pages the best way to use it is

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
to define

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,240
block types and then to make those

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,279
available so that

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,600
the the content editors can use them to

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
construct the page

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,120
same thing with paragraphs you're going

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,919
to be defining these paragraph types

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,480
that can be used to construct a page so

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,960
uh

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,720
and these options are really similar and

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
the way that they work is

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,760
is quite similar just in terms of the

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,200
content definition

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,840
with paragraphs creating these

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,480
actual content components in the ui does

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,799
have

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,240
fewer clicks if you kind of know ahead

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
the types that you're building so you

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,039
can

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
go and easily pick from the list the

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,760
drop down list

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,600
which type you want to create and add

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,000
that to the page

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,760
and it's similar to this normal content

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
editing experience

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,600
on the other hand with layout builder

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
even though it might be a little bit of

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,799
a learning curve

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,480
the content editors do love the fact

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,279
that they can drag and drop

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,880
content from one place to another and

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,679
not just drag and drop it up and down

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,039
the page

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,440
but in this additional dimension of the

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,120
exact column that it appears in that

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,360
layout aspect

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,960
that the layout builder gives us um and

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,399
so even if

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,080
um even if the layouts that they're

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,559
creating are simple

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
uh content editors love having access to

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,960
those tools and it makes them feel like

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,440
they have more control over the page um

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
and of course that leads to more

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,720
flexibility so the layout builder is of

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,360
course more flexible

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,159
and that could be a pro it could also be

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,799
nice

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
to to provide a less flexible experience

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,559
because you want your pages to look more

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,159
consistent

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,000
um and then the last thing that i would

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
say about the layout builder in terms of

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
positive things

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,039
um the layout builder it allows you to

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,640
use the same

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,240
approach the same all the same concepts

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
for page building as you would for

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,360
layout building

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,000
so i know what i said i wasn't going to

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,000
focus on layout building today

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
but if you're already using the layout

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
builder to define

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
what all of the recipes on your site

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
look like wouldn't it be nice if you

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
just could use the same tool for page

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,880
building

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,320
in terms of of negatives i think a lot

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,000
of these things

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,679
um well some of these things can be

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,919
addressed but um

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,799
on the paragraph side paragraphs is

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,640
simply not designed to manage layouts

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,240
and so the the the content editor is

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,159
expecting some kind of a

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,440
preview of what their page is going to

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,000
look like and they're just not going to

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,120
get that

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,120
with the paragraphs module

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,880
um it's hard to visualize the end

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,519
product as a result

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
um and then paragraphs itself even

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,320
though

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,120
it's widely used one of the most popular

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,080
modules is not part of drupal core

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,000
so you're relying on this contrib module

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,679
which is always something to consider

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,279
on the other hand layout builder is in

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,880
core which is great

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,080
um the the layout builder some negatives

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,120
about it um uh the

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,039
editing ui is kind of desktop centric so

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,039
when we think about building a layout

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,200
with three columns of course the three

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,080
columns are gonna appear

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,679
on the desktop but anyone viewing the

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,080
the same page on a

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
mobile device is gonna see this more

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,919
collapsed

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,360
layout so it feels like you're getting

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,360
this amazing preview

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,760
but that preview is only capturing one

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,399
you know one experience whereas a lot of

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
your

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,720
users are probably using other types of

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
devices

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
so i find that with paragraphs the fact

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
that you just have a big form

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
you know it doesn't show you what the

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,840
page is going to look like um

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,600
but it also doesn't lie to you about

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,840
what the page is going to look like

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,480
so so that that's kind of one thing to

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,519
keep in mind with layout builder

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,720
and in terms of the experience a lot of

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,000
the things i mentioned

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
about um over overwhelming number of

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,440
options

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,919
that can be mitigated um but one thing

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
that's hard to mitigate i think is this

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,039
fact that you have a separate tab for

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,159
editing

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,880
the page and changing the layout so

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,760
that's something just to make sure that

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
you

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,760
capture if you're rolling out the layout

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,039
builder and you have to train

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,720
your editors so for layout builder there

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,399
are lots of contrib modules like i

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,679
mentioned to improve the ux

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,559
so you want to make sure that you take

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,559
advantage of those

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,480
so i'll just mention some final

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,840
important details so whichever method

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,399
you pick

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,399
there are some big caveats to using

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,240
these types of page building tools in

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,919
general

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:11,120
so first of all accessibility and seo

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,640
are super important and one of the

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,399
strengths of drupal is that you have

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,440
structured content

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,000
and so building an accessible

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,519
and seo friendly website easier but when

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
you throw structured content

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
out the door you don't you know you

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,720
don't want to mess that up

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,760
so really your content components

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
themselves

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
are structured so that's that's good

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,279
your paragraph types and block types

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,200
so you want to make sure that the way

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,000
those are displayed and

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,720
the type of html they produce is going

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,120
to be

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,399
accessible and you also want to make

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,039
sure that your content is still

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
searchable

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,519
on your site and through google so that

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,559
means making sure you have all the right

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,559
metadata in place

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,840
and then finally everybody's favorite

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,200
topic

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,200
change management so this decision about

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,640
paragraphs versus layout builder i think

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,799
a lot of us would

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,840
you know go say let's use layout builder

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,919
it's the new tool

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,600
it's got lots of pros we really want to

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,480
use this our content editors are going

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,119
to love it

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,520
um but the change management factor is

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,200
real

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,119
so let's say um you know

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,960
a large number of sites that there are

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,879
already using paragraphs

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,040
and it's a big decision to make to

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,839
switch to a different tool

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,560
um there's not like this easy migration

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,599
path

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,200
um that that's available to you and when

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,520
we're talking about layout

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,200
you know what the layout uh like where a

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,359
block should be positioned

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,399
it's hard to capture that in a migration

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,879
script

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,200
even if you're writing one from scratch

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,280
uh so this is a big challenge

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,800
um retraining your content editors is

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,359
another challenge

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
and um not just that but actually the

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,320
developers working on the project

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,359
so these are things to keep in mind

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,400
and it's uh documentation is going to be

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,560
important documenting all those content

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,359
component types that you create

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,880
and so if you are switching from one

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
solution to another you're going to have

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,800
to recreate

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
that documentation so just keep all that

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,079
in mind

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,960
before you decide to take the plunge and

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
switch over to

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,560
to a new tool so i put together

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,640
a few resources here including the

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,640
usability testing results

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,359
a blog post version of this this talk

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,320
and some great videos that

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,880
um or a great video that's put together

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,599
to show the layout builder in action

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,599
uh as well as some links to modules and

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,920
there's some great documentation that i

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,920
found that georgia tech put together

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
for their layout builder implementation

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,599
and i think this is just a great example

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
of the type of documentation you might

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,000
need to build

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,839
so check that out as a as a really

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,839
valuable

00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
resource

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,000
and my team does drupal training

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,280
so if you're interested in using these

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,200
tools or just

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,359
learning drupal from the ground up if

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
you're onboarding your team

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,320
i just wanted to give a shout out to

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,240
these trainings we were meant to do some

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,560
training at drupalcon and that got

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,760
cancelled because of the online format

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,680
but we do have lots of

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,079
online trainings coming up that you can

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,079
check out

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,520
so i'm gonna hop over to the uh

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,000
chat to see what kind of questions have

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,040
been

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
popping up so now is a great time if you

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,839
have questions to go and add them

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,839
to the chat

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,040
all right so i'm gonna try and find

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,000
the the questions amid all the

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,280
discussion about

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,920
everything in the chat um

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
yeah the presentation will be available

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,440
on

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,680
uh online i think through the session

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,599
page

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,280
if you have custom blocks with layout

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,960
builder wouldn't you run into an issue

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
with content editors creating an

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,640
unsustainably large

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,720
custom block library so that's a that's

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,640
a great question um the blocks that you

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,160
create when you create these inline

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,320
blocks with layout builder

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,560
it's not the same as a block that you'd

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,119
create through the block layout page

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,680
so uh it's not it's not going to be the

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,800
same

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,160
category so that concern has been

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,079
uh mitigated um

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,599
to to some degree but as with anything

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,000
you know a large a large amount of

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,200
content is is something to manage for

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,200
sure

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,640
uh another question when building a page

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,960
with layout builder what is the best

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,359
approach to move this to stage

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,560
and production environment like is this

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,640
a manual thing

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,480
so actually the nice thing about layout

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,800
builder is that

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,599
um when you're creating these layouts

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,079
you know

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,839
that is a content change so it's going

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,880
to be a change that's made

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,599
in the uh in the database and here i'm

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,880
talking about

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,119
page building um and i see that as an

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,480
advantage because it means if a content

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,240
editor goes and

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,160
and builds one of these pages they don't

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,520
have to deploy it like you would

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,599
configuration whereas the

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,720
the layout building tools that layout

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,119
builder gives you

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,880
are configuration so that that's that's

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,839
the difference there

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,400
um as far as i understand it i'm not

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,920
sure

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,640
there might be a way to deploy

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,680
to deploy pages built with the layout

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,680
builder but i'm not sure

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,000
um a question uh both

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
options are both options compatible with

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,240
workflows and accessibility requirements

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,359
um so in terms of

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,160
workflows uh you

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,520
are you are gonna have perhaps more of a

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,599
challenge like you you can

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,800
certainly draft a page using layout

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,599
builder um

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,119
but when we imagine standard workflows

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,560
in drupal where you might want to see

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,560
the differences between

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,760
two versions of a page obviously that's

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,480
going to be more of a challenge with

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,880
layout builder

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,680
just because you have that layout change

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,040
as well

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,280
and in terms of accessibility

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,760
requirements it's really up to the

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,760
theme of the site to manage that so

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,000
that's definitely a challenge when you

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,560
i always just think of this example of

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,640
like if you make the entire page

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,400
managed with the layout builder or with

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
paragraphs it's the same problem

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,320
and you just say okay every single thing

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,839
on the page is is layout builder

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,440
or paragraphs um then

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,200
what if the first thing on the page has

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
to be an h1 right you want your title of

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,760
your page to be in each one

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,520
maybe you assume oh of course the the

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,520
content editor is going to add a banner

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,720
first that's my h1 that's at the top of

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,400
the page

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,160
but with the drag and drop tools they

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,359
can easily take that and drag it to the

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
bottom of the page

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,440
so you want to avoid that you want to

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,119
make sure that whatever is that

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,359
h1 at the top of the page you want to

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,079
make sure that that's always there and

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,119
that's

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,040
not a flexible thing that can

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,400
change um so then you know

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,400
likewise you'd want to make sure that

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,560
the content components you do build

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,800
have semantic markup that's the number

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,000
one thing for accessibility

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,240
and that for example they do have a

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,560
title that you know you start with an h2

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,359
to kind of inherit or go down to the

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,640
next level

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,319
after the h1 so

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,640
yeah you have to you have to think about

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,040
accessibility basically at every step

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
and i would recommend starting that in

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,240
the x

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,760
in the design process not waiting until

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,760
you're building the content components

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,359
um okay i'm gonna keep scrolling up any

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,839
suggestions for making sure that brand

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,680
standards are kept by content editors

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,960
okay that's a great question that first

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,040
example i showed you

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,119
of the site the little video scrolling

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,280
down

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,480
the first iteration of that design just

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,040
had

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,240
a set of here are all our brand colors

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,599
and i think there were

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,160
10 colors and so i came in

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,599
as the site site builder theme around

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,960
the project and i said no no we're not

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,160
going to do it that way

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,920
let's make sure that this site is

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,280
accessible so let's create a set of

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,040
color palettes

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,680
so it's definitely easier for the

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,240
content editors but also just

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,720
easier i think as a developer to figure

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,119
out

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,960
or to wrap your head around if there are

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,000
a more limited set of options

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,280
so we said okay a call to action can be

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,800
one of you know five color palettes

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,880
and those reflect the brand standards

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,200
and then it can have a few other

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,040
adjustments about the image position

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,440
and those were the options that we built

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,520
into those content components

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,880
and so each content component you have

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
to kind of think about the brand

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,359
standards

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,280
so these days that's often managed by

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,040
having some kind of a pattern library

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,040
pattern

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,880
a set of patterns that you use that

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,720
would probably

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,400
be closely related to the content

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,920
components that you give to content

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,839
editors

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,440
and you'd be doing your brand standards

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,440
review at that point

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,880
um all right let me just see if there's

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,880
time for maybe one or two more questions

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
um

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
some of you have great comments and then

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,640
you put a question mark at the end but i

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,119
think it's a comment

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,240
um are both options compatible oh that

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,160
one was asked again

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:13,839
great great uh duplicate question

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:13,839
um so i'll just maybe answer one more

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,720
so that one thing that came up um

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,440
earlier i think it was in the 3's q a

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,000
was a question of

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,040
all these tools like layout builder

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,640
paragraphs

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,960
and then what about a tool like cohesion

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,920
which is something that acquia started

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,520
to offer

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,280
as kind of another another solution for

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,640
page building

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,400
and that's a tool that kind of goes

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,640
beyond these two options

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,240
it provides the the level of like you

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,040
can choose what components go on the

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,760
page

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,280
it has the layout aspect but then it

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,640
also allows you to build

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,640
um kind of a library of styles

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,440
through the editor i mean or through the

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,280
um through the configuration experience

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,000
so you don't have to go into a drupal

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,720
theme to add more options for what these

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
components

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,319
look like so that kind of adds one

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,520
additional level

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,280
of complexity and

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,640
and i know as themers sometimes we feel

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,160
like oh i would like

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,400
to be able to edit everything in the

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,680
theme but if you've heard of this

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,839
this cohesion tool its goal is to give

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,760
all those kind of more visual options

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,760
also through the editing experience

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,400
so that's just to kind of add that so

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,119
thanks everyone for

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,119
attending today i hope this this helped

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,240
to kind of make this decision and helped

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,000
you think about

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,400
landing pages and layouts and drupal in

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,920
a new way uh if you have more questions

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,839
