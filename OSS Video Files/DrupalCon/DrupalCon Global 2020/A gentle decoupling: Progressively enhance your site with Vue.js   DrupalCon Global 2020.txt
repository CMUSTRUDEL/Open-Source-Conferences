and we'll just figure it out as we go uh

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,000
welcome inside no i can stop reading the

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,200
chat i'm going to describe myself

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,200
welcome to a gentle decoupling enhancing

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
your site with vue.js

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
accidentally reading my longer title

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
that did not get approved

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,880
in this session we're going to be

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,240
talking about how you can use vue.js as

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,760
opposed to something like

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,279
react or angular if you're an angular

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
person

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,719
to piecemeal decouple your site

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,000
from the bog standard php that

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,559
a lot of sites are still running on

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,960
my name is giuseppe giuseppe de

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,840
aristotle i'm a web application engineer

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,879
at

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
nbc sports specifically with a golf

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
channel

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,399
it's where most of my responsibilities

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,280
have been recently

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
with me is eric you want to introduce

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
yourself

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,239
you're just going to keep working yeah

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,560
how are you doing everybody uh my name

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,640
is eric ryer i work

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
alongside giuseppe and some other

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,360
talented devs

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,200
um previously officially at golf panel

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
we've recently been moved over

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,479
a little bit more to the nbc sports side

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,040
which is

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,479
uh the company that we were on the air

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
under the umbrella of and now work

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,280
full-time for

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,280
um but yeah that's um that's who i am i

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
have a lot of experience in drupal

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
i've been working with it since about

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
2012 or so

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,799
and uh i fit in perfectly at nbc because

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
a lot of our properties are built on

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
drupal so

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
uh it's been a good fit for me so far

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,520
and i'm sure giuseppe feels the same way

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,040
um yeah that's it

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
great so i'll i'll take us to the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,759
beginning part here just so that

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
eric doesn't have to worry about it and

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,719
kind of keep going on to his

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,200
uh work so oh we had introductions here

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,479
and i

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,640
skipped the uh skipped the slide

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,159
uh that's fine for our beginning i just

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,720
want to talk about

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479
sort of the origin of how we settled on

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,680
this exact process

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
and um we don't need slides to follow

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,080
along with that

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,000
um in 2018

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
we at golf channel decided to switch our

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,599
site over to drupal 8 from a

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
very long suffering drupal 6

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,040
and 7 installation we had different

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
parts of the site running on different

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,000
servers that were running

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,599
different versions of drupal even so we

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
had some pretty clear

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,640
goals in getting the site unified

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
under one umbrella under drupal 8.

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,760
the dictates from on high were to keep

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
it drupal keep it simple

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,519
get it done fast and for ninety percent

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
of the site that worked

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
pretty well uh articles

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,480
you know blog posts galleries all that

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,000
works

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,640
just fine with a smattering of

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,879
javascript and your standard php

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,480
but when we got to scoring which is

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,680
a beast of a topic

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,599
we quickly ran into some walls the

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,640
drupal 7 version of our scoring site

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
needed full page refreshes

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
every time you wanted to update the

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
scores and we knew that that was not

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,959
going to work

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
it's just it's bad juju but we also

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
didn't want to do anything

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,080
with a ton of jquery or something just

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,040
to get ajax page refreshes

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,040
and we knew that we would need a lot of

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
not only live updating but dynamically

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,360
loading

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,680
widgets for score cards or betting odds

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,879
or tea times and all of us on our team

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
sort of sat down and branched out jammed

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,080
on different things one person took a

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
react approach one person tried to do it

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,040
just in

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,159
um and i went hey let's do view

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,640
because i love vue a lot

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
unabashedly i'm sorry for the react

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
people in the audience i know there are

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,680
at least a few of you but i am

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,199
not a react guy just don't gel with it

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
react is awesome but for our use case i

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,120
thought the

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
thank you stewart for our use case i

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
thought the strongest argument for vue

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
was the fact that it's

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
super easy to just drop into a site or

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
onto a page

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,840
just in its own little block

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,919
so what we ended up with was an entire

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,320
single page application

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
with five or six tabs depending on where

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
you are

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
with localization support for some of

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,280
our partners in

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,240
europe all running in a block

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
on a drupal page

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,880
and when we realized that worked and we

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
were shocked and surprised that we

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,039
got it out on time we started looking

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,039
all across our site and realized that we

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,880
could apply that same logic

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,639
to everything our menus

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
menu crawlers and twig are kind of a

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,840
pain if we could avoid that and go into

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,880
or an interview we would search

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,000
yeah we want live search to work and

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,919
that's historically been a bit annoying

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
so let's make that view all of our

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,759
various partner news feeds

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,759
json feeds great cool awesome

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
so after having

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
ripped apart probably 60 of the site at

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
this point and put

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
new blocks and regions in place that are

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
entirely driven by view

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
living inside the drupal environment we

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,840
decided we could

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,479
share some of our knowledge with you um

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,560
i'm trying to just see based on eric's

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,960
face whether or not he's uh

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,600
ready to jump in because the example we

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,360
really wanted to walk you guys through

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,120
um is one that's a lot more universal

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,479
than scoring it's

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,479
search um and then

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,240
we'll go on to something very very

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,080
simple which is how you can

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,880
replace a menu with view

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,880
like today

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
next for an end all right so eric are

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
you uh

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,199
yeah are you good yeah i should be able

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
to jump in right now and just kind of go

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
over

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,759
um the search side of of

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
what we worked on with golf channels so

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
at the beginning of this year

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,360
we got a bunch of requirements that

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,440
require that

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,280
made us have to build a search page

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,280
on golf channel utilizing elasticsearch

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,520
um from scratch so everything

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
we got a clean slate we had to bring in

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,280
elasticsearch we had previously built it

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,639
in solar but we kind of shifted away

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,759
from that

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,440
for various reasons but

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,280
the requirement was let's build a

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,199
completely custom search and kind of

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,639
throw out kind of this third-party

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
service that we've been using

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,960
for search previously so uh that's kind

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
of the start of the whole thing

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
so um kind of to to begin the whole

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,319
thing if you go to the next slide

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,400
giuseppe

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,919
um the idea was

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,199
we had to architecture the

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,720
uh yeah so we had to

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,240
are you controlling the slideshow to

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,400
sepi or is that

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,080
yeah okay uh yes okay so

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,479
um we had so many requirements at the

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400
beginning it it kind of felt daunting

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,479
you know there was there was almost too

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,039
much for us to handle but

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,639
because of folks like giuseppe and a

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
couple other people on the team who were

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
really

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,680
really strong at site architecture we

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
were able to

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,759
identify vue as right

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,160
uh the right library to use to help us

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,599
componentize most of the site

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,240
um so with the help of giuseppe

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,520
he was able to kind of guide us in

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,120
structuring

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,199
um between various modules and drupal so

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
that we could build out search without

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
having very much overhead at all you

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
know view kind of allows for that but

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,440
um you know giuseppe really set it up

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,360
for us and and made it easy

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
so uh go on to the next slide just abby

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,000
absolutely i'm just kind of hitting the

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,599
chat while you

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
while you talk yeah no worries no

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,279
worries okay if i look distracted um

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
giving you kind of a basic overview um

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,080
of how

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
giuseppe architectured this in the

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
beginning we had

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,680
various modules but with this example

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,839
we'll just look at a couple of them so

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
we had a global module which handles a

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
lot of

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,320
our global view components whether it be

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
a teaser

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
or some other block here and another

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
block there that type of stuff so

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
we have this global module that handled

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
a lot of

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
components that we wanted to kind of

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
sprinkle throughout the site

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
now for search that was valuable because

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
we needed just to be able to

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
plug in a teaser component when we

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,000
brought back search results

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,360
so each search result would have a

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
various teaser

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
um so that was the first step is just to

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,040
get our global

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
components uh set up in our global

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,320
module

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
in addition to that of course because

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
this is kind of like a standalone

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,560
feature we wanted to have

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,880
a standalone search module which

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,440
required its own set of view components

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
and

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
in architecture but through what if you

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,120
can see here looking

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,000
at the slide we set up our

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,760
search module to contain i think we

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,480
ended up with maybe

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
between 20 and 30 separate components

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
but

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,079
just for the sake of this example

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,760
i'm just kind of laying out some basic

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,560
components that we started with one

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,440
being search

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
which is kind of the main container of

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
search

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,560
we have filters we have sorting we have

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
a golfer card i'll explain that

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,399
event card i'll explain that in a mini

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,040
card so i'll explain that as well

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
so the architecture even though it seems

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,079
basic at the beginning we did have to

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
brainstorm it a lot at the beginning

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,399
just to make sure that

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,560
um you know it made sense for

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,320
scalability etc etc

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,320
uh go on the next slide just happy

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
all right so um is there a delay in

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
upload

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,040
or in uh visibility for you because i

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
see uh

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,640
someone else here in the chat saying

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
that they're not seeing the slides

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
updating oh they're not seeing the

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,600
slides updating

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:02,720
well if you can see okay so kevin

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,079
okay yeah so intermittent problems

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,959
everyone's favorite type of issue um

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,920
okay so it looks like most people are

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
able to see this so

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,120
the first piece um as i mentioned was

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,720
kind of

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,360
the container or the main view component

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,360
this is kind of the wrapper that every

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
other kind of mini component mini view

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,040
component is going to be plugged into

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,000
um it's it's kind of the way that you

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
want to architecture

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,399
any view application where you have your

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,839
wrapper container and you just plug in

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
all your different view components but

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
because this was kind of a small

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,160
view application that we're plugging in

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
to one page on the site

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,079
we kind of need to componentize that as

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,399
well uh let's move on to the next

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:52,160
slide giuseppe if you could absolutely

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,880
so using that main search component

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
you can see

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
that um we're utilizing various

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,160
components across

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,639
not just the search module but

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,680
our global module as well so we're

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,639
bringing in

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,480
a teaser which you can see uh surrounded

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,360
by the orange outline

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
uh whenever we bring back search results

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
that teaser

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,760
component is being rendered to use that

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,279
those search results the data from

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,720
search results and just

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,120
you know obviously show a basic ui but

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
it makes us be able to choose different

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,200
pieces from various modules across the

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,839
site and display them that way

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,880
we have other various modules components

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
rather

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,639
in our search module so we've got our

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,160
filters which

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,639
allows the user to filter by

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
content type pretty basic we have our

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,160
sorting feature

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,279
which allows users to sort by relevance

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,920
which is inelastic search function

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,600
uh as well as by date um obviously run

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
by elasticsearch but a separate

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
component

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,839
in itself just because there's

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
functionality there that we want to be

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
able to

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,519
manipulate and build upon as the project

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,959
grows so you can see

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,079
just in the the initial um

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,959
main component we're placing you know

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,040
right off the bat

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,720
four or five different mini components

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,360
just to be able to talk to each other

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,800
and do different things

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,360
now main a main piece of our search

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,320
was to be able to bring back specific

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
golfer cards

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,519
or event cards meaning if you search for

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,399
a golfer or an event a special

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,360
ui element or golfer card needs to come

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,120
back with some specialized content that

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,120
we're ingesting from our scoring

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
application uh elsewhere just have

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,279
people explain a little bit more about

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
the scoring

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,279
piece of it but that's kind of the start

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,560
of that um head on to the next

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,560
slide if you could just have it

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,000
okay there you go event card yep no no

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,720
worries yeah so this one's

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
obviously very similar but the event

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
card

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,720
works the same way as a golfer card

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
whenever you're doing a search for a

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,800
specific event

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,079
we need to bring back event data from

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
our scoring

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,920
endpoints and make sure that the user's

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,440
getting stuff that's relevant to them

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
we're providing you know

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
you know the best information we can

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
based on whatever their search is

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,839
so very similar golf cart just related

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,720
to events

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,720
specifically uh next slide

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,880
now another requirement um at golf

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
channel they had

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,800
a lot of different uh tv shows that they

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,519
broadcast either on a daily basis or

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,120
weekly basis so on and so forth so we

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
have these mini cards which is a

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,920
separate

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,600
component whenever you searched or

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,240
someone searched for

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
a show that golf channel puts on it

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
would show a mini card

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,120
at the top of search results and then

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
quickly show

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,880
your teasers so just another example of

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,160
how

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,680
a different variation of a component can

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,920
just be plug and play

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,760
into the view application as a whole

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,760
next slide if you could

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
all right so this one was a little

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,920
tricky

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,720
some uh of the talent at golf channel

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,240
is also an active golfer or a previous

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,279
golfer or somebody in our

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,320
in our scoring uh endpoint as

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,040
uh who has data right so there's there's

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
a gentleman

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,720
randall champley who not only hosts

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
his own show and his talent at golf

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
channel but has a golfer card

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
so using a lot of different logic under

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
the hood we had to make sure that we

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,399
could bring back a golfer card

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,240
and a uh a show card or a talent card

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,720
plus all of the teasers

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
plus filter it plus sorted et cetera et

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
cetera

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,560
and make it all work but with vue it

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,839
makes it

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,160
super super simple um i wasn't the view

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
guys

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,240
clear not the most simple thing in the

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,480
world because

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,440
each one of those highlighted items the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
data is coming from

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
separate entity types that's true right

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,839
across the site

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,800
so i guess compared to how we would have

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,000
done it without you

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,880
it makes it very simple view

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
views is a powerful tool that's really

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,360
really made this

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,759
um you know a three month project as

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,279
compared to like a six month project uh

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,800
so go on to the next slide

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:40,240
this epi now the requirement

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,000
was uh an autocomplete list so

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
originally we wanted to bring back

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,759
autocomplete directly from

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,240
elasticsearch but we just didn't have

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,920
time to uh to build that out

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,279
so essentially what we had to do was

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,480
create a list a cached list in the

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,680
drupal database in a custom table

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,199
of all of the golfers and events that we

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
want in the autocomplete list

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,360
and in total on golf channel there's

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,559
probably between 10 and 12

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,160
000 so you can't just uh you can't just

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,919
you know hit our scoring endpoint and

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,760
render that list every single time you

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,240
land on the page so we had to make sure

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
that

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,319
we set up a crime task to be able to

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,199
um create an object cache it in our

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,600
database

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,679
uh cache it pretty heavily elsewhere so

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,160
that when you land on the page that

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
article that huge autocomplete list is

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
is ready to use right off the bat so

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,919
that was another big feature it's not

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,240
exactly tied to view but it is

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
uh some view functionality that we

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,200
needed

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,600
um also tied into scoring some golfers

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,799
are a part of multiple tours uh for

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,559
instance this guy

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,799
bernard longer he he's uh a

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
senior golfer but he also is good enough

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
to still play on

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,160
some of the main tours um so we needed

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,760
to be able to

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,799
componentize his statistics meaning

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,559
whenever you um switch

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,320
you know if you can see in the slideshow

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,240
there if you switch the tour

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,919
you get a different set of statistics

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
showing in the golfer card and so on and

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
so forth

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,320
uh if you go to the next slide just

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,840
happy same thing go just uh

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,880
just to hop in real quick because i

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,240
haven't read in the chat here um

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,919
so we are actually utilizing view x

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
pretty heavily

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,280
throughout this entire project and

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
that's one um

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,320
it's one thing to get through once we

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
get through search is that

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,080
one of the complications that you can

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,919
run into when you are

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,640
handling everything sort of as its own

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,720
module placed across the site

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,679
is that you're going to probably want a

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,280
lot of shared view x stores

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
um and yes kevin he was talking about

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
storing all of those autocomplete

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,760
options as an object

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,440
in the database already serialized so

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,840
that they can just grab it

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
put it into view x and then begin

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,520
parsing filtering all that stuff

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,280
but we wanted to make sure that the json

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,679
object was already created

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,600
and cached ahead of time on cron to make

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,080
sure that we can

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,120
get quick response times on that for the

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,640
question about

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,280
caching we have varnish

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,600
uh memcache and the drupal internal

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
cache

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,760
we have a lot of layers which makes

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,799
debugging cache issues fun

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,520
um but we also do um

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,559
a lot of traffic especially when tiger's

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,080
playing

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,720
so yeah um

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
yeah anyway what i was saying about vuex

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,679
um just to finish that

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
and it's actually something that stuart

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
brings up is that um

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,440
what we're doing on the initially

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
initialization of search

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
is actually preceding the vue x store

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,360
with

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,400
um just a quick call out to that cached

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,559
object we just

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
snatch it user doesn't have to do

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,400
anything

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,760
normally anyone that visits the site

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
more than once has that

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,320
um already pre preloaded in their local

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,120
storage which is

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
pretty convenient but to just hit on the

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
point i was saying because people are

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,960
asking about vuex

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,360
when you have all of these independent

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
applications because effectively search

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,960
the point that we're trying to drive at

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,039
here is the complexity that you can get

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
to in a single feature

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,559
that lives on its own search is a fully

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,320
featured

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,320
web app our scoring is its own web app

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,640
we have user personalization areas

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,200
called my golf that is

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
a big thing each of those wants to have

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
shared a certain amount of shared data

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
so they each have

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,400
individual store modules

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,919
registered to a global store that we're

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,919
instantiating before anything else on

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,559
the site loads the site loads up

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,240
and our base module the one that eric

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,039
brought up earlier that has our global

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
teasers

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,320
and just basic styled reusable

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
components

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,880
instantiates a store everything else

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,880
registers itself as a module

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,480
to that store as it's needed

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
that's the only way we've been we've

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,799
found that reliably allows us to

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,000
piecemeal as someone hits a feature it

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,320
plugs itself in

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,360
and then we can access everything user

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
data

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,720
um where they're coming from because

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
again we serve things differently for

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,679
europe versus the united states

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,520
um all of that is handled in view x and

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
everything is handled um via registering

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,919
custom modules

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,880
cool okay no no it's rejecting it over

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
back to you eric

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
like joseph he's like wicked smart so

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,039
yeah

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,960
everything he said was spot on um again

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
he's kind of the the architect behind

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
getting all this started in the first

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
place so it was a huge help for

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,640
for the rest of us just kind of hitting

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,320
the ground running when we actually had

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,520
to build out these features

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,840
um yeah go on and go on to the

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
the next slide just up yeah pretty sure

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
it's almost getting wrapped up on search

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,600
here

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,600
yeah okay so

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,200
so we got the computer kid so so at the

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,760
beginning of the project

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,600
you know obviously maybe not everybody

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,799
but i felt a little overwhelmed i was

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,440
new to view um you know it's something i

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
i dabbled in a little bit but wasn't too

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
experienced with and by the end just

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,919
because

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
you know a lot of hands-on experience

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,679
but having it architected

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,400
properly uh just made it so much easier

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
uh to work with and um you know i'll

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,520
certainly be working on it on future

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
projects i know we have a lot of

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,039
properties at

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
nbc that will will be utilizing view

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,720
with so

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,919
um it's it's a valuable tool and it's

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
allowed me to

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,679
build out some some features that i

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,480
didn't think i'd be able to do

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,400
uh on my own previously so uh yeah that

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,559
was golf channel search in a nutshell

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
obviously there's a lot more to it but

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,600
um it was a great project

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,880
and uh you know something that you know

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,159
is totally possible

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,080
totally totally possible all right so

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
quick pause so eric did you ever get

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,360
that note actually running

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,440
because if not you can still show off

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,880
the code and i will walk everyone

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,280
through what's supposed to be happening

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,919
so i didn't get it running but let's go

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
have fun

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
and yeah i can share my screen and we

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
can look at the code

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,880
all right so apologies everyone will be

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
doing this a little bit more old school

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,640
than

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,960
anyone hoped for but we're going to get

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
to um we're going to get to those menu

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
questions i know a lot of people were

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,919
asking about them

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
how big our team is uh what geez what

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
are we at right now

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
three i mean in terms of actual

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,440
development

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,039
we have a front-end developer but um

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
well i don't want to say but our

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,679
front-end developer is actually coming

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
along quite nicely

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,480
and being able to use vue that's i think

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
again one of the strengths of you

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,520
compared to something like jsx

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,799
or react or angular which takes a little

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,480
bit more

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,159
um like diving into

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
view a lot of the time just looks like

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
html and you just dump css in a style

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
tag if you use single file components

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
which we do

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,919
so our frontend developer is able to

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,360
very

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,440
oh wow eric please you're sharing the

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,640
video conference

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
stop that oh

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,080
um yeah vue was able to get even our

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,600
front end developer onboarded very

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,679
quickly into dealing directly with the

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,960
data iterating on stuff

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,559
all we had to do as back-end developers

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
as much as anyone is a front-end or

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,240
back-end developer anymore

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,840
was create endpoints that actually

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
accessed our data and sent back json

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,600
responses

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,120
thank you travis and

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,000
just to reiterate on what eric was

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,679
saying no one on our team

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,039
if i include everyone is probably five

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
people at that point that actually had

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,000
to touch the code

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,480
no one on our team had used vue at all

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
and all of them were able to get up and

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,320
running

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,159
in a handful of days because

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,760
view and the vue docs make it really

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,720
really simple to just

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,159
dive in the template syntax kind of

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,400
makes intuitive sense for a lot of

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,400
people

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,039
and i think the ease of entry

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
into the view ecosystem is is one of the

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,679
points that really allowed us to

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,000
convince

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
um the people higher up in the chain

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,559
that hey we can do this it's not going

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,600
to slow anything down

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,360
and yes uh claire vuex is

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
uh very similar to the redux store

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,200
they're both based off of the same

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
underlying methodology called flux

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
that's why it's view x

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,559
and redux so they're almost

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
interchangeable

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,960
um our one react

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,960
dev first time he made a ux store

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,480
made it exactly the same as a redux

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,840
store and we only had to correct a few

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
minor

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,200
compilation errors and it worked so

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,799
while they

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,720
aren't really interchangeable because

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,000
there's different coding standards in

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,799
the different communities

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,799
they're very similar

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,000
so all right um

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,080
eric has got the code here pulled up

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,679
let's start talking about how you can

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,880
make a menu an existing drupal menu into

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,600
a

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
um a view menu uh do you want to pull up

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
gc base

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,640
yup i'm there can you can you see my

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,279
screen all right

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,279
your screen just fine um

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,880
do me one favor real quick um

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:54,000
sure you know

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,039
i'll i'll do it i forgot

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,480
we thought we were going to play cool

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,320
and not give everyone a huge slideshow

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,799
to have to pay attention to

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,400
um and it only now occurs to me

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
can't do it i'm on my desktop i'm sorry

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,039
eric go to the

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,400
go to the plug-in list and um we need to

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,679
we need to get the plug-in

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,159
that actually makes all this possible

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,279
the plug-in list what do you mean

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
drupal's

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,559
extended like the modules list oh god

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
you got it okay

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,440
and then we're getting requests that you

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,279
zoom in on your um screen

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,840
uh let's see i've done this before

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,000
in php storm but let me see if i can

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,320
find i think it's just command plus

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,840
you can zoom in oh yeah and everyone can

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,960
double click to make the win the window

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,760
bigger

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
that's true as well um tony wilson is

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,600
drupal still hardcore in the react camp

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,200
as far as i can tell yeah the drupal

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,240
community seems to be pretty hardcore

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
into

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,480
moving forward with the react which

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,080
makes me a little sad but it also means

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,640
that if we're going

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,399
like json api support first it should be

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,840
really easy to port in any

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,840
framework so

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
give me a hot second to get into the uh

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,600
the plug-ins list here

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,600
and which one did you need me to uh to

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,760
enable

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,440
is that um not enable i just need the

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,120
actual official name of the list i

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,120
forgot i was i needed to make

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,679
to put that in the slides i i apologize

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,679
to everyone

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
menu to json api i know there's a way to

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
get

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,200
a list of plugins with rush i just

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,960
forget what it is no i think it's just

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,279
called json menu

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,320
might just be called json menu i will

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,320
have to put it in the chat

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
um

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,440
i do not see it oh oh in the key

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,039
see we uh we're kept too busy right now

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,960
to actually have attended the keynote

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,480
and i'm very excited to hear that react

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,919
and view are going to be

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,320
the targets of support sweet

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,039
and as for whether or not i would have

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,159
it remain

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,799
agnostic i think as long as it's not

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
onerous on any like i don't want it to

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
be too hard on anybody to

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,690
choose the framework of their choice i'd

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
hate to see drupal become

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,679
[Music]

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,480
a cms that you use with react or a cms

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,200
that you use with vue for that matter

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,399
i want to see it accessible to anybody

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,960
that wants to use it whatever they're

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,960
comfortable with

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
so what am i looking for here giuseppe i

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,200
don't see

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,799
json menu anything with menu

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,039
yeah nothing custom menu okay you know

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,039
what

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,559
we are we are deep in it that's the menu

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
links

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,960
nope nope nope don't worry about it

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
don't worry about it i will i will share

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
the link with everybody

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,559
and the final material that we put out i

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,080
apologize i completely forgot this one

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,399
step of our demo

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,720
oh my god it might be rest menu tree you

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,760
might be my hero

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,880
menu tree this guy it is

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
it's rest menu tree

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,000
yep okay cool thank you

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,600
sean i completely forgot to uh

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,480
to put that on our list um

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,440
yeah to make menus work you do need

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,360
something

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,320
you could write the module yourself but

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,679
as sean was kind enough to share here

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,399
the rest menu tree module exists in the

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
contrib

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,720
and it will allow you to have a rest

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,039
endpoint that will give you

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
your menu items and looks like stewart

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,240
is working on the json api version which

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,960
i already i started

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,120
but i got pulled into a lot of new

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,519
initiatives for nbc sports and don't

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,480
know when i'll be able to finish it so

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,480
you go stewart

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,399
if i can if i can find my old code and

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
if you want to

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,399
oh you did share the github i could find

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
my old code and it matches at all like

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,039
i'll be able to contribute

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,039
i will i'll bookmark it

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,240
so and i'm glad to hear that improved

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
menu api support

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,840
part of the chemo point is the funny

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,360
story of the

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,039
rest menu tree module is that the person

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,880
who made it

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,039
at some point worked for golf channel

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,799
no one on the current team knows the

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,399
person

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,679
but when i clicked on their name to see

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,880
who they were they list golf channel

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,440
and that was beautiful it was

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
serendipitous to me point is

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,399
if you um

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
install that module or one of these

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,440
other future initiatives that seems to

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
be in the works

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
and you get access to the json feed of

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,440
your menu

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,799
everything becomes very you're changing

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,440
your size up yeah because it is

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,000
everyone's right it's very blurry yeah

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,919
do that yeah let me see if i can

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,799
pump it up uh doesn't seem to be

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,799
grabbing

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,240
um let's see

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,799
it's been a while since i've had to do

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
this in php storm so i apologize i'm

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,519
trying to figure this out here

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,159
control plus isn't doing it no no it's

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,640
not

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
it's not

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
can you do scroll zoom are you on your

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,679
mac yes

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,919
view appearance presentation we have ann

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,919
here

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:44,799
presentation all right

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,919
let's see no that's version control

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:52,320
i'll assume it's in the view menu

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,320
not not in preferences oh okay

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,600
this is my fault for never realizing the

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,120
screen looked blurry

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,120
when we were doing this testing

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,480
appearance second option there we go

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,159
thank you

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,320
and enter presentation mode

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,480
answer presentation mode

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
is this any better for anybody there we

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,559
go that looks better

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,080
oh wow that's so much better amazing

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,279
much better okay

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,559
uh uh

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,880
pardon me how do i get back to the

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,360
navigation dammit all right

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,360
um

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,519
yeah sure probably should have prepped

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,840
for this a little better i didn't

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,840
anticipate the uh

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,960
see if it pops up your navigator there

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
we go

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,120
god these people are so smart thank you

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,080
oh that one was me

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,880
oh that was you yeah i told you guys he

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,159
was wicked smart

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,840
all right all right tell me finally

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,880
we may begin i apologize everybody

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:09,760
um yeah if you

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,760
go into our components here

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,119
[Music]

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,679
you should see demo menu demo menu

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,480
look at that all right just scroll down

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,480
to the script

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,159
all right so in its most basic form

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,280
the way to convert a menu and i i

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,200
apologize

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,960
eric's computer's a mess today as you've

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,919
clearly seen

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,359
we're not gonna be able to show you the

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,960
final product but the final product was

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,320
just an unstyled list

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,399
so fine

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,320
um what we're doing here is we're on

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,919
mount you can do this as part of an init

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
function you can do it however you want

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,159
i'm simply reaching out getting the menu

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,960
that we want

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,160
you can build that string in the get

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,880
dynamically

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,240
we're using axios here you can do an

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,440
actual fetch

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,560
request you know i'm not here to dictate

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,560
your tools

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,760
axios is pretty standard but

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,680
you know there's a dozen options once

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,320
you have the json format

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,800
all you need to do is grab the actual

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
data

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,560
you can see i'm doing that with a simple

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,680
response call

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,640
using lodash because while i wanted to

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,839
reduce our

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,040
global dependencies we haven't yet so we

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,599
still have lodash

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,640
um eric where are you going oh you're

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,320
showing everyone

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
yeah i just wanted to show them the

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,240
actual structured data here

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,200
yeah so what i'm doing is just mapping

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,400
all of the response

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,079
coming back from that rest endpoint

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,440
each one has a link so i'm just mapping

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,359
however you want to do it i'm grabbing

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,760
each link entry

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,960
putting it into an array and i'm storing

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,359
that array

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,440
congratulations you have all of the

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,320
necessary json data to make your link

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,160
work

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
um can you go back and just zoom in on

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,200
that sure

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,640
yep because it's kind of small zoom in

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,000
on a single

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,680
link great so here you

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,280
have the weight you have the title

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,960
the target everything you have the

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,079
direct node

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,240
that it goes to you have the alias so

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
you can construct this in a dozen ways

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
and you can even

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,200
theoretically if you want to give

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,720
somebody a very customizable menu that

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,720
they can drag around

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,960
you have a weight value and you can

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,599
modify that

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,160
and just move things around what our

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,520
example

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,200
is is literally the most

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,280
basic form of that if you want to go

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,680
back to the code eric

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,160
and then go up to the template what i've

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,680
done is now that i have

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,720
um this this will work um with multiple

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,160
languages

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,280
um but it will require you to have all

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,880
of your rest endpoints

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,880
set up to serve the different um stuff i

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,079
i know that i had i talked to somebody

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,040
who did have

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,480
uh english and french set up but i don't

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,160
personally

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,079
um know exactly the steps to go in to

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,440
make that happen because we haven't

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,040
needed to yet

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,520
um r.i.p

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,640
golf channel latin america that we

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,640
haven't gotten around to yet

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,000
where are you at man yeah it's uh it's

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,480
starting to freeze on me a little bit

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,640
oh no give me uh give me a hot second

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,640
here

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
all right where'd it go

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,720
oh yes uh thank you stewart for catching

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,079
that question which i missed

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,119
um yeah it's just it's those are drupal

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
menus that are

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,680
literally admin structure menus you

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,359
build out the menu exactly like you

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,000
would for a normal drupal menu

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,800
and it exposes that data as a series of

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
link objects

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,280
while we're having to full-on restart

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,640
phpstorm

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,680
well hopefully for those of you who

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,119
have used for loops before um

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,200
you have an idea where i'm going with

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,000
this now that you have all of the

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,440
json objects in an array you can just

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,280
loop over them and begin building out

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,880
the markup however you want

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,480
abe coleman says he knows what your

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,839
problem is

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,720
what's my problem oh it's that you're

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:47,760
using a mac

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:50,720
well they're provided so

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,720
there we go okay

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,359
we're back okay so

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,119
yes steve i am getting to that

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,400
immediately after we show you the

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,880
actual loop to build the yeah

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,880
um

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,320
there was a question that i just saw

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,240
from claire um

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,359
i did mention a map a second ago claire

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,520
that was

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
me for mapping the link objects to an

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,560
array

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,760
just into that menu items variable that

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
you see

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:28,000
on the screen right now in the data

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:31,280
but after that i'm using views built-in

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,480
v4 directive so you'll see that i'm just

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,800
choosing for each link in menu items

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,720
i'm setting a key you can actually set

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,839
that key to basically anything

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,839
i'm using the actual entity id um

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,000
you're moving the screen around and then

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,640
i'm just

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,079
inside these items i'm dropping the link

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,599
url and the link title

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
it's the most basic implementation

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,240
possible for this but it gets the job

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,760
done

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,800
we've done more complicated things we've

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,160
actually put these menus inside of

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,520
swiper

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,200
so that we can do a bunch of back and

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
forth stuff uh built them into cards

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,960
once they're in that json format you can

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,000
do anything you want with the markup

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,319
but let's get to the important part the

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
part that makes this work can you go to

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:24,319
the demo.js

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:28,000
script yes

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,520
demo js

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,520
we rambled about search for a little bit

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,000
longer than i think we intended

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:40,400
um and didn't get to the meet

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,400
until just now but um

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,440
this right here ignoring the first two

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,160
lines which i honestly should have

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,440
gotten rid of

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,119
um is basic view

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,480
implementation we're importing view

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,960
we're importing the demo menu component

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,720
uh julianne i believe all of the

00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,240
sessions are being recorded

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,599
and you'll be able to get them later yes

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,560
no worries and rebecca this is

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,839
partially decoupled on its way to fully

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,839
decoupled for us but

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,319
the goal is to show you how to do one

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,240
block at a time

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,599
what we have here is a basic view

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,599
implementation we're looking for

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,960
and element sorry an element with an id

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,480
of demo menu

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,560
we're giving it a name and we're saying

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,599
hey inside of that

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,000
look for the demo menu now eric get us

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,640
to the templates

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,240
yes all right there is the block

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,599
template

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,839
uh is it in where

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,319
where is that uh

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,000
in this directory do you remember where

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,040
i put it

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,359
above view template actually before that

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,240
let's go to the block oh that's what

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,319
we're doing right now

00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,119
sean um so if you go to source

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,480
source plug-in block go all the way and

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,640
you'll find the demo block

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,560
um so to make this work once you have

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,599
the component built

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,440
all i've done is generate

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,079
an empty block i use drupal console and

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,960
i just literally drupal generate plug-in

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,000
block

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,280
um i don't worry about the markup all we

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,640
need is a block

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,640
and the ability to attach

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,319
to attach a menu

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,000
i'm sorry to attach a template

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,480
um so you can see here i have a build

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
here

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000
um technically we could get rid of the

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,040
markup it doesn't matter um

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,880
because we are doing build theme

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,680
demo menu now if you go to templates

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:59,839
eric

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:59,839
you'll find the demo menu template

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,680
you can see that yes and that's it this

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,520
is the entire

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,760
the entire sauce um

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,960
we actually we had one of our lead

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,800
developers had some

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,800
issues with um pdb when they tried it

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
sean um i'm not actually sure what it

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,720
was um

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,480
we were already kind of deep into

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,079
figuring out how we were going to get

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,200
some of this stuff done before we

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,560
even came across it but if it works it

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
sounds like the exact same concept

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,680
eric can you open up the directory tree

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,280
so people can see

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,680
yeah what we have here is just a

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,240
template for the block

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,599
and you can literally put in that id

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,280
that you're looking for

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,760
for view and then the component tag

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,800
everything inside that id is going to be

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
read by view

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,760
and instantiated

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,119
do you load the view app yet we

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,119
load one entry point for our global

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,400
um sorry i'm trying i should read the

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,680
answer a question then read the chat i

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,119
get distracted

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,119
uh it's the the add

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,720
we load one global entry point for all

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,839
of our view apps

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,960
um that are that have global access that

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,680
are going to be found all across the

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,400
site

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,400
but for something like this um we would

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,319
actually probably just attach

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,599
we would make a library and attach it

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,720
directly to the block

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,240
you should actually be able to see that

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,560
i did that if you go to the libraries

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,560
eric

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,480
but since you can attach libraries

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,400
directly to a block that's normally how

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,599
i do it you can either attach it in the

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,160
build array

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,240
or in the template the same way you

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,839
would attach any other library

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,520
i just make that initial

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,359
vue.js app and i attach it as a library

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,720
that way whenever it's needed it loads

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,359
it looks for it

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,480
because the libraries are loaded first

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,079
um

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,680
so yes

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,880
clara's got it you just literally drop

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
the component into the twig file once

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,560
you have everything set up

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,560
it works if you use grade um

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,599
vishal i will find a way to

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,359
share a actual like proper demo um the

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,839
problem was we without thinking built

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,720
this

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,079
in our site and i need to actually get a

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,520
fresh drupal installation that we can

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,000
just slap a demo in

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,839
um but i will add that to our resources

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,839
once we do

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,240
as for whether or not it is good

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,000
practice to use the view component

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,400
inside the twig template

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,400
it should be because all you're really

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,480
doing is dropping a custom html

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,640
element into the markup which is where

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,640
it belongs um

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,760
any custom html markup whether it be vue

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,880
or a custom web component or whatnot

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,160
that's where it would live

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,240
and i think that's the place you would

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,720
do it

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,240
stuart asks if uh since we've done

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,680
progressively decoupled and we wanted to

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,599
do fully decoupled

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,599
um i have

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,920
done a few personal projects where i

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,880
still do partial decoupling

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,599
um simply because when i make a very

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,280
simple site

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,520
i don't need um

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,200
i don't need the complexity of like a

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,640
single page application i can just serve

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,760
up static pages

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,000
um i've experimented with a couple of

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,880
the

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,480
options that try to do the sort of next

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,240
thing but with a drupal back end and

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,319
that's worked out pretty well

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,400
i will say for our newest initiative at

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,680
mbc sports we are going fully decoupled

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,280
from the beginning i do think that's

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,240
probably the future

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,119
of the cms but as long as the option

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,599
remains

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,880
to take things a region at a time or a

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:10,880
block at a time

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:14,319
it's good to just have

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,599
uh bobby wants to know yeah stork please

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,680
hit me up

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,000
um stewart wants to know what we were

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,640
using cron to cache some of the json

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,599
oh um to create the object in our cache

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,000
table

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,640
we literally created a custom table in

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,920
drupal

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,599
um to store cachable objects we created

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,800
a json response

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,680
and we stored it there that's basically

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
it

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,160
after that we cached the end point to

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,760
get it so whatever the response from the

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,079
endpoint is that retrieved that

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,880
that's what we're caching aggressively

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,640
so

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:53,359
akamai varnish and the drupal

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,079
cache are all sort of layering on there

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,079
uh julian

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,400
um julianne the entire reason that we

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,400
ended up going with vue

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,760
is to bypass the jsx issue

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,000
there is compiling that has to be done

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,040
um like php you can just go and live

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,240
edit the php and it would technically

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:22,240
serve up again but

00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,760
view does require a compile step but

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,640
i don't know that that's a huge issue

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,480
because all of our css is already having

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,079
to get compiled

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,680
where we're using it that's a separate

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,720
talk that we almost did about how we're

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,720
moving away from that

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,040
and all of our other javascript needs to

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,800
get compiled so it's a very small ask to

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,800
go hey compiler templates as well

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,400
yeah i don't i don't know that that's

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
been an issue

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,440
jsx has its own issues i think it's a

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,359
little bit confusing for

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,319
new developers but all of them

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,319
they just have to compile

00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,880
um

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,000
and dan is just uh wanting to know

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,839
why we're going to go fully decoupled in

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,520
the future um

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,760
to give a little bit of a preview of our

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,680
thinking it's basically so that

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,040
a lot of our properties can share a

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,640
single cms

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,079
in the back end we want to use drupal

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,480
for everything

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,079
and then serve out individual custom

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,839
builds for the

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,400
actual displays of like golf channel has

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,599
its own thing nbc sports proper has its

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,880
own thing

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,480
there's a whole bunch of little sub

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,599
properties and side sites like things we

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,640
do for the olympics

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,720
all of those can have their own just

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,720
full spa builds that are just getting

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,400
data in so that's actually

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,079
um it's less fully decoupled than it is

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,599
just like we're building we're going to

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,599
be building like six different sites

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,720
and we want them all to use the same

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
back end source so

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,480
a lot of people talking about build

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,800
processes yeah we just use webpack

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,319
um to put everything together i think

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,359
for our new stuff going forward we're

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,640
going to do the individual sites

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,079
probably just view cli

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,079
which is still webpack but

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,280
restful gene we can customize the fields

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,280
the same way we do in json api

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:23,839
um no the the rest

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,760
api is not as sort of fluent as the json

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,079
api

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,200
which is why we only use it right now

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,480
for the menus and

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,640
since it looks like we might have

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,680
options soon to use json api for menus

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,680
we'll be switching over to that

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,680
do we use apache um

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,520
we're our site's on aqua so i'd have to

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,800
say whatever aqua uses like

00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,280
is that nginx do you know eric

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,520
i don't normally mess with our our

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,119
hosting site

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,640
aqui is apache there we go we're using

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,960
apache

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,000
i use nginx on everything so that's just

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,000
me my biases

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,079
um and yeah lucas is out here talking

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,319
about laravel mix which

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,000
the dirty secrets of a golf channel is

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,119
that's that's all we use

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,559
um i think we're going to do custom like

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,400
we're going to do some configuration

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,599
stuff to use view cli for our stuff

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,880
going forward

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,040
but me at my heart

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,720
most of my custom projects are larval

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,640
and vue

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,520
my professional stuff is all drupal in

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,240
view so i still use mix

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,440
that's larval mix.com if anyone here is

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,440
scared of webpack

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,599
and wants a really easy way to get into

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,599
it

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,839
thank you lucas rasmussen let's see and

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,200
demo of views and views block support

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,040
stuart is out here

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,240
with more valuable stuff than our talk

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,119
everyone should just be listening to

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,920
stuart clark

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,920
all the time

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,800
but that's basically it if anyone has

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,640
any more questions i'm going to be here

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,640
for

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,680
i guess however long the stay is open

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,119
not that long

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,319
be here for a few more minutes answering

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,040
questions because i don't think the next

00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,079
round of

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,800
sessions starts uh for another like

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,800
seven minutes but

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,040
yeah basically the end goal is just

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,280
build as complicated a thing as you want

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,640
as long as you can build out

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,160
uh it to a single wrapper component

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,839
you can drop the entire thing in twig

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,680
that works for region templates it works

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,319
for block templates it works for

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,599
page templates and we're using all of

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,599
them at various points on our site

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,599
final thoughts eric i think you covered

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,400
it

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,640
you're a rock star man yeah i have the

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,640
hair

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,839
so yeah i'll like i said i'll kick back

00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,319
for a few more minutes because i think

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,880
the next

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,559
session round of session starts at 4 15.

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,119
so if anyone has questions

00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,680
i'm here otherwise enjoy the rest of

00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,680
your days

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,480
thanks guys

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,760
um i believe there's at least based on

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,240
what i was reading there's going to be a

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,599
area steve where um we put our

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,319
slide deck not that there was much of

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,760
that and can add in anything we want

00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,800
i'll be updating everything there and

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:32,240
i'm going to try to get a working

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,880
demo and code base for you guys

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,319
but if not if it turns out that i'm

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,720
lying right now

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,839
because i have a bad memory you can

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,800
reach out to me

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,520
my information is in my drupal profile

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,520
you can hit me on twitter

00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,160
that's probably the best place and i

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:57,839
will get you anything you want

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:57,839
that way just hit me up find me

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,240
and this is eric and giuseppe sitting

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,480
yeah that's the most exciting part

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,480
um

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,440
talk about what site component you might

00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,359
create next with view

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:25,280
um for our next major feature

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,040
um home page yeah if we had the chance i

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,559
don't know that we're going to get

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,640
a chance before we end up redoing

00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,760
everything because it's just the way

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,960
sort of the business priorities are

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,440
right now

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,880
but if none of the new priorities had

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,119
come in and taken effect

00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,160
we were going to redo our entire home

00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,200
page as a

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,200
large just

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,200
feed just so that we could dynamically

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,799
load content because we have

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,240
so much on our homepage that google

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,160
sometimes yells at us for having too

00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,119
many html nodes

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,160
which is a problem so we really wanted

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,799
to

00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,520
take our home page and modernize it let

00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,400
it load

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,680
dynamically and be able to change things

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,599
out based on the user

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,440
because you can favorite players you can

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,480
favorite events and stuff and we really

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,520
we wanted to get a lot more

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,520
customizability in

00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,520
the taco we have not actually linked to

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,799
the slides yet i

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,079
need to go in and figure out where we'll

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:27,920
we can edit all that in but i want to

00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,200
get a link to our demo code and the

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,400
slides

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,760
attached to the vod of this talk but if

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,400
you need anything sooner please

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,000
thank you joe parsons uh go to my

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,640
profile i think i have contact

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,040
information

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
in there and if i don't i will update it

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,920
immediately after this talk and you can

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,480
reach out to me directly with any

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,680
questions

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,359
links to anything i'll hook you up no

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,760
contact info see okay say i'm going to

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,960
do that right now

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,480
eric read some of this stuff answer

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,000
questions for me

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
giuseppe just said he doesn't want

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
anybody contacting him no i think what

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,000
happened is i got hired at a

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,599
national company and scrubbed all of my

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,200
stuff because

00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,599
i don't know that my twitter profile is

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,520
exactly what nbc wants to see attached

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,640
to them

00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:20,240
but you know needs must and so i'm doing

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,240
it personal contact form

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:28,319
there we go i did see a question earlier

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,520
uh i think it was vishal yeah vishal

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,839
i don't know if he's still here or not

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,839
but he was asking uh how we were

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,040
actually connecting to elasticsearch for

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,640
our search page

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,880
uh whether or not we were using a

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,839
contributed module or

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,240
doing it else uh elsewhere so we

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:47,280
actually built out a custom module

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,960
to connect to elasticsearch when we

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,280
built things out in solar

00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,839
previously we used the contributed

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,040
search api module and search api solar

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,880
module

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,480
those are really simple to use but when

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,640
we switched over to elasticsearch we

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,040
just built it out custom

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,040
so we hit elasticsearch directly

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,520
all right great so i have updated

00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,680
my uh updated my profile now it should

00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,359
have some contact information there

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,960
um yeah it shows twitter that's amazing

00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:29,200
great and that's enough

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,200
um

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:37,440
yeah i totally agree stewart um

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,160
yeah with search we again search api

00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,520
solar was

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,599
was really easy to get up and get

00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,240
running um but we didn't see

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,640
as much support for elasticsearch out of

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,720
the box in a contributed module

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,480
so we just put it together ourselves uh

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,799
it you know took a little while but we

00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,160
have full control over it so

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:59,839
there's one benefit there uh difference

00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,839
between solar and elasticsearch

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,400
honestly i feel that solar had a lot of

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,440
functionality that we wanted right out

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,480
of the box

00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,559
elasticsearch requires a little bit more

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,040
prodding and massaging just to get it to

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,760
work

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,079
the way we want it but i feel that the

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,000
uh

00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,440
the data that the data structure we're

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,559
getting back from elasticsearch is a

00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,040
little bit more

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,000
cohesive makes a little bit more sense

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,079
easier to ingest

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,680
so you know if we had to do it again

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,359
we'd probably go with elasticsearch to

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,839
start

00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,680
i really liked using search api as far

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:37,200
as it went but

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,839
we had issues with the consumers

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,960
api i set it up and then i tried to do

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,280
the image styles

00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,960
per consumer because obviously we didn't

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,119
want to be serving full size images back

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,520
for everybody for just thumbnails

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,040
and really inconsistent we were

00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,119
constantly finding that we were no

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,440
longer actually getting thumbnails

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,319
um and we couldn't be serving 4 000 you

00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,640
know pixel

00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,400
like what like those giant images just

00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,920
for thumbnails

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,880
that was a huge bottleneck and we ended

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,440
up just out the window because

00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,960
the parent company nbc sports is already

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,280
using elasticsearch for things

00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,000
and once we figured out we could just

00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,200
join

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,400
their hop onto their account

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,680
we got we got in i think we plan on

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,000
contributing back to

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,559
the elasticsearch once basically

00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,680
we clear everything with uh corporate

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,280
because

00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,960
they're sometimes a little bit twitchy

00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,280
about letting just us

00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,960
drop code blindly out there in case we

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,040
accidentally let something leak

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:43,440
even though unlikely there is still

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:46,000
security concerns i guess

00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,799
uh sheila to answer your question i know

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,079
that there's still

00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:54,000
some uh debate on whether or not

00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:56,559
um analytics is effective when you're

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,040
completely decoupled um i think you're

00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,520
thinking

00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,079
seo yes you're asking about if you're

00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,760
asking about analytics we're um

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,359
for something like our search page which

01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,960
is a single page application but has

01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,799
like five different tabs and whatnot

01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,000
we're sending out per

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:13,440
page change um individual page hits with

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,119
all the relevant metadata which we

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,319
collect automatically

01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,839
it's pretty seamless really um

01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,680
because we're still registering for the

01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,880
bulk of our pages like full page hits

01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,559
when you go to the page

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,599
all of it's handled by our basic

01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:32,000
analytics implementation

01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,000
see stort knows his stuff stuart you and

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:42,400
i need to become friends

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,839
you need to find me

01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,599
he's still friends with people who don't

01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,160
know their stuff you know

01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,160
proof we're friends right giuseppe

01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,200
yes

01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,920
i you you talk me up too much yeah i'm

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,799
very interested in this drugst

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,920
that i see on your profile because that

01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,359
sounds fun

01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,319
that sounds like something that we could

01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,920
really use in a lot of our um

01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,920
a lot of things we do especially for our

01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,119
one-off like event sites

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:25,839
so definitely

01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:25,839
something i'm going to look into

01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:35,839
one line of config

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:37,599
sorcery i don't know that i approve of

01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:40,319
using black magic to get websites

01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,319
configured but

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,079
technically that is that word does so

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,680
much work

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,680
anything can be put on one line

01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:55,119
technically

01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,559
that's not so bad i've been i i had

01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,920
honestly i'd started play

01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,599
it's funny because i think this is the

01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,200
second time that we've done this i

01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,920
started playing with

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,680
um a next implementation for that

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,119
because i think it

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,880
was it last year's drupal con that we

01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,440
went to eric

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,160
uh well you didn't know was it yeah it

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,880
was me and

01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,799
tren right that was last year time is a

01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,240
flat circle nothing matters anymore

01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:22,480
um we heard a lot about tome and what

01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,520
they were doing there with um

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,039
i think using gatsby or something

01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,039
and i'm like wow i want that for view

01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,839
um and so i had started playing with

01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,039
nuxt for drupal and and to hear that you

01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:38,480
have something that's even to a

01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,480
demo-able stage is exciting

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,760
the magic of open source prs always

01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,760
welcome

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,799
all right i am

01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:56,400
what do you say or call it at 4 20.

01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:58,160
sounds good to me yeah a few more

01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,799
minutes for questions

01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,240
i'd hang around all day for you know

01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,079
with nothing better to do except

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,280
my wife and child are coming home soon

01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,319
and that

01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,760
eric will tell you impossible to get

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,359
anything done with the three-year-old

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,680
jumping on me

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,039
giuseppe rarely works during normal

01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,319
working hours

01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,839
i'm nocturnal entirely which is funny

01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:31,119
because i'm also awake during the day so

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:34,000
i just don't get to sleep anymore

01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,000
count nonsense

01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:42,960
oh mister time zone over here

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,839
trying to guess when is 6am that's

01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,839
12 hours

01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,559
i have no idea where that is

01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:54,079
[Applause]

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,760
because that's forward

01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,960
it's going to be basically right i was

01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,480
going to say all it feels like australia

01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,319
could have been new zealand maybe i

01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,960
don't know it's hard to

01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,200
okay there we go well good for you being

so add to the list of australians that i

01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,480
i respect that i

01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,119
engage with in the coding community we

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,079
have like uh what is it dorinda

01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,559
mikkel dorinda well maybe eric's not as

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,520
much of a nerd as me

01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:27,839
but the north meet south podcast is fun

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,839
everyone should listen to it

01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,680
and they have to deal with some weird

01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,000
recording times because they are they're

01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:37,520
a

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,520
split between america and australia

01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:45,680
