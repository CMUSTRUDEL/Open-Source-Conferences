bobby all right

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
seeing a bunch of friendly faces hi amy

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,480
june

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,480
okay so i think it's time we've got a

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
lot of people in our anonymous crowd

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,040
backstage it looks like more than 60

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
folks

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,080
uh listening in um and uh

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
all of our panelists here who are ready

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
to talk to you so let's get this

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,640
started um welcome to the drupal.org

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
engineering update so this is where we

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,279
talk about all of the kind of

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,760
key initiatives that the uh drupal

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,200
association engineering team works on

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
we're actually here with kind of the

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,399
extended family of the drupal

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,879
association engineering team

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,640
um some uh let's see one super volunteer

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,559
one member of our infrastructure support

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
and rachel is the community liaison who

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,760
interfaces wherever the community

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,760
overlaps the engineering needs

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,680
so i'll do introductions in just a

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,360
moment we'll be going through a lot of

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,879
the work that was done over the last six

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
months and talk a little bit about the

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
future as well

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
so we hope you're as excited as we are

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
feel free to throw in questions uh as we

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
go i'm not sure how much time we'll have

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
at the end it's a packed update but

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,360
we'll see how it goes

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,479
so hopping in to the introductions

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,320
um in the last three drupalcons i forgot

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
to put real names on this slide i always

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
put on drupal.org usernames but i fixed

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,439
it this time

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,520
we've got both um we'll go left to right

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
across the top of this slide so i'll

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
start first

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
you've seen me in several places at this

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
event so far i'm tim lennon hestinet on

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
drupal.org

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,119
i'm the cto at the drupal association

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,799
i've been here close to six years now

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
and just really proud of this team and

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
what it accomplishes

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
um oh yes there's a highlight that

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
brendan just mentioned in the chat

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,799
um if you want to make any particular

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
video feed larger you can just double

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
click

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
on that feed like the slides to make

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
them bigger and easier to see

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
neil why don't you go ahead and

north norfolk which is my

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,080
id on people.org twitter everywhere

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,879
and people start thinking it's my

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,000
surname too it's not

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,239
uh i work as a drupal association

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,640
community liaison i

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
essentially spend a lot of time chatting

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,400
to the community

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,439
finding out what's really going to help

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,480
us

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,680
grow as a work time

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,400
and then giving or making

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
increasingly increasingly complex and

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,880
challenging

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,239
tasks to the engineering team

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
there's probably the better way of

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,199
putting it i really want you to do this

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,199
can you do this

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,120
fair enough um narayan why don't you

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
introduce yourself

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
hi my name is norah newton or and newton

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,080
on what used to be irc

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,800
um i am the lead system administrator

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,759
and uh work with uh work for tag one

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,160
consulting

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
and have been and some form the lead

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
system in for dribble door for

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
a long long time pretty much since the

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
beginning he knows where all of the

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
bubble gum and bailing wire is to keep

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
the servers running uh and finally

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
uh michael please introduce yourself as

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
well i'm michael hess i've been working

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
on the infrastructure for

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,759
i don't know almost 10 years

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
now and orion are you able to help me

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,270
with my wi-fi considering this is a

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
drupal con

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,160
[Laughter]

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
i retired from that about eight years

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,960
ago

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
perfect well thank you everyone um this

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
is a brief overview of the agenda i'm

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
gonna skip

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,639
right past this but as you can see it's

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,720
chock full of different things that

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,240
we're going to talk about

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
one thing i want to say at the outset

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
you may have seen this in the drupalcon

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,440
amsterdam slides

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
if you happen to be there with us

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
drupal.org which we maintain as an

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,039
engineering team

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
is increasingly central to drupal itself

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,680
it

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
increasingly provides services that

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
support

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
um the drupal software and not just

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
services that support the community so

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
whether that's

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,880
the composer endpoints the code

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
repositories

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
the update server the localization

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
server uh handling of security

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
advisories

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,199
these are all services that are

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
supported by the drupal association

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,479
engineering team

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
and are really more part of the drupal

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
product than they are just part of our

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
community home and community website

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,440
so the support of the drupal association

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
supporting partners and sponsors

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
is what makes that possible and lets us

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
do our piece

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
of helping the community to build drupal

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
i also want to just

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
pause for a moment to thank everybody um

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
i suspect that

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
almost everybody who's attending this

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
session probably participated in the

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,960
drupal cares campaign in some way

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
this was the major fundraiser that we um

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
did in april

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,880
uh when we knew that there would be a

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,919
gap um because of the covid situation

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,759
the funding you provided um uh

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,520
i mean to put it bluntly it saved jobs

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,319
over here at the association

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,479
it got us the ability to keep going and

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
even host a drupalcon at all

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
and it got us to a sustainable place to

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
get through this year and into next year

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,639
so

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
your support was really vital and very

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
much appreciated

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
um as part of the drupal cares campaign

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,479
there were some updates

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
that neil on our team helped to

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
implement

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,199
we had some requests for different ways

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,120
to participate as a member so

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,520
there was now a monthly membership

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
option higher tier annual membership

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,520
membership options and some updated

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
options for supporting partner programs

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,120
i'm going to skip on through because

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,880
we've got so much to go but um

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639
there's some awesome stuff there another

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,080
project that neil worked on

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,440
in particular was metrics on drupal.org

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
and neil do you want to talk a little

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
bit about these kinds of visualizations

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,919
that you put together perhaps

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,800
uh sure uh screen's frozen from me so

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
i'm just gonna talk

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
and assume that something relevant's

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,960
showing

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
uh okay sounds good uh yeah the

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
first two that have been there for quite

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
a while i think most schweitzman

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
built an initial version of this that we

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,520
uh cleaned up and deployed

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,599
uh is nodes and users created by month

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,720
and that's those are

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,680
not really great numbers uh

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
because users those are mostly spammers

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,080
like we didn't get 40k

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,840
people two months in uh 2013 or whatever

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,400
that is

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,479
uh and nodes is just

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,840
not a measure of activity it's just

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,199
some piece of software so going to more

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,960
uh breaking it up into

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
things that represent actual

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,199
contribution to the project uh

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
tangible things that uh people found

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,279
useful uh so that's issue credit

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,360
and uh

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
breaking it down even further into you

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,080
know how many people

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,519
are contributing as uh volunteers

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,120
on behalf of organizations or both uh

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,000
and also uh you know we started

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,160
collecting

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
uh some numbers around uh the

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,320
demographics in the last few

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
a few years so we're starting to uh get

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
uh more numbers there for our uh

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,959
diversity

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,880
and uh you know who's coming to us from

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,760
an underserved or underrepresented

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
community

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,080
uh not just uh

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,360
uh you know color or uh nationality or

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,640
anything like that there's

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,680
uh the big ten uh

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
big eight rig 10 uh categories and this

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
page will prompt you to

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,040
fill out that question on your user

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,560
profile if you haven't already

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,360
uh and uh

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
yeah when i was down at drupal sal south

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
i

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,600
decided to add uh where people were in

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
the world

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
uh so north america europe and all of

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,240
that

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,440
and the prince those have been there for

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
a while

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,279
as well those are the original metrics

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,800
and yeah there's been a little bit of

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,399
uptick with uh drupal uh

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
drupal 9 being released it's a little

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,120
hard to say why

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
uh you know commits they could be large

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
or small so

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,160
optics are good but uh

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
you know it's hard to say whether this

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,360
is more people

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,959
or uh actually the second one commit

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,839
authors by month that's the important

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,880
one so more people uh maybe they're

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
committing less but

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,079
a number of people i think is more

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,519
important how how many

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,519
times they can type get pushed

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,079
and i think this last metric area is one

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,079
of the more interesting ones because it

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,720
shows of the current people involved

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,320
in uh contributing getting credited on

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,360
issues how many years they've been on

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,240
drupal.org

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
so you can see that stacked up cohort of

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
of um

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
whether it's you know the largest group

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
looks like it's probably the group of

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
people who've been around for about a

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
year

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
followed by the group less than a year

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
and then these equal cohorts of people

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
contributing to the project

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
um based on how long they've been around

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,240
so just some

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,360
versions of how our community works

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,640
um let's we have a steady stream of new

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,000
people who have been

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,519
uh contributing for less than a year and

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
the bars aren't getting that much

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,560
thinner as they go up so

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,360
people are staying yeah

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,360
um neil i'm skipping ahead to the uh

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
weekly project usage one could you give

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
some final thoughts on that one that's

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,839
part of

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,040
the to semantic versioning

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,760
and really drupal

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,320
eight or triple nine uh and what's more

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,040
important

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
is you know uh at least for core are you

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,440
on

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
you know eight seven eight eight nine oh

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
nine

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,760
one uh so this graph's broken up by that

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
now

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
yeah so we can get more granular data

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
about which minor versions people are

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
actually using

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,720
um i wanted to talk briefly about

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,079
community demographics while we're on

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,600
the subject of metrics

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,440
um so just so that your uh you have kind

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
of a general idea we may publish a blog

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,680
post on this sort of thing later

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
we now have 24 000 members of our

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,680
community who have

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,399
uh filled out the representation

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
information

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
in their profile the demographic fields

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,040
so that's uh

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,000
up by 25 and that's roughly 37 percent

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
of users who are active in the last year

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,959
and this is the breakdown of those

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,000
people who have chosen to report the

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,839
data

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
so we get a pretty interesting sample of

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,040
all these different axes of

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,839
representation

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,399
that are part of our community um and of

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
those

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,720
37 percent we actually see if we if we

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,480
break it down by just those respondents

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
we actually see very similar

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
numbers across those fields so our

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
sample size is getting large enough that

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
the

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,279
the data seems consistent um just to

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,480
mention this really quickly

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,839
uh i did some comparisons with other

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,519
organizations and their recent reports

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,519
can see here just briefly sort of

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
drupal's current composition based on

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,240
our respondents

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,639
versus say the github community survey

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,160
random u.s companies tech or non-tech

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,639
and google and microsoft is some

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,639
representation so

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
um there's some action that we're taking

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
this was talked about pretty extensively

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
in the drupal association update but

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,120
there's some staff trainings going

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,800
on some work to recruit um experts in

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
the field and things like

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,360
the expanded scholarships that brought

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,360
so many more people here to drupalcon

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,600
um next i'd like to talk about the

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
community events feature on drupal.org

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
so let's have rachel could you kick off

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
kind of what the ask was

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,040
um from the event organizers working

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,160
group yeah so

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,000
we we spent a lot of time uh with the

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,839
event organizers working group in their

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
very early days

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,680
working out what was it they wanted to

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,399
achieve what was it they wanted to do

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,920
and how they and one of the things they

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,199
talked about was having a better

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
understanding

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,360
of the data behind

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
events all events are driven by numbers

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
of people

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
financial data but also the types of

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,360
people who are sponsoring events the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,399
type of people who are talking at events

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
the type of people who volunteer at

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,079
events

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,639
and organize them so

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,880
we spent a lot of time looking at how we

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,880
could

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,680
create an events listing that

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,279
would show events and have use and value

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
to our wider community but also very

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,839
specifically

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,680
collected extra data that we could use

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,639
for recognizing and

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
engaging people and organizations in the

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,880
community

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,760
with regard to supporting events growing

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,079
events

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,000
making events an important part of

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,760
drupal

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,920
and we spent a lot of time

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,680
how shall we say discussing fields and

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
what they should achieve

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,959
uh in a drupal nerd uh when we

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,120
eventually came up with

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,920
what we have now so we built a whole

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
bunch of

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,000
user stories we literally had user

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
stories uh which is

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
lovely and we handed those over to the

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,079
engineering team

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
and actually it's coming along

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
you know there's quite a lot of feedback

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
from bits and pieces that we're still

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,519
improving

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,839
but it's getting there and we're really

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
happy

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,519
awesome brendan could you talk a little

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,399
bit about how this

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,000
these features were built um and kind of

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
what what went into the

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
the design from the technical point of

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
view

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
uh sure that's an interesting topic it

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,680
feels like a very long time ago but it

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
wasn't

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,160
so i mean first off uh

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
we had to figure out how to get building

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,160
maps onto drupal.org

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
so um that was that was a

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,759
exercise in figuring out what modules

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,040
did what we needed and not

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,800
way more than we needed um i'm trying to

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,720
remember the name i just blanked of the

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,920
module we wound up going with

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,959
um i think it's leaflet

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,839
i could be wrong yeah so

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,279
um because a big part of this people

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,040
people like going to web pages that look

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,759
semi-interactive and

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,279
um it's easy at a glance to kind of see

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,480
where something is when you have a map

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,480
on a page

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
um you know if something is taking place

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,839
in a city you're not familiar with

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
uh with a map on the page you don't have

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,199
to go google you know google

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
where this is to see how feasible it is

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,880
for you to be able to go

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,519
um it was

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
interesting uh because like i was a part

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,759
of

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
some of the discussions very early on

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,120
and then for a long time

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,199
while more discussions were happening i

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,279
was involved in other projects

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,279
and then right at the end when it was

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,039
like oh hey we need to build this now

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,280
uh i came back into the project and um

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,039
things had changed decisions had been

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,039
made and i didn't really know that

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,480
so um it was really interesting working

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,679
back and forth with rachel

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
to figure out what we needed and what we

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
wanted and

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,799
how we wanted to do that so it's been an

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
iterative process

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,600
uh it's still very early there's a lot

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,199
more we would love to do here

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,559
but we thought it would be better to

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,400
have something that people can start

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,760
putting data into and using

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,799
and then we would have a

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,440
a way to collect data um on their

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,320
experience

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,280
and then use that to inform um the next

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,480
chunks

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,120
of the project uh like initially we

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
we'd had some requests to record some

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,760
data about events you know like

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
money spent and uh sponsors and stuff

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,880
like that

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
and then you know a little pushback when

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
we realized oh

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,160
fields are available in the api and

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,559
maybe you know sponsors don't want to

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
necessarily disclose that information to

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
the world

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
so um stuff like that that pops up when

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,400
you're working through things like this

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,080
is always interesting

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,520
um and so yeah we just

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
careful consideration as we're moving

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,679
forward deploying things

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,799
um but it's been fun and i'm looking

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
forward to that and built in

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,919
yeah and built in really the the um you

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,320
know the kind of the standard drupal way

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,679
these are uh content types entity

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
references views

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
all of those usual things and it's

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,760
available now for people to

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,320
request to be added by the moderators

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,960
and and showcase their own events

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,880
and start using the tool so really good

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,280
feature that came purely from community

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
requests and via rachel as the community

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,960
liaison

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,480
speaking of which there's also a new

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
contributor guide

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
feature available on drupal.org and i

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
want to give a particular thank you to

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,200
jennifer hodgton

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
and the documentation contributors

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
who've been deeply involved

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,000
in this process um let's see

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
rachel why don't you talk about this one

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,480
again just a little bit in terms of what

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,559
it is

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
and the basic structure of how it goes

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,440
we'll have to move relatively quickly

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,559
but um so way back when we started to

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
look at the whole

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,640
slash community area one of the things

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,679
that i found frustrating

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
was um

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
the getting involved guide is great it's

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,039
got lots of content but it's so hard to

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,640
find what you want

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,080
very hard very hard and

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
so a whole team of us including jennifer

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,120
hodgdon

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,280
and lots of other people spend a bit of

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,120
time going well we could reorganize and

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,039
all this type of stuff and in the end

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,240
we said no we should make a really big

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,919
change

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,240
so what we said is we should create

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,799
a model of the community we should data

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,360
model who the community is

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,960
and which is a you know sort of a

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
radical thing to do with a piece of

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
software that's

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,559
intentionally built to data model

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,240
things so we

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,320
created three content types we want a

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,559
better description

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,480
there's a lot of tasks that happen in

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,120
drupal things that people do to make the

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
community

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,880
work they could be testing

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
a patch they could be creating a patch

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,080
they could be

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,720
updating an out-of-date patch although

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,919
of course we won't need to do that soon

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,000
um etc

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,840
could be writing lots of different

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
things it could be writing documentation

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,440
whatever so that's

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,600
task now to perform the task

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
well and to know whether you're going to

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
be able to perform it

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,520
you may or may not need one or more

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
skills

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
so we're going to have a definition of

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
different skills

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,080
yeah also each skill should tell you

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,280
how to both know if somebody has

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,400
the skill so that someone can say do i

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
have this skill

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,480
yes or no and

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,000
how to obtain that skill be that how to

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,520
use git or something

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,720
yeah or mentor a a person in drupal

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,440
then once we've got those going

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
then we will introduce contributor roles

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,400
now

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
these will be things like a mentoring

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
lead or a

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
mentor yeah so a drupal mentor would be

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,400
it

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,159
will be a contributor role which will be

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,679
made up of lots of tasks and

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,000
it will inevitably

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
have skills that you will require to

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,559
fulfill role

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,400
and because each skill now has

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,679
a definition of how to know if someone's

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,039
got it we know if someone's actually

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,799
capable of doing the

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,360
doing that role also it will

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,039
allow people to say hey these are the

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,760
skills i might learn

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,600
in the role so you can see how you're

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,400
going to move forward and how you're

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
going to

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,840
progress your drupal contributor career

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,919
through the roles that you can move on

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,400
through and each role might also

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,200
say hey you've been doing this role for

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
a while

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,280
why do you use the skills that you've

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
learned to go do these other things as

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,000
well

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,600
so we can help encourage people to

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,360
continue to grow

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,039
over time and

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,039
then eventually we'll be able to get to

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,799
the point where we can attach roles to

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,880
people so we know who's going on

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
doing things in our community we can

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
celebrate this

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:42,559
their work more etc etc also

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,559
someone can come along to our

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
role browser that's it that would seem

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,240
to contribute to grind and say

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,799
hey i've got these skills which roles

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,000
can i get involved in because my skills

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,679
will help

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,440
or look at it the other way and say i

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,799
want to learn these skills how can i get

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,080
involved in the community and learn them

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,320
on the job

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
so we're hoping that this is going to

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,120
dramatically

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,360
change how people

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,159
interact with the community side of

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,159
documentation

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,600
thank you rachel so as you can see

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,880
there's already

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,720
to um to find to browse through this

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
the existing tasks and skills that have

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
already been created

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,600
there's also a contribution opportunity

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,280
happening this week and on the friday

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,159
contribution day to help build this out

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
further

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
so you can continue to take a look at

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
what we're using as the new set of

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,039
onboarding tools for drupal contributors

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,559
now i'm going to switch into sort of the

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,159
infrastructural side

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,159
developer services side of

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,640
drupal.org and the services that we do

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
particularly packaging in drupal ci

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
um so there's a couple of things that

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,880
happened from the packaging

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,200
and composer support in packaging side

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,480
um

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,240
ryan do you want to talk a little bit

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,760
about the challenges

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,400
after drupal 8.8 and through drupal 9

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,039
in our package sure um one of the uh

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
main

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,159
things that happened in drupal 8.8 was

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,279
the goal of

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,640
making drupal uh composer ready out of

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,159
the box because we kept running into

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,559
these situations where

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,919
users would download drupal and they

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
would start using it and they would run

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
into a situation where they needed to

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,200
use composer to add a module

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,159
that had a composer dependency and their

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,799
system was broken

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,320
and it was not a great state for people

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,240
to be in so

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,400
the composer initiative got drupal

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
kind of wrangled up into a situation

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,960
where now

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,000
it is able to be uh you can you can

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,760
start with the tarball

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,039
if that's what your needs are and then

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,480
actually transition over to using

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,279
composer if that was

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,559
um what you need to do but in order to

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
make that happen we had to build the

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,679
tarball

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,480
using composer and that required us to

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,640
um

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,400
kind of rethink the way that we do our

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
packaging pipeline because uh

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
before it was sort of a lot of drupal

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,760
hooks and

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,400
um just sort of a jenkins job that uh

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,120
built the tarball out of a git repo but

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
now

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,279
uh it's no longer built out of a git

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
repo it's built assembled using composer

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
so

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,279
uh we made a lot of changes to it uh

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,880
it's nice now because now we have a

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,559
like a nice you know this step happens

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,919
and this step happens and then this

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,919
stuff happens

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,279
it allows us to kind of see what's going

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
on behind the scenes in

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,200
in our ci infrastructure and so that'll

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
that'll be something we can continue to

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
add to and continue to make

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,080
changes to the way that drupal core

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,720
itself is built

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
um because you know the repo is no

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
longer the product

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,039
it's you know the product is something

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,000
that gets built out of the repo

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,279
uh and so that was you know uh kind of

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,960
the main thing that we

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,520
uh did there to um

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,840
yeah and this has this has other sort of

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
follow-on impacts so michael for example

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
um

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,279
maybe you can talk about this a little

00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
bit even though it's kind of behind the

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,679
scenes

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
the security team and the core

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,520
maintainers have a sort of packaging

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
process that occurs for security

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,320
releases

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,279
and this whole change affected that too

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,279
do you want to

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,039
just maybe introduce people to why that

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,960
is why it is that it has its own process

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,960
for security releases depending on the

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,720
release we sometimes actually do the git

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,360
commits to a private repo

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
24 hours before the release so that at

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,640
the time we're doing the

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:30,000
actual releases we're all ready to go um

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,240
and so you know this pipelining work

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,440
that that ryan's been a lot of work on

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,279
uh is

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
really critical making sure security

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,840
releases happen smoothly and efficiently

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
uh and in the past we spent a lot of

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,679
time waiting for packaging to run

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,679
um and you know this is now getting

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,440
faster

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,080
awesome okay so let's go on jess i see

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
your note

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,760
jessa from the core team is in in the

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
chat and was deeply involved in this

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
process as well

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,000
i'm not totally sure how much time we

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
have to keep going deeper but let's see

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
when we get to the end

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
maybe we can invite jess or others up on

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,919
stage ryan back to you about drupal ci

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,960
drupal ci has also had some recent

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,880
changes um having to do with testing for

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,080
getting modules ready for drupal yeah so

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,080
you want to talk through those well a

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,159
long time ago drupal ci had a

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
conundrum on how to figure out how to

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,279
get all of the dependencies that a

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
project needed to test itself

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,720
particularly for contrib and the way

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,799
that we solved that it was like well

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
let's use composer to get all of these

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,480
dependencies in now that we have the

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,039
composer facade and that worked for a

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,000
while

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,960
except when it came to when drupal 9 was

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,399
released

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,640
what we would normally do is clone

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,840
drupal core and then require the module

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,279
into drupal core

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,279
well the problem is if you're trying to

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,120
work on a module that's d8 compatible

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,960
and not yet compatible with drupal 9 it

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
was broken it wouldn't allow you to do

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,320
that

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,840
and so it required maintainers to like

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,360
commit a patch saying they were

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,039
drupal 9 compatible even when they

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,480
weren't and they were just working on it

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,039
and so we've inverted the build to um

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,320
no longer do that to use use techniques

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,080
we learned in the packaging pipeline

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,000
process honestly to where we

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,360
get clone the repo first then we apply

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
patches and then we figure out whether

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,399
or not it needs to come from packages or

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,360
whether it needs to come from

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,880
um the git clone itself and so that that

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
helped things so that we're not now able

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
to just

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,200
uh test any sort of patches that we want

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
to uh this also

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
re-enabled uh feature branch testing on

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,559
drupal.org so if you're running feature

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,399
branches and you have a branch named

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,720
uh issue number dash something something

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,960
something it can also be tested

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,399
and also laid the groundwork for the

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,919
merge request feature

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,919
um when that becomes widely available to

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
be able to test merge requests

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
um and you know we're we're in the

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,919
throes of

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,919
reevaluating how drupal ci handles the

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,279
environment stage which is basically

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,799
where it takes the doctor containers and

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,919
says use this version of php and this

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,600
version of my sequel

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,720
and we're trying to expand that out so

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,240
the community has the ability to um

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
build their own environments because we

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
want things like uh

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,360
the search api module to be able to

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,600
stand up a solar container

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,039
and so drupal ci right now and i'm super

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,880
excited about it we're trans we're going

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,240
to transition towards using kubernetes

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,360
as our back end to

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
uh run all of our our testing on and

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
uh so that's that's where we're at right

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,120
now

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,960
um and then a bit awesome yeah and it's

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,840
and it's gonna be a big project for sure

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,600
and the merge request talk is a nice

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,880
uh little segue into an upcoming topic

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,559
let's see here here we go so um

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,159
issue forks and merge requests are

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,520
something that we've been

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,240
super super excited about um for a long

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,480
time this has

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,399
been a big deal and for those of you

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,520
listening i don't know if you

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,000
saw my tweet about this but both issue

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,799
forks

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,880
and merge requests mobile on drupal.org

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,440
beta group of projects that have opted

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,880
in so it is working today it was working

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,480
as of monday in fact

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,159
so we'll talk about this in a little bit

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,279
more detail um

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
i'm going to go through a couple of

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,480
these slides and then hand off to neil

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
who i think is going to be able to do a

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
short demo for us

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,600
to talk about kind of the component

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
parts in the drupal space

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,919
we think of an issue as a single

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,240
centralized place to have a discussion

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,840
about a problem to be solved in drupal

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,520
and part of the reason that we've built

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
some custom tooling around the issue

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
fork and merge request feature

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
is because we want to maintain that

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,279
single threaded conversation about the

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,120
solution

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,880
rather than having forks of forks and

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
forks and all the comments happening in

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,200
those other places

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,279
where we can't see them the issue fork

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
is literally that kind of code workspace

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,559
that you work from

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,320
in the sidebar of an issue on drupal.org

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,559
where it's enabled you can create

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,880
this new issue fork as your workspace

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,480
and you can use the gitlab web ide or

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
inline editing tools to actually

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,000
directly make your changes there

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,600
without having to clone it down use

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
command line and that kind of stuff

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,760
and of course the merge request is the

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
feature within gitlab the pull request

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,559
feature

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,960
that lets you request that your changes

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,760
be pulled back in by the maintainer

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,919
um so uh you know as you can see this is

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,840
what the repository on the back end

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
uh sort of looks like in the gitlab

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
interface

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
um this is what a merge request in

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,840
general uh

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,360
sort of looks like um but um let's take

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,600
a look at some of these stats

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,120
so when i when i said earlier that

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,559
issues on drupal.org are usually

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,720
collaborative that there's multiple

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,120
people working on one solution

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,840
instead of a fragmented bunch of several

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,799
solutions made the best one win

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,039
neil pulled these averages and in drupal

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,880
core there's an average of 5.3 people

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,279
involved in finding the solution for

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,360
any issue in the oliveira theme the

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,840
average was 4.3 people

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
so

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
do we have a frozen tim i think we have

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,679
a frozen gym

00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,679
we do

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,159
neil you want to jump in and do a demo

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,640
yeah uh

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:23,840
let's see yeah i'll just go to demo

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:28,240
um let's share our screen

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,480
okay uh so i have an issue open that

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,279
i actually opened about a year ago

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,039
apparently

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,600
uh and it has a simple fix that i've

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,360
already

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,320
uh gotten together uh it's basically

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,200
uh if you were in the uh lizzie wake

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,399
editor

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,640
we have the hr tags wouldn't show up but

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:52,480
now they are

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
uh for some reason margins helped

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,880
so every issue in the about 50 probably

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
by the time

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,240
i go through the next round of enabling

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,720
beta projects uh

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
there's an issue anyone can request that

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,240
at uh

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,600
they can go to any issue and

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,919
fork it and that created that copy of

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,360
the repository there

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,559
so i'll do the command line way today

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,559
i can do get remote add and

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,240
uh the url

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,799
and a fetch from there

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,840
let's see

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,600
i copied that wrong

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
so i use the uh

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,039
web version since it's probably just a

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,279
copy

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
thing

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,840
so yeah you can create a branch right

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,840
away from here

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:17,520
and uh since we're in the

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,560
interface we'll update it via the

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,520
via get lab and

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,800
let's see that is which file is this

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,240
parcels common basic elements

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,520
uh this is our theme for drupal.org

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,839
that we're updating basic

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,839
elements

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,240
and uh let's do the regular inline

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,119
editing uh the web id is a little bit

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,639
heavier in my

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,760
laptop's uh working on things

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,520
uh 190 hr

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,520
height 1px replace that

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,520
version uh one

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:16,000
yeah zero

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:19,119
and connect those

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,880
uh so uh there is

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,800
uh in the sidebar of all these and

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,200
actually at the top uh link back to the

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
issue

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,839
let's see

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,760
this

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:48,640
there's the link to the issue

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,640
uh so you see that uh

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:58,720
the uh the branch is there

00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:01,920
we can compare it see what we committed

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,599
get that out of the way uh

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,599
and create a merge request

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,720
and i will go ahead and put the uh

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
message in the title so this is uh

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,400
they'll pre-fill it with the commit

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
message

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,760
let's make the merge request

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,680
so the merge request is open and the

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,680
issue page will have updated as well

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,320
so i opened merge quest one if there's

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,839
more activity on here

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
let's see

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,839
oh there we go uh i hadn't updated that

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,320
so uh there is a comment

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,280
uh and all of the immerse request

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,320
activity will be

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,640
uh piled up in the issue uh along with

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,760
the

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,440
comments uh there and since i'm the main

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,560
uh one of the maintainers here

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,160
and uh i i've reviewed it

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,000
i can go and say it's good it's just one

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,640
line of code

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,640
in merchant

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,599
so yeah all of that's working today uh

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,240
we're working on adding testing right

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,079
now

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,760
and uh kind of cleaning up any rough

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,359
edges of the ui that

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,359
are people testing this find

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,960
awesome thank you neil so as you can see

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
an end-to-end run

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,560
of a complete issue fork and merge

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,119
request

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
uh demo experience again available for

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,400
beta projects and hopefully to be

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,280
expanded to a lot more projects very

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
soon

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
um we're not too far away from being

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,880
able to enable it for

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,359
kind of all contrib projects and getting

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,760
it ready to test with a specific first

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,240
test issue for drupal core so that we

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,240
can enable it there as well

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,680
i do see a question that i think is is

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,839
relevant so i'll take it now um

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,880
the uh question is about the drupal

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,640
spoons initiative

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
how we feel about the initiative

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,079
potential fracturing of the contrib

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
issue tracking environment and whether

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,040
we have a stance whether someone should

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,440
or should not use it

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,440
so yeah so um i've had several

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,359
conversations with moshe about this

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
um and you've seen i think several blog

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,320
posts about it

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,680
my understanding and if moshe is here

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,520
watching the session he can certainly

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,359
chime in and chat as well

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,960
is that the um uh

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,640
the drupal spoons initiative is about

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,920
pushing the boundaries of how the drupal

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,760
community collaborates

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,440
and trying to use different

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,720
off-the-shelf tools

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,440
that um uh to see okay

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,000
could we run a drupal core issue using

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,839
just

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
built-in git lab issues rather than

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,640
using custom drupal.org issues

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
could we use gitlab ci rather than

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,680
drupal ci

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,359
and it's a way to experiment with that

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,280
and for maintainers who are sort of

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,400
long-time contributors to the drupal

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,520
project

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,839
who want to experience and experiment

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,680
with that kind of contribution activity

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,839
they can certainly do that

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,839
they're welcome to do that but it's up

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,680
to the ultimate goal

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,119
even from the drupal spoon side in my

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,119
conversations with mosh

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,240
is not to try and move everybody off of

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,640
drupal.org host

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,880
tools it's to see if they can prove a

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,839
successful experiment

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,599
and then advocate for that to be adopted

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,880
back to drupal.org

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,119
so for example um if if

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
if at some point they prove that that

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,280
get lab issues wind up working better in

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,920
some way maybe we adopt that or enable

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,800
that

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
or if um as it seems like more likely

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,560
right now

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,400
if if the gitlab ci system uh can

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,520
provide some orchestration tools that we

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
could take advantage

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,760
of as part of drupal ci perhaps we might

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,599
adopt some of that as well

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,800
so that's kind of the way that we

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,480
currently sort of

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
perceive that initiative and how that's

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,680
working

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,319
um so i hope that answer answered the

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,920
question um

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,280
going to keep running oh if you want to

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,680
learn more about what's next you can

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,839
follow along and get that code.org

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,520
issue and again we'll be updating folks

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,599
in our regular engineering

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,280
communications blog posts and things

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,560
like that as this continues

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,119
because we know this is very exciting

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,800
for the community as a whole

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,640
i did want to talk super briefly about

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,839
the drupal steward program

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,599
i'm going to go through this quickly

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,040
because we're also talking about it in

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,359
the security team

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,800
panel which immediately follows this one

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,800
so the drupal steward program

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,319
is a program from the drupal association

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,280
to provide

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,560
network level mitigation basically a waf

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,680
service

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,800
where the da and some of our partners

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,760
can protect

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,440
drupal sites from vulnerabilities it

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,880
applies only to the kind of highly

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,079
critical mass exploitable

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,680
vulnerabilities

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,480
so sa core o2 the drupal gebin 2 as it's

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
colloquial

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
colloquial known would be the kind of

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,480
thing that could have been protected

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,880
with this

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,720
so the idea would be that people can

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,040
sign up for this program

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,000
um they would get alerted in the form of

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,800
the psa

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,440
if a upcoming release was going to be

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,839
covered

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,680
with this layer of protection um and

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,440
then they would have this network level

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,000
mitigation so that they can choose at

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
their own

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,920
time and their own pace when to actually

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
install

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,800
that update that security patch um so

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,560
again we'll talk about this a little bit

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,079
more in the security session

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,000
one of the really exciting things about

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,920
this program is it is

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,839
if you followed some of the da sessions

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,839
earlier it is part of

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,520
revenue diversification for the drupal

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,319
association and for supporting the

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,480
security team

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,319
so it does cost a little bit extra it's

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,599
a service we have to run it's not just

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
code

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,680
but we think that by coming together

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,280
with those features that's going to

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,119
to really help us out and there will be

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
limitations it can't apply to every type

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,760
of vulnerability some things just can't

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,560
be protected

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,800
with a network level mitigation we do

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,880
have some partners joining us

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,920
uh on the platform side away and

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,359
pantheon

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,720
protecting their platforms we're going

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,680
to work with agency partners in the

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,920
supporting program

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
partner program and we have a community

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,839
tier partner to help us operate the

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,839
drupal association side that anybody

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:33,599
full animals

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,440
yep exactly so we have about three

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,200
minutes left so i know this is going to

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,160
be tricky and i've seen some questions

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,680
there so

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,280
um this is about the future of

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,119
drupal.org i'm going to do a single

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,160
slide that talks about a lot of things

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,440
that are coming so

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,520
there's going to be more work on the

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,200
collaboration tools um further

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,319
enhancements to basically to how this

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
merge request

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,720
stuff works we're going to revisit the

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,720
idea of federated login

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,319
the notion of having other services that

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,520
can log in using your drupal.org

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,280
identity

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,280
we're going to be updating the

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,319
contribution recognition algorithm

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,359
based on directives from the recognition

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,920
committee

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,160
and we are going to be working on

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,000
updates for drupal.org itself to bring

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,280
drupal.org to drupal 9.

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,920
that's where i'd like to spend our last

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,839
couple minutes really quickly we're also

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,599
collaborating with the core team

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,119
we want to collaborate continue to

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,920
collaborate on the auto updates

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,440
initiative

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,960
we were heavily involved in the first

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,480
phase of that um

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
there's a project messaging in core

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,400
initiative that we've also been involved

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,640
in

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,560
some ideas about a telemetry initiative

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,240
and of course with drupal 10 coming

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,280
in now less than two years we've got to

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
do this usual

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,880
infrastructural work to support this new

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,760
um

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
to support the new release so very

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,880
briefly

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,480
because we're going to be low on time

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,680
maybe you know ryan i'll hand it to you

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,119
a little bit to talk about what's

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,119
involved in getting

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,160
drupal's infrastructure ready to run

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,200
drupal.org

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,160
on well there's what's directly involved

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
and then there's what that

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,359
what makes sense to go along with this

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,680
um what i mentioned

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,680
in the chat was that this is basically

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,000
an excuse to modernize how we're doing

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,640
things

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,599
a bit because we're not going to be able

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,760
to just jump

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,680
everything forward because that's just

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,040
not how development works

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,119
so this is a good excuse to

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,359
containerize some things so we can more

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,760
easily run multiple versions of php

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,160
without doing the slotted php dance that

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,079
we

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,280
actually currently do because we're

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,079
already running multiple

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,839
versions of php to support things like

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,440
um the composer facade and

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,400
um things that require a newer version

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,920
of php from a cli perspective

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,359
but it's a very good

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,800
opportunity to just do

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:54,079
this in a more modular more

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,800
modern and uh more workable way

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,400
for future development so from my

00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,440
perspective it's exciting because i get

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,359
to

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,599
actually take an old-school

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,119
infrastructure that is probably the

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,880
one of the oldest school infrastructures

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,040
i routinely work on

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,920
and convert it into a more modern

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,160
workflow

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,760
replace the nfs cluster i built when i

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,200
was in college which is nice

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,680
it's very exciting um and

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,200
just kind of get things on a more

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,880
containerized workflow

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,480
possibly uh deploying uh karates at the

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,800
oregon state open source lab which is

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,200
our hosting partner um possibly doing

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,040
some

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,480
mixed hosting it's unclear what we are

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,200
actually going to be doing

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,090
there except that we are definitely

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,760
going to be

00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,640
[Music]

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,240
just allowing us to have the very

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,680
specific requirements

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,839
that each site needs more separated

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,839
and then locked down from each other

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
from a from kind of a higher level point

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,000
of view i know we're going slightly

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,359
over so thank you for bearing with us

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,319
we're going to have to jump in just a

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,839
second

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,920
but the what we'd like to do for say

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,160
drupal.org itself which is such a large

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,560
site that has so many components

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,760
is we're talking about using our cdn

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,079
layer to direct

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
traffic primarily to the existing drupal

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,079
7 site but then

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,720
as we migrate to a drupal 9 site

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,720
redirect

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,720
traffic to those sections as they come

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,240
online so that as we have upgraded

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,280
individual sections we can make them

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,359
available

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,599
instead of waiting to go all at once um

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,119
just uh to answer our quick questions

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,040
and then wrap things up

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,960
the community can help by taking a look

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,720
at some of the community modules

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,400
that are used on drupal.org and making

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,920
sure that they're updated and working

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,280
with drupal mine that would be a really

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,040
good way to help

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,640
is to make sure things are ported over

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,680
there's a number of modules we use

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,720
just like everything else and yes all of

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,119
the

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,880
drupal.org subsites are in fact managed

00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,359
by the drupal association engineering

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,800
team

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,800
there's no specific leads because

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,599
there's really only four full-time staff

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,119
plus

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,640
volunteers and and contractors um so

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,880
we jump around a uh site all right

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,920
um i'm afraid we have to go ahead and be

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,119
self-contained

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,000
uh and yeah chase us down on drupal

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,960
slack

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,920
and let us know what you're good at uh

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,960
if you'd like to help

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,760
and see if there's a match with

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,760
what we could use

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,680
yeah that would be great and and we'll

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,720
be around on the contribution day for

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,559
sure

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,000
so i'm afraid we have to close it here

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,000
because some of us need to go to the
