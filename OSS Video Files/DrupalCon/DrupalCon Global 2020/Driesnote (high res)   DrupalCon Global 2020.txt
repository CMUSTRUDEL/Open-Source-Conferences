awesome I think you should be able to

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,599
see my screen now for those that don't

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:12,480
know me I'm Greece I started the project

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,960
and I'm still des predict Li today you

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,859
can find me online as you can see here

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,500
we have a lot to cover today the main

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,230
topics for today are the release of

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,449
Drupal 9 and then I'm going to talk a

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,650
lot about Drupal 10 and what we're going

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:35,399
to focus on next but before we get

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,710
started I wanted to recognize that

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,680
there's a lot going on in the world

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,750
right now and to start I wanted to

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,200
extend my sympathies for everyone

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,450
impacted by Kovach 19 this has been hard

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,090
this has been hard for many including

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,289
the Drupal Association as Heather talked

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,910
about for those in the black community

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,800
we know that you carry an extra burden

00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,690
and I want to be clear that I and the

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,630
Drupal community stand in solidarity

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,330
with you the need for increased

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,939
diversity and inclusion was a major

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,369
theme at last year's Drupal con and you

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,619
may remember this light where I talked

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,350
about why diversity and inclusion

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,810
inclusion is so important not only is it

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,140
the ethical right thing to do but it

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,240
also improves innovation and creativity

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,909
and collaboration as a project we are

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,549
committed to making Drupal a more

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,520
diverse and inclusive place for black

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,790
people and other people of color so that

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,920
we can all drive at this year's Drupal

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,290
con we actually have our most diverse

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,689
lineup of speakers ever which is

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,399
something that I'm very proud of and we

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,210
will continue to make this a priority

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,030
going forward I feel responsible you

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,700
know as as Drees as an individual but

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,020
also as a project lead of Drupal to talk

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,850
about diversity equity and inclusion but

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,789
also feel like we need to make

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,649
meaningful changes and concrete actions

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,720
it's not enough to just talk about these

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,390
things so there's a few things that

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,630
we're doing

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,270
in addition to what Heather just talked

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,970
about one of the things that we're doing

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,130
is we're reviving the values and

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,740
principles committee and we're going to

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,130
review our values and principles through

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,290
a lens of anti racism our community

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,860
working group and community health the

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,880
team is already in process of reviewing

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,150
our code of conduct to make sure you

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,280
know to update our anti harassment

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,410
language and things like that to make it

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,530
very clear that we do not tolerate

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,440
discrimination harassment and racism in

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,590
our community we will continue to track

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,080
and publish diversity data so we can

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,000
hold ourselves accountable I will

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,489
personally make a donation to black

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,180
girls code and in addition Acquia my

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:10,870
company is donating $5 to black girls

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,970
code for everyone that joins our booth

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,090
and clicks their register interest

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,549
button and I know this is just the start

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,810
I know this is not enough but we will

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:29,829
continue to make progress and work on

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:33,160
this until we see true racial justice so

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:35,860
I wanted to thank you and thank everyone

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,019
that's you know working with us that's

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,350
helping us work through these crises

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,299
both kovin 19 as well as the financial

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:47,700
challenges of the Drupal Association as

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:49,660
well as topics like racial injustice

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,329
obviously I would have preferred to meet

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,430
in person but I'm still very happy that

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,090
we were able to you know pull off this

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,269
virtual conference and able to meet sort

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,930
of virtually and while that does feel

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,829
different you know still feels really

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,600
good that we are together now here

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,500
virtually and it feels really good

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,150
actually knowing you know all of the

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,720
things that we do I truly believe that

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,940
Drupal is in a very unique position

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,400
where we can have a real impact if you

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,510
think about some of the side effects of

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,390
of what is happening is

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,030
you know in times of financial crisis

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,370
many organizations have to do more with

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,700
less and when you have to do more with

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,040
less budgets are cut and frankly open

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,160
source and Drupal become more relevant

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:48,950
we've seen this in all of the previous

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:51,350
financial crises but also because

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,540
retails and stores are closed many

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,000
organizations are actually going to an

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,830
accelerated digital transformation where

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,110
they have to move more of their business

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,980
online and again this is something that

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,190
makes Drupal even more relevant today

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,760
and so you know on a on a positive note

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,920
I would say we have some other exciting

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,500
news obviously and that is that last

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,750
month we released Drupal 9 and we

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,020
released it on time as we said we with

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,940
and maybe a little unconventional this

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,730
time around but we still found an

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,360
appropriate way to celebrate the release

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,580
of Drupal 9 with people all around the

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,840
world and have a very quick video of

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,840
that that I would like to show you

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:53,330
[Music]

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,750
one nextiva's way to slip bursting with

00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:16,070
excitement

00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:16,070
[Music]

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,939
isn't it awesome I just love how much

00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,310
progress we've made in the last four and

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,129
a half years and how we were able to to

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,469
celebrate this there's so much great

00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:34,050
things that we did just to give you a

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,599
few quick examples obviously throughout

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,900
the drupe online release cycle we added

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,810
media management which is great because

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,150
it gave us a completely new way of

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,430
managing images and videos and it's a

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,490
lot more user-friendly and it was ever

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,259
bidden before we also worked on a new

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,629
way to create layouts and to manage

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,580
layouts with the layout builder and

00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:00,389
really dramatically improved page

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,029
building in drupal which is awesome we

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,669
made amazing progress through our API

00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:08,879
first initiative which is all about it

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,919
advancing drupal's web services report

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,529
to help build headless or decoupled

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,509
applications and you can see you know

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:18,210
some pretty famous organizations in the

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,759
world have begun using this to build you

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,939
know native apps and to you know push

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:27,569
content in all sorts of devices and

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:30,539
modalities and maybe best of all and

00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:33,599
this one I'm particularly proud of is

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:38,120
that we delivered on our promise to make

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,819
Drupal 9 the easiest update or upgrades

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,439
and in the recent history of Drupal just

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,509
looking at some of the stats you know a

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,330
third of all of the modules are actually

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,699
already Drupal 9 which is record

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,189
breaking and then another third of all

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,469
of the modules there's only one line of

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:58,259
change required to make them fully

00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:00,689
Drupal 9 ready so hopefully we can make

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,599
some progress on those this week and so

00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:06,449
all in all Drupal 9 has the easiest

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,479
upgrade path in the last 15 years of

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,610
Drupal and maybe longer which is awesome

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,180
and our users love it like if you go and

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,310
Twitter

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,539
you see people tweet about it every day

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,460
here's just a handful of these tweets

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,460
where people say how smooth are not easy

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,519
a great pad is I personally upgraded my

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,590
own site I know that's a simple site but

00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,020
it took no more than 20 minutes

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,450
upgrade my personal blog from Drupal 8

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,720
to Drupal 9 so that was a very special

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,300
feeling to be able to do that so all in

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,610
all it's difficult to highlight

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,980
everything but there's just so much that

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,140
we've accomplished and so I think it's

00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,600
fair to say that we really climbed a

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,110
mountain together and made progress on

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,640
each of these four strategic tracks

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,970
which I think has been fantastic if you

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,410
look at that through the lens of data

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,160
you have data points like this where we

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,070
had 55 bug fix releases of 9 major

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,590
releases 35 alphas betas and release

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,440
candidates in 24 security releases

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,090
that's a lot of work for the core

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,540
committers and the release management

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:18,420
team so big kudos to them for you know

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,600
doing this like no like clockwork as a

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,000
heartbeat for the project we also have a

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,000
new innovation model where new features

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,790
can enter Drupal core as experimental

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,090
and can then sort of graduate to become

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,940
stable features and we had 13 major

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,340
features go through this process which i

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,740
think is a great testament to this new

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:44,720
innovation model and how well that's

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:49,140
been working in total over 4,500

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,950
individuals contributed to Drupal 9 and

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:56,490
you know over 760 organizations

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,470
contributed to Drupal 9 which is really

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,720
hard to believe and it's even more

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,000
impressive if you look at the names on a

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,790
slide there's just so many names of

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,330
people that helped to make this happen

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,430
it's really kind of amazing to think

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,850
about that and then of course a lot of

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,520
these people have been supported by

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,490
organizations so thank you all for

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,320
contributing to Drupal 9 it's a

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,230
fantastic release I think it's maybe the

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,240
most progress we've made in a long time

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,940
and I really think it will change the

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,240
perspective that the world has on Drupal

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,670
because you know we made rupal a lot

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,200
easier to use and a lot easier to

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,350
maintain which is some of the feedback

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,060
or criticism that people have so I think

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,340
it's a fantastic accomplishment

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,920
and I really thank you for contributing

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,740
and making that happen just as a quick

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,680
reminder if you are on Drupal 8 still

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,540
you have about I think 16 months or so

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,090
to upgrade on some quick math I hope

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,920
that's right and if you're on Drupal 7

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,350
you actually have more time which may

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,110
sound a little counterintuitive but you

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,670
have more than two years before Drupal 7

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,950
its end of life that's something that

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,940
we've recently changed we extended it by

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,680
a year and after that actually have

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,930
commercially extended support as well so

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,210
if you're on seven we encourage you to

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,810
upgrade but if you're not ready to

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,430
upgrade you know you can stay on Drupal

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,130
seven it is well maintained and

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,220
supported with bug fix and security

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,160
releases so that's a little bit about

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,870
Drupal 9 and so now I really want to

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,600
spend most of the rest of the

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,970
presentation talking about it what we're

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,130
going to do next what are some of the

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,460
new things that we're gonna do as we

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,430
think about Drupal 10 now before I dive

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,820
in I wanted to share a few quick things

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,560
one is that we learned from Drupal AIDS

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,180
that we actually had too many

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,300
initiatives if you remember that

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,220
mountain slides there is more than 15

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,930
initiatives on that mountain and in fact

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,050
not all of the initiatives were on that

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,970
mountain so that was a lot and we didn't

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,490
finish them all despite a lot of great

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,620
progress the other thing that we know

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,620
already is that we won't have the same

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,140
amount of time to build Drupal 10 then

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,840
we had for building Drupal 9 and I'll

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,160
come back to that in a minute here to

00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,950
explain that a little bit more but with

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,150
these two things in mind my goal for

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,850
today is to propose five initiatives for

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,310
Drupal 10 and I know that sounds like a

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,230
lot less and it is but it allows us to

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,110
focus and allows us to make great

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,270
progress now when I think about five

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,430
initiatives I want to make sure that

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,220
these initiatives are well balanced

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,580
right and what I mean by that is that we

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,330
need to balance both technical debt and

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,610
innovation we need to consider different

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,899
stakeholders or personas for example we

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,689
need to think about

00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,220
what developers want but we also need to

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,230
think about what site builders and

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,040
content creators want and even sellers

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,230
people involved with convincing

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,269
potential customers or users of using

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,720
Drupal going forward we also need to

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,249
balance a long term and short term goals

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,679
which can be hard and then last but not

00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:22,619
least we need to work towards a

00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,259
strategic vision that makes it really

00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:27,839
really clear to individuals and

00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,029
organizations as to why they should

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,949
adopt Drupal like it should be obvious

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,249
if you're doing this kind of work you

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:37,499
should use Drupal to be really

00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:40,170
differentiated compared to other

00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:43,679
solutions now the way I want to go about

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,860
this today is in two steps in step one

00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,769
is to make a list of all of the

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,920
important initiatives to consider so I'm

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:56,339
gonna make a list maybe 20 to 25

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,529
potential initiatives and then we're

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,769
gonna have the heart you know chore I

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,569
guess of selecting just five and that

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,660
will be hard but we're gonna try and

00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:08,850
make sure that they're well balanced all

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,499
right so that's the plan and so let's

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,709
start with making the list of

00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:15,480
initiatives to consider and so the way I

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:18,410
think about this there's sort of four

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,179
buckets of initiatives to consider one

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,670
are the initiatives or the things that

00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:27,269
are mandatory because they're security

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,899
related to are things that we've already

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,579
started that are still pretty awesome

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,860
that people still want but that we

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:39,089
haven't finished and so things that we

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,149
want to finish three are things that

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,160
existing users are asking us for things

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,679
that they want to see in future versions

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,629
of Drupal and last the fourth bucket

00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,290
it's things that we know we need to do

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:55,769
to attract new users to Drupal and to

00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:59,730
stay relevant in the long term so things

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:02,160
that users are asking us for are them to

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,139
be a little bit more short-term whereas

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,070
things that will attract new users and

00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,410
that make people feel confident about

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,910
picking Drupal for you know to build

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,760
their sites for the next you know

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,590
decades tend to be a little bit more

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,350
longer-term so let's go through these

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,510
four buckets and let's start with the

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,180
things that we need to do because we

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,370
feel they're mandatory to do and a lot

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,120
of that comes down to keeping Drupal

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,730
secure as you know Drupal depends on a

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,010
lot of third-party components and each

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,080
of these components have an end-of-life

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,080
if you put that in a timeline like this

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,600
you can see some of the components or

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,120
the dependencies that Drupal has and for

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,040
some we already know when they're end of

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,140
life and then for others we know there

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,630
is a new version either there is a

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,670
version already or we know a version is

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,710
you know a new version is eminence but

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,870
they haven't really communicated their

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,700
end of life but the point is each of

00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,950
these components that we need to track

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,940
them and manage their end of life and in

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,630
this case symphony for and ckeditor for

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:10,240
we know their end of life at the end of

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:13,060
2023 and really what that does it forces

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,850
us to end of life Drupal 9 as well

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,330
right and so what we need to do is we

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,340
need to release a new version of Drupal

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,340
well before these are end-of-life

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,860
because we want to give our users you

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,810
know all of the users of Drupal 9 time

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,090
to upgrade their site before these

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,580
components are end-of-life and so really

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,760
what that means is that we're targeting

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:43,420
the release of Drupal 10 to be around

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:45,640
June of 2022 now some of you may you

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,370
know panic a little bit or be afraid

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,650
because that is actually you know like

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,260
two years away or even a little bit less

00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,390
than two years away and you know

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,240
obviously there will be an upgrade from

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:02,620
Drupal 9 to Drupal 10 but let's not

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,439
forget we made upgrades easy and we will

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,170
continue to make upgrades easy just like

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,910
we did from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 and in

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,040
fact there's a lot of things that we've

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,579
learned from that that will allow us to

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,130
make it even smoother so don't panic the

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,910
upgrade from Drupal 9 to drip Alton

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,850
should be easy

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,069
now what that means for those of you

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,230
that are contributing to Drupal 10 or

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:31,190
throughout the Drupal 9 development

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,740
cycle is that actually Drupal 9.3 alpha

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,830
they serve the last opportunity to

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,470
introduce new features or replace

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,020
existing features or API because we do

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,590
need some time to prepare for Drupal 10

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,840
and to remove deprecated code for

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,490
example so really what that means is

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,670
that we don't have a whole lot of time

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,740
for innovation for implementing new

00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:58,010
features and capabilities in fact if you

00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,830
compare that the Drupal 9 we have less

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,590
than two years compared to 4.5 years and

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,350
we only have three minor releases that

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,890
we can use to innovate you know compared

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,240
to eight minor releases in Drupal 9 so

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:15,020
that's just something to keep in mind

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,780
and another reason why five initiatives

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,970
for drupal 10 seems you know sufficient

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,440
anyway with all of that set the first

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,540
initiative that i think we should

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,320
consider and we may not have a choice

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,000
here is what I've called the drupal 10

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,610
readiness initiative which is really all

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,740
about making sure that the dependencies

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,380
or the components that we use are

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,480
properly managed and that we have you

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,220
know proper security coverage for all of

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,650
them now if you go into a little bit

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,840
more detail you can see there's a long

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,250
list of these initiatives here and for

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,130
each of them we need to figure out what

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,140
to do often it's just an upgrade but in

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,110
some cases we need to think about it do

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,330
we stick with that you know components

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,070
or do we actually want to change it to

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,250
something else like for example CK

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:07,850
editor for CK editor 5 is a major

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,530
rewrite with lots of API changes so you

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,480
know we need to decide do you want to go

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:15,530
with CK editor 5 or is this a good time

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,230
to maybe reconsider our options now some

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,960
of these initiatives and these upgrades

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,090
I should say of components are actually

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,860
very good right like some of them

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,870
actually give us new capabilities new

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,320
API is new innovation so it's not just

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,930
maintenance work we actually in some of

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,570
the cases get real benefits and

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:38,150
user benefits too from these initiatives

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,650
and you know ckeditor would be a great

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,170
example because they've made a lot of

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,000
improvements and they allow like

00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,340
collaborative editing and these kinds of

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,760
things with future versions of seek

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,130
editor as you can see the total effort

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,990
for all of this is large I mean some of

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,680
them are extra large on their own but

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,900
then if you add up everything it is kind

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,390
of a large undertaking to get ready for

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,940
Drupal 10 and this is not even

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,590
everything that we have to do so that's

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,900
really the first initiative that I

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,210
believe we should consider and so I'm

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,090
adding it here in the bucket of things

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,730
that are mandatory so with that let's

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:19,490
move on to the next bucket which is

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,310
things that we've already started but

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,950
not finished and there's actually a lot

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,900
of amazing things that we've started but

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,990
not entirely finished and so one example

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,360
is the media initiative which gives us

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,000
this new media library to help manage

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,580
images and videos now it actually ships

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,890
with Drupal 9 it's stable when it ships

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,520
with Drupal 9 and we encourage people to

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,150
use it

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,760
however it's not enabled by default so

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,520
if you install Drupal it's not part of

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,860
the out-of-the-box experience now we

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,470
don't love that because it's such a

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,150
great feature for you know beginners and

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,880
and you know people that are less

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,770
technical they really benefit from this

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,990
and so what we want to do is we want to

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,630
finish this right we want to add some of

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,920
the things that are missing like

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,900
integration with some parts of Drupal

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,350
some usability and accessibility

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,530
improvements and things like that in the

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,140
same boat is the layout builder again it

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,720
is stable it ships with Drupal 9 we

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,780
encourage people to use it but it's also

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,060
not enabled by default and that's a

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,160
shame because it's a much better

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,470
experience a lot of usability

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,930
improvements come from using the layout

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,090
builder so we need to finish it in order

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,490
to do so we need to think about

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,220
replacing the you know existing or the

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,840
old block placement UI we also have to

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,420
make some usability and accessibility

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,179
improvements and some other things as

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,969
well

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:52,059
our new admin fee the name of that theme

00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:54,639
is Claro is more or less in the same

00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,979
boat its ships with core but it's still

00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:59,079
beta so it's not stable and it's also

00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:01,109
not enabled by default and it's such an

00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,419
improvement in terms of the

00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:06,969
administrative experience also in terms

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:09,759
of accessibility that we want to enable

00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:11,889
it by default and ship it to be the you

00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,929
know default experience for everyone and

00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:15,539
so again there's a few things that we

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,739
need to finish like media integration

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,869
toolbar support and we want to make sure

00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:22,869
that the module administration page as

00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:25,239
an example looks really good so I think

00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:27,459
it's pretty close but it still needs to

00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:30,879
be finished and so what I did is I

00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:33,609
actually bundled each of these or all

00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:35,559
three of these things into one

00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,549
initiative and the goal is to push them

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,119
over the finish line

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,999
make it an out-of-the-box experience for

00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:47,349
Drupal and that will be very important

00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:48,729
because it will make Drupal a lot easier

00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:51,339
out of the box and that is very

00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:53,949
important because you may remember from

00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:56,559
my Drupal con Amsterdam presentation

00:22:53,949 --> 00:23:00,219
that we did some user research we

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,499
interviewed CMS users not just Drupal

00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:06,219
users but different users of different

00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:09,369
CMS's and we asked them what their

00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:10,959
Seraph perceptions are of the CMS over

00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:14,319
time and what we've learned is that

00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:16,839
beginners don't love Drupal to put it

00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,599
you know plainly but then as they

00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:22,239
advance as they become more experienced

00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:26,469
they start to love Drupal more and more

00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:29,379
which is why this line goes up and to

00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:33,549
the right well as interesting is that

00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:36,219
other CMS's at the exact opposite trend

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,709
line you know when we spoke to WordPress

00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:41,409
or Adobe or site code sight core users

00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:44,349
we learned that the beginners loved

00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:47,259
those platforms but then over time as

00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:50,019
the user became more of an expert they

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:52,239
start to love these platforms less and

00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:55,119
less which is kind of remarkable that

00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:57,489
Drupal trends sort of the exact opposite

00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,590
direction but it speaks to the

00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:02,019
opportunity it speaks to the opportunity

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,820
of improving the beginner experience

00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:06,730
because if we can attract more people to

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,559
Drupal give them a great experience we

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,659
should feel confident that they will

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,659
stay with the platform for a long time

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:15,730
and so that's why I believe the easy

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,679
out-of-the-box experience is an

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,690
important initiative to consider

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,129
I believe that ease of use of Drupal is

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,799
probably the number one thing that we

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:30,309
should focus on other than obviously

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:34,509
security but there is more

00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:37,450
another example is Oliveira and Oliveira

00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:39,340
is our new front end theme that we've

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,340
been building for some time now Oliveira

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,649
is not even in core yet it doesn't ship

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,759
with Drupal yet so the goal here would

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:51,669
be to get Oliveira included in a future

00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:55,570
version of Drupal 9 make it stable and

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:57,789
also enable it by default so Dan again

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,730
we leave people with a first great

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:03,429
impression and a great theme to look at

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,769
and learn from and so a new front-end

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:09,190
theme is another initiative that we

00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:12,070
should consider another one is automated

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:15,999
updates today when we do a security

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:18,999
release you know organizations that use

00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:22,179
Drupal often have to keep an expert on

00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:25,539
call to help with that security upgrades

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:28,529
and these security releases then to

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:32,499
happen around noon

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:34,360
you know Eastern Time and of course for

00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:36,610
some people depending on where you live

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,330
in the round in the world that is serve

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:44,289
an inconvenient time zone and so making

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:47,200
security updates automated would be you

00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,789
know a great win now some of you may

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,279
recall that this was actually an

00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:52,659
existing initiative which means that we

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,490
have a pretty good plan for this

00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,249
initiative and that we've actually

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,669
already made a lot of significant

00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:03,639
progress and some of that thanks to the

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,409
European Commission we really want this

00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:08,259
feature for themselves and have been

00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:11,379
funding a lot of the work on automated

00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,389
updates so let me give you a little bit

00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:16,479
more of a detailed

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:18,609
where we're at so that you can you know

00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:22,589
maybe help contribute to the initiative

00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:25,659
so if you think about automated updates

00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:28,719
you know if I simplify what needs to

00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,969
happen when an automated update or cures

00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:32,829
it's basically four things first we need

00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:35,799
to prepare for the upgrade which means

00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:38,229
Drupal needs to check that it's in a

00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:41,289
let's say healthy or clean state that

00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:44,440
nobody modified or hacked Drupal core as

00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:46,539
we say once we know that Drupal is in a

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,329
clean state we obviously have to figure

00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,889
out what needs to be updated the things

00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,989
that need to be updated may have

00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:54,669
dependencies that need to be updated so

00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:56,979
there's a whole process on figuring out

00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,629
what are the updates that I need to

00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,849
download or what Drupal needs to

00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:03,339
downloads once we've downloaded all of

00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:05,349
the different updates or packages we

00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:07,719
want to check that they're also not

00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:09,429
compromised right we want to verify that

00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:12,700
these are things that we know and are

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:15,070
safe to update and once we've downloaded

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,739
everything once we have verified

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,709
everything we need to switch to the new

00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:21,759
code do these new updates and that's

00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:24,279
actually a little bit complicated

00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,070
because we want to support different

00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,679
workflows maybe some people want it

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:33,459
fully automated maybe other people want

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,739
a quick manual approval step so we need

00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:38,229
to be able to fit that into different

00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:40,899
workflows but then we also need to

00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:43,719
account for what to do when things fail

00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:46,059
right so we need to have the opportunity

00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:48,309
or the ability to do a rollback

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:50,709
if the update didn't work and so you

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:52,359
know switching to new updates it may

00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:55,389
sound easy but it's actually not that

00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,820
easy and so if we think about these four

00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:00,879
pieces the way we have been working on

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,320
them you can see on the screen so you

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,019
know we've been working on integrity

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,999
checks that's actually mostly done to

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:09,609
manage the dependencies and download the

00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:12,249
updates we want to switch from composer

00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:14,349
one to composer two and make that really

00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:16,779
the core of that system which it's

00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:19,359
designed to do that and composer 2 comes

00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:21,099
with some much-needed memory

00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,769
improvements which is you know why that

00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,850
is interesting to verify the updates we

00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,590
have a package signing system that were

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,720
in the background with Drupada Doric

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,510
that's mostly done and then to do the

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,570
whole switching to new updates we will

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,340
be using a custom bootloader again I

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,470
won't go into more details here but this

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,780
should give you kind of an understanding

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,240
of the plan where we're at and then

00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,220
hopefully also how you can get involved

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,820
you can help in each of these four work

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,980
streams we would love your help so if we

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,940
do that if we finish that I think that

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,190
would be fantastic

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,400
it will allow site owners to sleep well

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:02,120
at night it will reduce the maintenance

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:07,370
cost of Drupal and so I think it's a

00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,870
fantastic feature all right so there's a

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,270
whole bunch of other things of course

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,490
other than automated updates that we are

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:17,360
working on and have been working on and

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:19,130
these are very valuable these are you

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,800
know I'm passionate about many of those

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:24,020
however I decided not to include them

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,980
here because I don't think they are the

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:30,500
most important or the most strategic

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,360
relative to sort of you know defining

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,710
five strategic initiatives now that

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,810
doesn't mean we shouldn't work on them

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,920
we should definitely keep working on

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,010
them especially if you're passionate

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,560
about it but it may mean that we're not

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:46,340
prioritizing all of the resources around

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,410
them so for example the committee time

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,870
or the time that committers spent they

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,450
may prioritize other initiatives over

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,130
these initiatives so wait times might be

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,990
a little bit longer and things like that

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,450
but by all means we'll love this work

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:03,050
and keep working on it if you're

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,150
passionate about it alright see these

00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,580
are the two first buckets so now I'd

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,610
like to move on to the third bucket and

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:13,730
that is to talk about things that users

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,740
are asking us to do now the way to

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,160
figure out what users are asking you to

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:22,040
do is to do a survey and to do user

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,210
research and so guess what we did a

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,920
survey over 2000 people took the survey

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,080
which is awesome it's a lot of data

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,810
points and one of the things that we

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,200
asked every participant to do is to

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,789
self-identify so we know sort of who you

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,419
know took the survey so you can see

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:44,969
you know there's back-end developers 50%

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,449
of them identified as back-end

00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:50,129
developers there's site builders and the

00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:51,869
difference between back-end developers

00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:55,259
and site builders just to be clear is

00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:57,839
that site builders tend to me more

00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:00,419
visibly and drag and drop right so they

00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,940
don't necessarily open up an IDE to

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,749
create a custom module they try to do

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,579
things through the UI content creators

00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:11,849
and then sellers so sellers meaning

00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:15,149
those that help you know sell Drupal to

00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:16,979
potential users now if you do the math

00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:18,749
it doesn't add up to a hundred it's

00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:21,839
actually over a hundred and that's

00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:24,690
simply because people can self-identify

00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,609
as more than one persona like a lot of

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,919
content creators are also site builders

00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:31,649
some developers are both back-end and

00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,339
front-end developers so that's why the

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:38,339
total number is more than a hundred now

00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:41,579
what I did is for each of those personas

00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:43,919
I looked at the data and I looked at the

00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,499
top two requests for each of the

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,229
personas and the way I filtered the data

00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:52,499
is that I looked at the top two has

00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:54,959
voted on by the persona so what that

00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:57,419
eliminates is maybe a content creator

00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:59,789
voting on you know back-end developer

00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,749
features so I thought it was important

00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:06,419
to kind of use that filtering and then I

00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:08,789
also filtered by Drupal ade experience

00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,029
so quite a few people that took the

00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:15,539
survey had not used Drupal 8 yet because

00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:17,519
they're still on Drupal 7 and so if I

00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,249
didn't filter the data by Drupal 8

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,449
experience a lot of the requests would

00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:24,839
be for things that we've already

00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:28,829
implemented you know try Drupal 8 in

00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:32,639
Drupal 9 right so that's why I filter

00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:35,579
the data this way so it's basically as

00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:37,739
an example you know what do back-end

00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,589
developers experience with Drupal 8

00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:42,539
asked to do for other back-end

00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:44,969
developers that's the idea if you look

00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,440
at the data there's actually quite a bit

00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:49,169
of data points for each of those

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,509
personas hundreds of answers that we

00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:54,820
considered and then what I did

00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:57,159
quite simply and by the way I will make

00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,409
all of this data available and all of

00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:03,519
the details so you can do your own

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:06,009
analysis this is my analysis and so then

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,199
what I did is I basically put the stop

00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:09,729
to requests for each of the personas in

00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:13,209
a table and so I'm gonna reveal it to

00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:17,199
you now I'll go you know bottom to top

00:33:13,209 --> 00:33:19,329
to build up some suspension given that a

00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:21,399
lot of you are back in developers but

00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:24,009
sellers they basically asked for things

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,589
that help them demo Drupal and the

00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:29,109
number one thing was a better looking

00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:31,829
administration theme and the second

00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:34,419
thing was out-of-the-box integrations

00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:36,579
specifically integrations with marketing

00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:39,279
technologies because that's what

00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:40,839
end-users then to ask for they want to

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,759
see that Drupal can do the things that

00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:45,159
they want to do and that it looks good

00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,159
and that it's easy to use so no real

00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,709
surprise there content creators also

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,679
asked for a more modern administration

00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:56,079
UI and you know one that's responsive

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,749
and snappy and sort of application like

00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,909
and then they also asked for easier to

00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:04,049
use page building tools so despite the

00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:07,359
layout builder they want even more

00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:09,009
easy-to-use page building tools that

00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,950
could be improvements to the layout

00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:15,190
builder but also I think out of the box

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:18,629
blocks like maybe to add a title or an

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,419
image or different components on pages

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:24,129
so that's content creators so moving up

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:28,419
site builders they asked for automated

00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:31,480
updates and more modules in core now the

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,879
more modules in core is interesting and

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,179
we did have a little bit of a follow-up

00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:42,190
research on this and the reason why is

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:45,309
really many fault one is you know 80% of

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,079
the websites use you know very similar

00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:48,609
modules and people are a little bit

00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,919
tired of having to download these

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,769
modules and install them they just want

00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:55,509
them to be there but also by adding them

00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:58,180
to core it removes some of the

00:34:55,509 --> 00:35:00,309
maintenance burden it makes it easier to

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,740
update those modules and so actually

00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:06,490
some of that could be fixed by automated

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,160
updates in core next front-end

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:13,420
developers they asked us to modernize

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,700
the JavaScript in core and you know to

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,869
look at JavaScript frameworks they also

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,460
asked for a component based theme system

00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:23,650
and I won't go into the details of what

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:27,519
that is here but more modern way of

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,950
building and designing front ends last

00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,680
but not least back-end developers they

00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:36,099
asked for improved API documentation

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,099
that was a number one ask and we did

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:42,039
have a question in the survey that was

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:45,180
kind of a deep dive on that specifically

00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:48,849
and what this was about was actually

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,730
less about the quality of the API

00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:53,380
documentation it was all about the

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,500
discoverability and the search ability

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,210
of the API documentation so that's what

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,910
we learned from the survey again the

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,640
details are in the detailed survey

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,670
results but it just wanted to be easier

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,990
to find the documentation that we have

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,420
and the second thing was to replace the

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,299
hook system with events and this one

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,619
actually made me smile because you know

00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:17,559
years ago this was a little bit

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:19,539
controversial where most people lost the

00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,380
hook system now people want the event

00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:25,029
system and I think that's great because

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:28,240
it means two things one they serve a

00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:33,279
general interest in moving away from old

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,710
Drupal isms but also I think people want

00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:37,839
one system versus two system so cleaning

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,529
that up is important for the developer

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,230
experience no doubt so these are the top

00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:46,210
juice for each of the personas now you

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,490
may wonder what didn't make the list

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,019
because some of the and some of the

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,509
questions in the survey had you know

00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:54,970
more than ten different options so a lot

00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:57,759
of things didn't make the list I won't

00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:00,970
go through them all here I'll put them

00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:03,670
on this slide so if you're watching a

00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,130
recording you can hit pause you can read

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,220
a little bit more about them here to see

00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:12,509
what they didn't make the list now next

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:16,000
I wanted to look at what beginners

00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:18,040
versus experts are asking for and for me

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,860
that was important because

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,770
what I said earlier the need to really

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,230
focus on the beginner experience based

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:29,340
on the research presented in Hamsterdam

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,710
and so what I did is this I basically

00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:35,950
came up with this star system where I

00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,010
would have two stars when half or more

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,830
of the respondents of the survey said

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,780
drop everything that you're doing and do

00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,520
this which if you think about it more

00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,040
than half of the people that took the

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,290
survey were extremely passionate about

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,870
it so two stars is an incredible

00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,070
endorsement - for a feature or every

00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,790
feature request

00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:00,340
I gave something one star if one out of

00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,500
three people said drop everything and do

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,950
this which still is an incredible

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,880
endorsement for a particular feature and

00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,440
not everything on this list got a star

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,570
and so when you do that for both

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,980
beginners and experts you can actually

00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:20,230
see not only what do these personas have

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,300
conviction for but also is there

00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:27,010
consensus or a lack of consensus between

00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,500
you know beginners and experts and so if

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,620
you fill that out it looks something

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,830
like this and if you look at the data

00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:38,920
you can see that clearly automated

00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:41,560
updates is the number one it's the only

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,510
one that has two stars for beginner and

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,010
expert so a lot of conviction from both

00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,830
experience levels and also a lot of

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,850
consensus because both of them really

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:57,460
want this the number two is clearly

00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:02,680
modern administration UI it has the most

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:05,920
stars next to you know automated updates

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,220
and it also came back in to persona so

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,980
what I did is I put all of those you

00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:15,280
know top feature requests in this bucket

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,530
and I add a two stars to automated

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,490
updates and one star to a modern HUD

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:23,200
menu I and I did that

00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:27,700
sorry just as a reminder so we don't

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,640
forget about what had the most votes you

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,900
know based on based on a survey all

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,059
right so next the fourth

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,829
get is things that we must do to attract

00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:38,049
new users and for drupal to stay

00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:40,960
irrelevant for the next decades let's

00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:42,640
say it is this longer-term and you know

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,680
there's nothing new here i've been

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,609
talking about this for many many years

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,279
actually and as recently as DrupalCon

00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:54,039
amsterdam where have you know reminded

00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:57,430
people that we are evolving from a

00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:00,039
browser only world where a CMS was a

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,279
standalone application where he did

00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,950
manual entry of content and it would

00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,960
generate an HTML page or HTML pages

00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,119
you know we're evolving from that world

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,270
to something much more complex something

00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:16,059
much more rich where you have many

00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:19,059
different integrations with back in

00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:22,690
technology and marketing technology very

00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:25,569
have many different output channels not

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:28,660
only you know web pages HTML pages but

00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:30,520
mobile applications chat voice you know

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,410
you name it and all of that happens in

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,470
many different formats you know could be

00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:38,319
JSON could be XML could obviously be

00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:40,900
HTML too and that's really where the

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,539
world continues to go and as I mentioned

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,000
I believe this is a multi-decade

00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:48,220
trends you know we're years into this so

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,109
this is nothing new but I think we have

00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,990
a long way to go and I think we should

00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:55,390
expect an acceleration of this trend as

00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,819
well just to put that in perspective you

00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:01,420
know one data point today there's about

00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:03,789
20 billion devices and it's expected

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,970
that in less than 10 years there will be

00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:07,720
300 billion devices connected to the

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,260
Internet

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,630
generating data with or without displays

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,079
but you know just an explosion of

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:19,000
content an explosion of data and so

00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,640
that's why it's really important for

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,099
Drupal to continue to evolve from a web

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,890
content management to what I call a

00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:30,309
Content repository to more of a

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:33,190
structured data engine where we need to

00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:35,349
think about it you know supporting more

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,170
kinds of different content may be binary

00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:40,990
content even where we need to think

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,240
about managing much more content than

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,390
we've ever managed just more volume of

00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,760
content not only different kinds of

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:50,400
content and verba need to make it really

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,470
really easy to integrate with both these

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,590
back-end systems and these front-end

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,720
systems and so the integration part is

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:00,090
really important you know back-end and

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,100
front-end integrations now in addition

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,890
to that there's actually another

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:08,090
important trends Ana Trent is a

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:12,240
front-end developers don't always love

00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:13,230
PHP you know even though PHP is faster

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,690
than ever before

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:19,140
even though PHP is better and richer

00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:21,690
than ever before front-end developers

00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:25,500
don't always love it right so and if you

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:29,220
look at the numbers while PHP is vast

00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,930
while PHP powers like almost 80% of all

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,720
of the websites in the world which is

00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,080
incredible the numbers are starting to

00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,210
decline and if you compare them to the

00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,210
JavaScript numbers you can see in this

00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,430
case you know react that the adoption of

00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,010
JavaScript and react is literally

00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:51,180
exploding and it doesn't look like it's

00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:53,580
gonna stop any time soon the same is

00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,700
true actually for other frameworks like

00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,740
view you can see view same thing

00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,100
growth is of the charge then if you put

00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,470
them next to each other you can see that

00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,690
you know PHP styl like what ten times or

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:09,510
more than ten times bigger then react

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,970
and almost you know ten times bigger

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:17,250
than react and view together so there's

00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:20,100
no reason to panic PHP is strong but you

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:23,130
know I do think we should really look at

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,260
embracing more JavaScript in Drupal

00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,140
especially for the front end and this

00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,450
made me think if I were to start Drupal

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,350
today you know almost twenty years after

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:36,960
I started rupal if I were if I were to

00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:39,330
start today I would write the front end

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,640
in JavaScript to be quite honest I

00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:45,270
wouldn't write it in PHP now it's a

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,370
different story for the back end I may

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,470
not write the back end in JavaScript but

00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,960
the front end to me with all of the

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,450
richness of the JavaScript community all

00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,310
the components that they have to build

00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,190
from thence it feels like a no-brainer

00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,680
to to do that so I put JavaScript in

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:05,490
services on the list and so this is the

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,380
list right so this is the ten and you

00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,480
know the list of initiatives that I

00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:13,440
think we should consider and so now

00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,510
let's select five which is a hard part

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,150
so what I did is I just kind of flip

00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,730
this on its head if you will and I

00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:25,290
created these empty slots for five

00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:25,680
initiatives to consider alright are you

00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:30,210
ready

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:33,210
um so for me the first three initiatives

00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,280
are actually no brainers you know we

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,940
have to get ready for Drupal 10 we have

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:43,079
to make sure that Drupal is secure so we

00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:46,170
have to manage these components the next

00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,599
two easy out-of-the-box a new front and

00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:51,329
theme I believe they're so important

00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,869
we're so close we need to finish them

00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:57,030
it's the right thing to do it's like

00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:59,609
we're so close to the finish line and

00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:02,010
pushing it over the finish line is where

00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:04,530
we unlock the real value of all of the

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:08,700
work which is improving that beginner

00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:13,170
experience so yeah for me these are

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:15,839
really important at a fort one I also

00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,480
think is obvious you know we have been

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,240
working on it and it's by far the number

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,550
one request you know by far the number

00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,930
one feature request so automated updates

00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:32,910
in my mind has to be item number four

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:35,790
and not only is it useful for security

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:38,160
updates and hopefully other updates I

00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:42,569
actually do believe it's very strategic

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,089
if you think about what we're doing you

00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:48,420
know I've been pushing for this idea of

00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:50,700
the assembled web which nowadays people

00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,190
call you know composable architectures

00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:56,339
where you can basically you know mix and

00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,710
match modules to build different kinds

00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,780
of applications in a very composable way

00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,720
sort of like LEGO pieces which is

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,010
exactly how people describe Drupal so we

00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,400
have a real strengths there but if we

00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:11,040
could make it easier to manage all of

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,940
these components and to update them it

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,670
really could accelerate this way

00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,980
of the assembled web or composable

00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,530
architectures and if you think about

00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:23,560
what could come after this it's not just

00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,160
automated updates but also making it

00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,710
easier to you know find and install

00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,140
modules where you have like a module

00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,210
browser from within Drupal and maybe a

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,940
distribution browser from within Drupal

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:39,640
I think that we take a lot of complexity

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,070
out of group 'el and getting started

00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,740
with Drupal so really good for beginners

00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:47,730
but really also long-term strategic in

00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:50,170
terms of you know ease of use

00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,760
flexibility composable architecture so

00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,730
I'm actually pretty excited about that

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,330
for more than one reason

00:46:53,730 --> 00:47:01,420
so now last but not least again I have

00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:04,780
to go with the vote of the users which

00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,650
is a modern admin UI I got the second

00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:11,890
most votes after automated updates I

00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:14,050
think it's really important so let's

00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,690
talk about that so some of you may

00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:21,040
remember we actually had an initiative

00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:23,410
to modernize Drupal's admin UI and we

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,650
actually did a lot of great work we

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,680
identified sort of all of the parts and

00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,660
we identified what was hard and easy we

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,120
did prototyping and I think even showed

00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,970
some of these prototypes in previous

00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:42,100
Drees notes or Drupal con presentations

00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:44,500
and we set various things in motion but

00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:47,560
we also learned in doing all of that

00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,960
work that the scope is very very large

00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:53,620
that redesigning the complete

00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,080
administration UI is a lot of work and

00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,120
so you know we should have known better

00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,540
and that includes me and all of the core

00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,270
committers

00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,190
that this was huge but I'm still very

00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,380
grateful of all of the work that we've

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:08,260
done because the fact that we learned so

00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,360
much and so if you think about the scope

00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,940
there's all these pieces that we had to

00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,720
do which may not be obvious at first but

00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,550
we identified a number of architectural

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,680
changes we need to make some of them

00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:24,250
pretty hard like how do you validate

00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,810
configuration entities as an example and

00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:30,230
then we identified

00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:32,180
we had not complete coverage obviously

00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,220
with our web service API sand that we

00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,440
needed to add a lot of web service API

00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,630
and we did that and some of that lives

00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,110
in contrib and all of these things were

00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:45,350
necessary to even begin to redesign the

00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:47,450
administration UI using JavaScript

00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:50,570
components which is what we want to to

00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:53,420
use and so you know good progress was

00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:55,310
made but we don't have a new admin UI to

00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:59,300
show for because it was just so large

00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:01,910
and so what I'd like to propose next is

00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,280
that we actually kind of pivot and that

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:07,790
we reduce the scope and that we take a

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:11,510
small but specific step to set this

00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:16,850
admin UI work in motion and I'll explain

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:19,190
what I mean by that so first of all if

00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:22,390
we go back to this slides there's all

00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:24,710
these pieces and you know obviously

00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,090
we're not showing you all of the details

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,420
but the way I think we should go about

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:32,120
it is it's basically follow the Pareto

00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:34,400
principle which effectively says that

00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,070
you should focus on the most impactful

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,810
problem first and then once you solve

00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:41,900
that problem you move on to the next

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,820
problem eventually you arrive sort of at

00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,500
the finish line after you solved

00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,750
you know most or all of your problems

00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,820
now actually think we solved some of the

00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,500
biggest problems already in my mind

00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,430
that's getting content in and out of

00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:57,350
Drupal which we did by adding the JSON

00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,660
API module but if I think about what

00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:04,430
could be the next biggest problem in

00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:06,500
terms of impact I think it's menus you

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:09,260
know if you think about all of the sites

00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:13,580
and applications that exist almost all

00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:15,410
of them have a menu to navigate and it's

00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,450
also really hard for JavaScript

00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:19,820
developers you know because you have to

00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:22,190
think about hierarchies some of these

00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,560
menu items may be module defined or

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:27,080
programmatic if you will some of them

00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,040
are user-defined you have to think about

00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:33,320
that aliases access control I mean menus

00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:38,320
sound in easy but they're actually

00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:40,580
really hard and as a result most

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,280
applications hard coded them

00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,080
like nobody built them to be sort of

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,420
dynamic they're all hard-coded because

00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:51,710
frankly there is no web service API in

00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:53,600
Drupal for managing menus and when I

00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,550
looked at some of the competitors they

00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,010
don't have an elegant solution for this

00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:02,750
either so it seems like there is an

00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:04,400
opportunity to solve menus so that you

00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,900
know you don't have to resort to hard

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,090
coding them which you know it looks a

00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,730
little bit like this where a developer

00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,280
has to check out the project make code

00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,020
changes you know commit those and then

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,700
you know deploy them and go through the

00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,220
whole deployment process all along the

00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,220
way so you know there has to be a better

00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:25,220
way and for us

00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:26,510
CMS experts it's not that hard to

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,210
imagine what that would look like

00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:33,920
meaning the better way is for in this

00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:36,230
case our June to be able to make changes

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,270
through the menu in the Drupal back-end

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,210
and then have these changes

00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:43,820
automatically reflected in the front-end

00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:47,450
application like this is what everybody

00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:49,670
expects a CMS to do yet in the headless

00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:53,050
CMS world and in Drupal

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:56,180
this isn't solved properly right and so

00:51:53,050 --> 00:52:00,560
if we can solve this we would empower

00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:02,230
our June and obviously you know and Maya

00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,590
to because she wouldn't have to do this

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:10,580
all the time right and so specifically I

00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:14,090
believe our mission should be to provide

00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:18,470
the best way for JavaScript front ends

00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:20,930
to consume configurable menus managed in

00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,510
Drupal now that's a lot so let me break

00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:26,450
that down and help you understand what I

00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:29,540
think we should do I believe we should

00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:32,690
have an official components for react

00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,310
and ship an official component for react

00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:37,280
I believe we should have an official

00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:39,860
component for view as well so that we

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,900
are not dependent on one framework and

00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,910
that we can build this with you know

00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,590
abstraction in mind and I think we

00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,630
should really think about the developer

00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:50,120
experience and specifically the

00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,280
front-end developer experience so that

00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,080
we deliver it in a way that they expect

00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,140
it to be delivered we

00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,110
I imagine is true NPM you know the way

00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,360
other components are made available to

00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,430
them when building an application and if

00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,590
we do this well we could have another

00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,000
advantage over some of the headless

00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,350
CMS's and actually have a better

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,770
developer experience and a better

00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:19,880
end-user experience now for some this

00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:22,700
may sound like maybe a small step right

00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,260
menus is that really that interesting

00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,770
and I think it actually is really

00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,410
interesting because in reality and I

00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:33,170
alluded to this menus are pretty hard

00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:36,320
right not only do you need to add more

00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,610
web service API coverage for menus but

00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,800
you really need to figure out how to

00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,560
manage these different kinds of menus

00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,080
and hierarchies and when you're talking

00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,210
about menus you can't ignore things like

00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,270
pad aliasing and routing because when

00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:53,390
you click on a menu item you expect to

00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:55,610
navigate to another page so it really

00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:59,090
kind of pulls out some of the harder

00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:01,640
pieces to figure out and then maybe the

00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:05,300
hardest part is figuring out how we

00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,000
actually make an official component how

00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:10,640
do we go about testing JavaScript

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,500
components what about documentation how

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,020
do we create these packages how do we do

00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,150
release management for respect jiz what

00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,730
about security what about the

00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:22,340
dependencies on other JavaScript

00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,850
packages and so there's just a lot to

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,060
figure out

00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:28,070
so while it sounds easy to do menus I

00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:33,560
think it's actually quite a bit of work

00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:36,130
now menus I think are a real problem and

00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:39,320
I think it's actually a problem not many

00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,990
front-end developers have but what I'm

00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,930
actually more excited about is all the

00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:46,700
things that it sets in motion for Drupal

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,220
specifically so if you think about it

00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:53,120
what we're going to do with this first

00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:55,970
official components menus is establish a

00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:58,730
clear pattern and a pattern that can be

00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:01,880
repeated think of it as a recipe or a

00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:05,330
playbook right once we figure out how to

00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,430
build one components and how to manage a

00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:10,550
component and release a component

00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:12,319
and package and desta components we can

00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:15,530
really start building many more

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:18,260
components in parallel all following the

00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:20,359
same pattern so if we can enable all of

00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:24,440
the contributed modules to build

00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:27,589
components in a uniform way make it part

00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,589
of our tools and workflows I really I I

00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:31,819
would expect to see a lot more

00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:33,319
components components for blocks and

00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:36,079
forums and shopping carts

00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:38,750
maybe carousels and views and toolbars

00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:41,359
you know you name it and once we have

00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:43,940
enough of these components we'll be in a

00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:47,660
much better position to start improving

00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:51,230
the admin UI right if you think about

00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:53,780
building our own admin UI well we have

00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:56,059
menus too in the admin UI so that's an

00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,609
example of a component we could use

00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:00,470
we're also using views in the admin UI

00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:03,730
if there was a good component for views

00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:06,980
we would be able to use that too and so

00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:09,230
again it's what it sets in motion which

00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:12,170
is so exciting to me and and for me

00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:14,420
ultimately it actually solves a very big

00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:17,359
what I call industry problem a problem

00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,670
that everybody has and by solving it we

00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,020
can be the best decoupled CMS in the

00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,760
market and let me explain what that

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,890
means

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,020
today we often have to make trade-offs

00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,690
if you go with a headless or decoupled

00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,790
approach you're really optimizing for

00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,589
the developer experience because you

00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:35,960
allow the developer to use Java Script

00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:38,690
which is what the majority of front-end

00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,930
developers outside of Drupal typically

00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:44,540
want to use but when you do that you

00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:47,059
really compromise what I call the non

00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,549
developer experience the site builder

00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:51,260
and the content author because they lose

00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:53,420
things like menu management but also

00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:57,589
layouts and previews and many other

00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:59,660
things right and there's other modes

00:56:57,589 --> 00:57:01,609
like progressive decoupling and really

00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:04,220
that's not the ideal solution either

00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:06,799
because as a front-end developer now you

00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,380
have to learn both twig and JavaScript

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,780
because you know that's what progressive

00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:14,630
decoupling means and so the question is

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,260
can we build something that doesn't

00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:20,990
compromise one persona that you know is

00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,880
both a positive experience and I think

00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,520
we can if you think about the menus if

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,210
we can build a menu component that can

00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,210
be used by front-end developer but that

00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:34,880
then connects into Drupal to generate

00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,580
you know the menu or the content of the

00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,950
menu it would be a win-win for a public

00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:42,560
personas and that would be a big deal

00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:44,180
and I've been blogging about this for a

00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,270
couple of years and you may have seen

00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:51,440
some of my blog posts in those I put

00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:53,060
these complicated flowcharts to help you

00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,550
know people decide you to go with

00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:58,400
coupled decoupled you know something in

00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,690
between and there might be an

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,310
opportunity to get rid of those

00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:08,390
flowcharts or at least make the choice a

00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:11,180
lot easier or not us dramatic so an

00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:13,250
official JavaScript components an

00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,320
official react an official view

00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:18,080
JavaScript component we've never had

00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:21,200
this would be a first in the lifetime of

00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,630
Drupal in the 20 years of Drupal and I

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,280
think it's actually a giant leap for

00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:29,090
Drupal to add the first official

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:32,390
component so what I am proposing is that

00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:34,850
we don't do the modern administration UI

00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:37,280
that we learned from the past that that

00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:40,700
is too big of a scope and that instead

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,510
we focus on a JavaScript menu component

00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:47,840
to make that first step and to you know

00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:50,420
set that snowball in motion to make that

00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,640
start rolling and if you think about it

00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,920
a little bit more it's actually very

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,500
strategic for other reasons because I

00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,720
believe it allows us to make some

00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,450
progress on some of these other

00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,340
important initiatives it really connects

00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,780
into a lot of things it helps us

00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,560
modernize JavaScript

00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:12,230
it helps us evolve into a component

00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,480
based theming approach it improves web

00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:17,480
services because we have to add more API

00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,850
coverage and eventually I think it can

00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,440
me to ease your page building and a more

00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:27,380
modern administration UI so I'm not

00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,750
saying it solves these initiatives what

00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,240
I'm saying is it helps us make some

00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,170
important progress so I think of the

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,930
JavaScript menu component

00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:39,660
initiative as you know very strategic

00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:41,550
actually as I just explained in the last

00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,040
five to 10 minutes so here's the five

00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:46,770
proposed initiatives that I think we

00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,230
should discuss and consider and I've had

00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,760
an opportunity to run them by the core

00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,660
committers and they're on board and I

00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:58,590
talked to some others about this as well

00:59:53,660 --> 01:00:00,300
but open for feedback by all means and I

00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,680
believe they're well balanced you know

01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,180
as I said in the beginning we need to

01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,100
make sure they're well balanced I think

01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,560
they help with technical debt an

01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,390
innovation I think we're looking at

01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,280
different stakeholders beginners and

01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:14,250
experts but also developers and non

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,600
developers and you know making progress

01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:20,730
to be a great catalyst and decoupled CMS

01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:24,660
in addition to be a great traditional

01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:27,900
CMS this approach of API first but not

01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:30,150
API only I think if organizations and

01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:33,150
individuals a very clear reason to adopt

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,620
and I think it puts us on a path to be

01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:37,350
long-term relevant

01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:39,740
last but not least I think it's hard

01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:43,500
work it's a lot of work but also

01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:46,260
achievable maybe a stretch a slight

01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,990
stretch but it feels achievable in the

01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,300
next 16 months to make some growth

01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:54,120
progress I would actually love to see a

01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,220
stake like a flying start if you will

01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,680
with the JavaScript menu components

01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:02,340
imagine we could add a first component

01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:05,850
in Drupal 9.2 maybe we can get some more

01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:08,820
components in by 9.3 I know this is a

01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:10,020
little bit wishful thinking but um it

01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:13,110
might be worth a shot

01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:15,780
so you know we have to get organized

01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:17,940
around this we don't have all the

01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:21,180
details figured out or we haven't made

01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:23,550
plans for everything we need initiative

01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:27,180
leads for each of these things in some

01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:30,510
cases we already have leads in other

01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:33,270
cases not and we've also learned that it

01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:35,880
helps to have a main sponsor and a main

01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:39,810
sponsor is an organization or someone

01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:43,800
who provides resources usually time and

01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:47,070
talent sometimes money to to help drive

01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,880
the initiative you know with the help of

01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,440
others in

01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,170
loading volunteers so they don't have to

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,150
do all of the work but they are you know

01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:56,960
the main sponsor so we're also looking

01:01:54,150 --> 01:02:00,000
for a main sponsors if you're interested

01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:03,029
we have contribution tables at these

01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,640
events you see the link at the bottom of

01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:08,130
the page you can join those and raise

01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:12,059
your hand and it will help welcome you

01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:13,589
and help you get involved so if you want

01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,000
to learn more about some of these things

01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:17,480
that I just talked about we actually

01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,299
have a lot of sessions on these topics

01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:24,869
you can see them here some of them are

01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:27,150
tomorrow some of them are Thursday by

01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:30,180
all means if you're excited about this

01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,980
please do get involved and if you do

01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,230
this well I think the Drupal 10 press

01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,019
release could be no pretty exciting and

01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:40,380
so kind of drafted one so let me try and

01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:44,970
read it to you okay here we go this

01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:47,160
would be June 2020 to Drupal 10 extends

01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:49,170
Drupal strength in headless or decoupled

01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,990
applications and for developers that

01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:54,710
means that Drupal 10 simplifies the

01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:57,089
development of JavaScript applications

01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,849
Drupal allows developers to use a

01:02:57,089 --> 01:03:02,460
framework of choice but it ships with

01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:05,640
out-of-the-box support for react and

01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,440
view for marketers this means that

01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,069
Drupal 10 allows the building of

01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,900
omni-channel digital experiences without

01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:15,000
giving up the ease-of-use

01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,849
that marketers and content creators

01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,500
expect this makes Drupal the best

01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:24,089
decouple CMS for less technical users

01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,039
Drupal 10 also ships with automatic

01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:28,140
automated updates this makes it

01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,839
drastically easier to maintain rupal

01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:33,599
sites and and to apply security updates

01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:36,680
it also advances drupal support for

01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,630
composable architectures like Drupal 9

01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:42,359
Drupal 10 continued its focus on

01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,700
improving the beginner experience with a

01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:47,430
new look and feel and an improved

01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:49,619
out-of-the-box experience I think that

01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:52,200
could be great if we can achieve all of

01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:55,170
that in two years I think that's worth

01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:58,289
another celebration so if you are

01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:01,650
excited about this please help I really

01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:04,859
do believe that it's not only fun to

01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:07,529
work on but it's also really an

01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:10,380
opportunity to have a positive impact on

01:04:07,529 --> 01:04:13,920
the world with that I'd like to thank

01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:16,710
you I will make the slides available on

01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,289
my site I will make the survey data

01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:22,200
available on my site I probably need a

01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:25,020
week or so to do that because this week

01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,539
is pretty busy I will not be taking

01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:31,230
questions right now but we have a

01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:33,569
dedicated 45 minutes Q&A session

01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,369
tomorrow so if you have questions if you

01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:37,260
want to talk about this more or other

01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:41,630
things you can ask questions about

01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:47,210
anything please join the Q&A session

01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:47,210
