00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
drupal

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
and javascript and how we build the web

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,240
and how

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
uh things have been changing over the

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
past few years i just see mike potter

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,080
said this is the best session title

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,080
which

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,439
thank you some of my colleagues and

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,719
business partners don't like it but i've

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,640
always been quite fond of it also so

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
um my name is tim broker otherwise known

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
as citizen tim

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,840
and i am a co-founder and technical

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,000
director at electric citizen which is

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,000
a small but mighty drupal agency

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
in minneapolis minnesota which is where

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
we should all be right now for my

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
10th consecutive drupalcon so uh very

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
disappointed that we

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
couldn't all be in person and that i

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
couldn't celebrate my

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,760
my 10th drupalcon anniversary in my home

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,440
city but i i'm

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,119
honored to have the chance to talk to

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
you here

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,799
and uh very happy to see you all so

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
[Music]

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
i started my career in the web in 1994

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
which

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
was pretty much the beginning of the web

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
i think when i built my first

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,000
uh production website that someone paid

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
me money for there were less than 10 000

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
sites on the entire internet it was

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
early 1994.

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
i have a spreadsheet somewhere i've

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
built enterprise grade

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
cms solutions and over 16 different

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,600
content management systems over those

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,759
years

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,079
but for the last 13 years i have been a

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,400
very happy and satisfied

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,600
drupal developer with a drupal agency

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,880
and loved drupal

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
and uh frankly it has sort of uh

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,159
been the focus of my career for a large

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,840
portion of it and probably

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,439
a lot of you also uh tibet to answer

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
benji my tenth consecutive north

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,200
american drupal can i have yet to make a

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,079
european dribble gun um

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
and then i put this bullet point in um

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
because this is sort of the jumping off

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,679
point for this

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,800
entire talk i attended bad camp in 2018

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
i was i was speaking on drupal but while

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
i was there there were numerous sessions

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,000
on um a new framework that was just

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
released called gatsby which you may

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
have heard of we'll talk about it more

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
later and kyle matthews the founder was

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
there and gave a great session there was

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
another gatsby session

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,599
and i was also first introduced to the

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,720
term jam stack which we will

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,640
be talking about quite a bit later um

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,280
and i came back from that conference and

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,760
for the next uh two plus years up until

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
today um i have uh pretty much immersed

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,280
myself into this world of javascript and

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
how it is changing uh what and how we

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
build the web and so this session is

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
sort of

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
a journey through uh these past two

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,920
years and uh

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,680
uh hopefully insightful and at the end

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360
uh some some

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,720
hopefully good advice on how you can get

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
started in this world so

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
i want to start by uh just giving a

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,319
quick uh brief overview of how we build

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
the web historically

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,120
i mean i've broken it up into uh three

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,599
little segments here ten year segments

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,120
um uh so again i started uh my career on

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,480
the web in 1994 and i

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
sort of referred to this period as the

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,440
renaissance where there was just this

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
literal explosion

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,159
of people building html files and then

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
css came out and then we very quickly

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
learned how to talk to a server with a

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
cgi script

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
very shortly after that we started

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
getting server side languages like asp

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
classic and php that allowed us to talk

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,040
to databases

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
and uh right about in the middle of this

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
period people started building their own

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
custom cf

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
cmss of those 16 that i talked about i

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,319
think i

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,799
in my career built three or four of my

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,400
own cmss way back in the day

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
it was also the rise of the early

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
commercial cmss if you were back there

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
back in those days there were vignette

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
and broad vision and they all came with

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
a

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,200
quarter million dollar license fees and

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,360
it was also the early days of the open

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,480
source cms

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,159
both i think drupal 1 was 2001 and

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
wordpress a little bit after that and

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
there was all sorts of

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
early rumblings in the cms but by the

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
end of this 10-year period

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
most sites are still not using the cms

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
it barely registered

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,440
on the metric some of which we'll look

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,440
at later

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:32,639
whoops i jump slides there

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,400
there we go uh so then in 2004 roughly

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
um we entered a new period where sort of

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,960
the rise of the cms and this is when

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
both drupal and wordpress

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
first really started to become popular

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
and the lamp stack was exploding

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,199
and in 2004 uh we got introduced to ajax

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,080
uh through google uh

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
gmail and sort of new ways of doing this

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
and it was sort of the origins of the

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,160
cloud and software as a service and

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
all of these commercial cmss started

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
sort of coalescing around this idea of

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
how

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,320
we build the web um

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
sort of the golden age of you know

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
taking all that stuff we've learned in

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
the past 10 years and finding sort of

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,199
common ways for us to

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,199
move forward as as we build the web

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,880
i seem to have a weird delay here when i

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,639
press my spacebar but

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,880
nonetheless so that we get to 2014

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
and i break this out into a very uh

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
distinct period for

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,800
three reasons uh react angular and view

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,880
these are all uh front end javascript

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
libraries they were all released or open

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,759
sourced roughly within a six month

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,680
period

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:46,000
uh right around 2014

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
and uh if you like me i've been going to

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
a lot of drupalcons uh

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
2014 is the year you really started

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
seeing uh

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,520
uh add that drupal uh camps session

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
after session after session on

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
headless at decoupled drupal and this

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
new approach and

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
uh there was a couple year period where

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
it seemed like most of the sessions were

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,639
talking about these

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
three frameworks i had an uh earlier

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
version of the slide with many many more

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
bullet points and all the other things

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
that were happening with node.js and

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
uh the early rise of serverless

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
functions and stuff but really i think

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,639
in the popular bind

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,199
uh it can be best defined by these three

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
front-end frameworks react of course was

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,240
released by facebook

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,120
angular by google and vue

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
by a independent developer named evan yu

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,280
and they all uh sort of were uh they

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
they all sort of came about at the same

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
time i think in response to

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
um you know that 10-year history of what

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
ajax first came out and people were

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
discovering that we needed better ways

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,039
to build the web

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
and new approaches to how we treat the

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,440
front end

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
so despite that though i would say most

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
of us here

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
of which there are now 373 of us are

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,599
still living

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,440
in 2014 and i'm very much included in

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,520
that my agency is still a drupal agency

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,199
i am still a drupal developer

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
um and the fact is the way we build

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
websites has you know we've gotten

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
better at things but it's remained

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
virtually unchanged for the past 15

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,039
years we have a database we have a web

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
server

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
we render a bunch of stuff and we push

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,520
it out to the browser and the user

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
gets it um so whether you're an agency

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,080
or a developer or a

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,280
project funder or a client this is sort

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
of the world that

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
i live in and i think a lot of you

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,840
probably uh are still living in

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,000
um and frankly it's a pretty great place

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,800
to be um

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,919
as you know uh we enjoy a multi-billion

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
dollar global market

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,039
place between uh that's the entire sort

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
of

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,479
traditional cms market um and frankly

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
drupal or wordpress or a similar

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
solution is still the default and

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,800
obvious choice for many

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,599
clients and many developers and

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
um you know this this long 10 15 year

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
history

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
has sort of uh uh

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,120
coalesced into sort of this way to do it

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,319
that that's sort of the obvious choice

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,160
that most people expect

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
and then lastly of course innovation

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
continues at great speed like

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
you know it may have fundamentally been

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
unchanged for the past 15 years but the

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
fact is we get better and better and

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
better and better with every

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,400
life cycle uh with wordpress we see

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
things like

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
berg and a much improved admin ui and

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,919
with drupal of course we have drupal 8

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,479
and now drupal 9 and all of the great

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,919
things that have come along with that so

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,279
it is a great place to be and that's

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,039
evidenced by just looking at some of the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,279
popular drupal and wordpress sites that

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519
are out there you know

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,440
it's fair to say that drupal wordpress

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
and similar solutions are running

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
many of the world's largest corporation

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,560
websites many of the largest

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,440
governmental websites

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,440
many of the largest uh educational

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
institutions non-profits you name it

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
we've sort of

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,279
conquered this world and uh know what

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,160
we're doing by this point

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,920
um as evidenced by the cms market share

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,080
so this is uh 2020 by

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,160
i think at the end of 2014 it was

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,480
roughly 35 percent of all sites were

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,240
running some form of cms

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,160
and just in the past six years that's

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
almost doubled so now where we have

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
61 percent of sites running some form of

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
traditional cms

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,360
this could be drupal wordpress

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,640
squarespace

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,080
shopify wix joomla expression engine

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
sitecore you name it some sort of

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
traditional

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,880
cms and about 40 percent of the web is

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
running on something else

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
um unidentifiable whether it's a plain

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,480
html page or

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,760
or what have you

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
so despite all that i think uh if you're

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,240
paying attention at all

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,360
um and and and are on the web and

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,040
listen to podcasts or follow follow

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
bloggers or just the general

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
zeitgeist of the web it's pretty obvious

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,519
that some things are changing

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,720
and changing quickly and so the next few

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,360
slides i'm just going to go over a few

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,240
pieces of evidence that show that the

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
next few slides

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,120
are google trends if you haven't seen it

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
it's a great tool that allows you to

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
simply measure interest over time in a

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
particular

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
topic and so i've chosen a time frame if

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,640
you're of

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,360
2004 to present which maps up nicely

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,360
with my little

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,000
time segments of how we build the web

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,720
and you can see that right in about 2014

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,560
react and angular

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
started taking off and took off like a

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
rocket and react in particular continues

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,880
to

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,920
grow and has not come close yet to reach

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
its heights angular of course

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
had a little bit of trouble with moving

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,680
from angular to angular 2 and

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,120
i think a lot of the interest dropped

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,480
off and a lot of things have changed in

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,399
this ecosystem that have made

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
angular a little less relevant than it

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
used to be and we'll talk about that

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,640
later

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,399
a few other quick uh slides a headless

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,839
ems again

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
it's first started bubbling up right in

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
by 2016 this idea of a headless or a

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,279
decoupled cms

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,760
was really taking over and again if you

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,640
were at any drupal camps or drupal cons

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,839
you probably heard multiple sessions

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,839
talking about headless cmss and why they

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,839
matter

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,079
node.js and npm node came out a few

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
years prior to 2014 but it really

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,640
started to take off

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
along with some of these other

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,880
technologies right around 2014 at the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,279
same time

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,720
um serverless technology which i'll talk

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
about again this one really took off

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
again around 2016.

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,360
um for those who don't know serverless

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
is this idea of of you know there is

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
still a server of course that's the

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,720
uh caveat but it's basically a

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
function as a service where you can just

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
put a function on

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,040
aws lambda and it will sit there and

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
you can call and run that function

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,639
anytime you want and it's a key part of

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,639
the the modern web as we'll see in a bit

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,760
a couple more jam stack again we'll talk

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
about that later but again right around

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
all of these technologies just really

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
started taking off

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
in addition to this notion of a full

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,959
stack developer

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,399
when someone says that word you can

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,800
almost guarantee that they're talking

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,920
about

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
a javascript developer not a drupal

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
developer

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,639
a wordpress developer um and that is

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,680
evidenced by

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
uh bootcamp market share in 2020 uh

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,399
there's a site called course report that

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
keeps track of all of the

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
boot camps in the world and what they're

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
teaching and a full 44 of them are

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
teaching full stack

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,279
javascript uh and five percent are

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,079
teaching php which of course is the

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,959
language of

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,240
drupal uh okay i see a little comment

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,720
someone said the slides weren't changing

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
but i'm getting confirmation that uh

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
they are for others uh for me by the way

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,720
they are really slow

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,639
in getting a leg so um but i'm doing my

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,160
best

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,279
um and now we get to drupal um this is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
drupal's uh

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,920
interest over time over that same time

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,920
period 2014 to present

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,000
and you can see that sadly we peaked

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,720
right around 2011

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,600
12 and have slowly sort of been going um

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
downhill ever since wordpress has a

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
slightly similar

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
growth curve although they of course

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
continue to grow um

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,120
and then this is uh the infamous

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
stack overflow developer survey this one

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
hurts a little bit if you're familiar

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,880
with it

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,639
stack overflow uh this year it was over

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
65 000 developers

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
um about the technologies they're using

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,680
the ones they love the ones they prefer

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,839
and uh drupal in 2020 was the number two

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,880
most dreaded web framework sadly um i

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,920
think in 2019 it was number one

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
um so i have two thoughts about this one

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
is that uh

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,959
uh dries posted a great response to this

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,560
i think on his blog that you know the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,760
more you actually start to use drupal

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,360
that this starts to flip

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,880
and the deeper you go the less dreaded

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
it becomes and the more wanted or loved

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
it becomes and i think that is very very

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
very true

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
and i think the second most important

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,560
thing about this particular slide is

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
that uh wordpress is not even in this

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,680
survey

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,399
it's not considered by stack overflow to

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
even be

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
a web framework it's a cms whereas

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
drupal is being treated

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,199
truly as a web framework so i think that

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,199
is great also

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
um and now i'm going to leave the stats

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
behind and go into some just anecdotal

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,920
evidence so

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
this is a quote so in our agency of

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
course like many we're often responding

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
to

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
rfps and for many years especially over

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,800
that

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,720
high period of drupal's great interest

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
level we would frequently get

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,440
rfps and requests saying hey we want a

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,680
drupal site

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
um and we're a drupal agency and it was

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,279
this great period in time where just by

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
the nature of being a drupal agency you

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,120
could win work

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,079
and and people were coming to us for a

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,839
drupal site and

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,680
uh this came last year we often send out

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,199
questions to the client saying like hey

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,120
you know are you are you interested in

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,480
drupal um

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
and the response we got back was we

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
would prefer javascript based

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,040
applications we would steer clear of

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
drupal

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,560
um of course as a drupal agency starting

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,959
to see stuff like that gets to be a

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,160
little

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,880
uh worrisome and but it's real it's uh

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,000
no longer do we get calls or emails

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,600
simply because we are drupal developers

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
some other anecdotal evidence i want to

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,279
look at two sort of classic

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,120
uh drupal sites that for forever uh

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
i think the weather channel first

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
launched i forget what year but both the

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
economist and the weather channel have

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,360
historically been held up as

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,079
shining examples of what drupal can drew

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
can do

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
the weather channel in particular i

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
believe is still one of the highest

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,600
traffic websites

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
on the internet and the economist of

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
course is an internationally famous

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
publication and for years again you can

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,560
still go to the drupal case study site

00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
these sites are still up there but what

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
i

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,440
learned in prep for this session is that

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
both of them in 2020 have moved away

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
from drupal um the economist is on now

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,839
on a go platform

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,600
with a distributed rest api and the

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
weather channel has moved to a node.js

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
backend with a react

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,440
front-end and i found this actually in a

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,040
conference talk submission by

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
a weather.com employee and in his uh

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,839
submission they talked about why they

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,880
moved away from drupal uh

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,720
poor performance sluggish load times and

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
unreliable availability

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
instability they had a ver they were

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
using drupal with angular but they did

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,480
it all in a sort of monolithic

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,079
application where

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
it was all being pushed together and

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,240
they had trouble with that

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,079
and slower developer velocity the

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,279
majority of our developers had front-end

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
experience but very

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,839
very few of them were knowledgeable

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
about the inner workings of drupal and

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,519
php

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,160
so what this all sort of adds up to i

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,920
think is

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,519
is this battle or dichotomy between

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,880
what we've been doing for the past 15

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
years which i'm going to refer to as the

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
monolithic cms

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,640
and again that can be drupal or

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,199
wordpress or expression engine or square

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,360
space or or any sort of traditional cms

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,280
and what i'm going to refer to

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,720
mainly for convenience as the modern web

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,400
in the next few slides i'm going to do

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,079
my best job to sort of explain

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,400
the difference between those two

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,959
so again the monolithic cms this is what

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,440
we've been doing for

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,640
the past 15 years and it hasn't changed

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
much

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
at the center you have a content

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
management system

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,760
whether it's drupal or wordpress or any

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
other system and

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,799
everything runs through that system if

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
you are going to do an integration it's

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,840
going to run through your cms

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
if you're going to plug in commerce

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,840
you're probably going to pick drupal

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
commerce or woocommerce for wordpress

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,200
to search you're going to be looking at

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
the drupal search api and so on all the

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
way around the board if you're going to

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,799
write custom code

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,200
you're going to write a drupal module

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
everything runs through the cms of

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,039
course tied to a database and a web

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,240
server and if you're lucky

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,919
you're behind a great cache layer and

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,919
ultimately this big monolithic cms

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
talks to the server generates a bunch of

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,000
html and pushes it to the user right

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,679
that's what we've been doing for just

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
about forever

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,360
and there are some great advantages to

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,880
that of course

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,240
it's proven in time tested as i said

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
we've been doing this for 15 years and

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
we just get better and better and better

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,440
at it and the

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,480
infrastructure gets better the hosting

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,520
platforms like pantheon and aquia

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,200
get better it's extremely flexible as

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,559
as evidenced by that earlier slide with

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,320
all of these huge

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,000
corporations and government entities and

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,360
schools there's very

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,559
little you can't do in this framework

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,400
and we've solved most of the hard stuff

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
we know how to do entity references and

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,039
we now know how to handle media and we

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
know how to do

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,640
caching and all of these sort of

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
difficult problems

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
in the content management world have

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
been solved and again we have

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,919
lots of ongoing innovations not like

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
we've stopped whether you're drupal or

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
wordpress or any other cms these

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,240
continue to grow and evolve

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,520
but by the same token there are a few

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,480
sort of

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,240
issues um historical issues that that

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,000
aren't going away and uh

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
i think are very real um the first is

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
that it's these

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,200
sites can be very expensive to build um

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
anyone who runs a drupal agency or has

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,559
gotten a bid for a

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,320
complex ambitious drupal or wordpress

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,080
website knows that it's

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,840
not a inexpensive proposition

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
these monolithic cmss can be very

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
expensive to host and scale

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
you're typically relying on the

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
infrastructure of a giant company like

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,960
pantheon or aqua and

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,240
load balancing and cache layers and a

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,280
global cdn

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,440
etc and that gets very expensive

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,039
you know we're talking anywhere from 400

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,840
to many thousands of dollars a month

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
just to

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
you know get your feet on the ground the

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
days of sort of shared hosting i think

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,760
are long over

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,679
uh platform lock-in despite how flexible

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,159
any of these cms's are you know once you

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,600
lock into drupal or wordpress you know

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,240
you're there and it's going to be an

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,720
effort to get out of that if you want to

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
um thankfully most of us don't want to

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
but the fact is

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,159
you buy into this platform and once

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,080
you're in there you're in there

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,880
without expecting quite a bit of effort

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,799
to get out uh from nlakin again

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,480
um drupal we use twig i don't know that

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,080
wordpress even has an official theme

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
engine but you're locked into this idea

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,120
of a php

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,400
templated theme and it is what it is and

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,600
and you do your best

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,520
and uh to provide a good experience

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
within that uh framework or within that

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
paradigm

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
uh these sites are also quite expensive

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,159
in our experience to support

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,760
uh over time it's not like you launch a

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,960
drupal site and walk away from it you

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,559
are

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
constantly churning through security

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,760
updates and module updates and minor

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
version updates and major version

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,720
updates and uh kind of never ends it's a

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:04,159
very expensive system to buy into both

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
on multiple levels and of course

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
you know you can argue that many people

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
have solved this and the drupal sites

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
aren't so bad but

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,280
it cannot it's also fairly easy to argue

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,520
that a lot of these are quite

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120
slow and and bulky and if you look at

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,480
lighthouse scores of a typical

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,240
drupal or wordpress site they don't

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,080
always

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,600
do so great another problem with the

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,640
monolithic cms

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,320
and i am as guilty of this as anybody

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,919
this is mass laws maxim when all you

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
have is a hammer everything looks like a

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,039
nail

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
um it's very very easy when you've been

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,280
developing

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,880
drupal for for 15 years like i have to

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,679
see it as the solution for just about

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
everything because it really can be

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
but by the same token that's not always

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,159
the uh

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
greatest thing in the world when there

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
may be other solutions out there that

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
are better

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,039
so i am now going to contrast that with

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,640
what i again i'm referring to as the

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,600
modern web or another way to think about

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
it is the distributed web or

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,679
a great phrase from the old unix days

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
small pieces loosely joined it is a

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,720
very very different paradigm than this

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
idea of running everything

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
your theme your commerce your search uh

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
your

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,200
everything through a single stack

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,600
it looks a little bit more like this

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,559
so again this small piece is loosely

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,320
joined instead of

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
instead of running through one central

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,760
stack in the center

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,480
you have all these little pieces on the

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,120
side that are coming together to combine

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
into a singular experience but they're

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,799
all coming from different places so you

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,159
probably still have adless cms

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
but it doesn't have to be drupal or

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
wordpress it can be one

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,720
we're going to talk more about some

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,000
headless cmss in a bit uh you're

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
probably going to be connecting to one

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
or more external apis to get some data

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
from

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,960
uh you may be relying on real-time data

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,000
from mongodb

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,360
or some other service you're likely to

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,039
be writing some serverless functions

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,960
like i talked about before to do things

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,559
in the backend for your site and you are

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
highly likely to be relying on some

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,320
managed

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,960
services software as a service or or

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,799
i have more examples of that later but

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,320
the idea is again rather than this one

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,159
monolithic stack that you're building on

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,880
you're sort of picking and choosing

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,760
a bunch of little pieces to put together

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,679
into a modern website or web app

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
increasingly that means that you're

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
hosting your website directly off of the

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
global cdn this is especially true in

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
the jamstack world which again i'll talk

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,360
about more

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
but where you are no longer churning out

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,640
service

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,440
server rendering pages on an expensive

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
database

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
and and pushing them out to the user

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
you're often now able to literally host

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
your whole application directly on the

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,559
edge

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,400
which is amazing and uh you'll also

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,279
likely may be interacting with a node.js

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,520
server

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,039
to do various backend tasks and

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,320
ultimately in the at the end of the day

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,320
you're pushing all of that out

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,760
uh with your your front-end library you

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
bring your bring your own front end and

00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
you

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,919
bring your own distributed back in and

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,080
ultimately your job then is to

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,360
build a nice user experience using

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,400
whichever tools seem

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,720
seem best to you at that point in time

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,480
and of course um all of these tools

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,400
again i'm getting some slag slide leg

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,559
here but all of these tools are based in

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
javascript this session is not called

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,360
go is coming to each you or rust is

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,000
coming to each you although those are

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,640
both becoming quite popular languages

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,440
the fact is that in 2020 javascript is

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,600
the language of the web

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,520
and uh for those of us living in 2014

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
um it's time to i think come to terms

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,600
with that a little bit

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,039
um another key factor about the modern

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
web is that

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,880
all of these little pieces have been

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,200
commoditized

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,960
and or free you can now get dozen picked

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
from dozens of off-the-shelf headless

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,799
cmss

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,640
there are free tiers of authentication

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,720
services like auth0 you can

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
outsource your search to elasticsearch

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
or algolia

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
you can sign up for free or paid apis to

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
pull in data

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,440
all of these front-end libraries are

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,640
free

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,240
uh through uh netlify which is a great

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,919
hosting platform i'll talk about a bit

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,600
later you can run up to i think a

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,799
quarter of a million free serverless

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,000
function calls

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,559
without paying a dime um you know

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,159
similar to how uh we've solved a lot of

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,400
problems in the

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,840
monolithic cms world all of these

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
problems in the modern web have been

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,120
sort of solved and

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,799
and commoditized which is a key key

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
component of it

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,240
because what that means then is that

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,960
rather than focusing all of our energy

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,559
on on building the best possible

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,000
drupal site within the constraints of

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
what drupal might be we

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
are now focusing on energy on picking

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,000
the best tools for each

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,360
little job that we might have to do uh

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
building the front end the way

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,039
exactly the way we want whether it's a

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
interactive web app or a

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,080
fast speedy react website whatever it

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,640
might be

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,799
and really focusing on the user

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,159
experience versus like hey let's

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,240
we're not building a drupal site anymore

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,880
we're building user experiences by sort

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
of

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,480
combining all of these tools together

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,080
so another way to look at it is that in

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,320
the um

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,400
monolithic cms our goal is to build the

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,960
best possible user experience with it

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,559
within the constraints of my cms and we

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,720
do a pretty good job of that

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,080
on the modern web our job is to build

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,600
the best possible experience

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,200
by combining the best tools and

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,400
components it's a very different model

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
so it is easy though especially if like

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,240
me

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
you've been a drupal developer for any

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
length of time to still remain pretty

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,400
skeptical of this

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,919
of this world

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
questions you might ask yourself can

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,200
can't drupal also provide a great user

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,799
experience

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
won't i lose a lot of out-of-the-box

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,279
features from drupal if i

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,440
if i start exploring this this pathway

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,000
and isn't this just another

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
expensive set of problems to solve and

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,919
of course the answer to all three of

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,120
those questions is an unqualified

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,320
yes you can of course build a great user

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
experience in drupal

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,919
and if you leave drupal behind you are

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,360
going to leave behind

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,640
a lot of great things about drupal that

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,039
are sort of built in into this

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
monolithic platform that allows it to do

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,200
what it does

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
um but i think the question we should

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,159
all be asking ourselves is what if

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,600
despite all that there is a better way

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,679
to build the web and so the next few

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,440
slides um

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,960
i'm going to look at that and sort of uh

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,799
from an objective and hopefully

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
pragmatic perspective look at some of

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,760
the

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,440
uh i've got five key criteria here for

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,960
what makes a good website

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,960
we could obviously add a bunch more but

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
i think these are our five pretty key

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,399
criteria for

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,399
for what what what you know why why what

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,399
are we building and what makes it good

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,760
speed of course is uh increasingly

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,600
important as the world goes more and

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,360
more mobile

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,799
flexibility the ability to do what you

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,279
want with your cms

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,880
and change it over time the user

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
experience what the end user is actually

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
getting at the end of the day the

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,159
developer experience what we as

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,679
developers and designers and agencies

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
are experiencing as we're building these

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,960
sites

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
and uh lastly the overall cost so i'm

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,919
just going to quickly

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,679
zoom through all five of these and and

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,000
again you know i've been sort of heavily

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,000
immersed in this world since 2018 now

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,960
and these are all sort of just my

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,480
personal uh experiences and feedback on

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,679
on these criteria so speed and

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
performance

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
uh in this modern web world with a

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,039
modern javascript framework you have

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,960
things like pre-loading and tree shaking

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,200
and critical rendering

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,919
and with a jam stack static builds and

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,200
cloud native serverless functions

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,440
and it is really hard to argue that

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,960
a traditional server side rendered app

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,080
is going to be faster than that

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,600
you can certainly build any javascript

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
app that is slower than any wordpress or

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
drupal set you've ever met but in the

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,159
right hands

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,919
you can do things and achieve lighthouse

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,120
performance scores that are very very

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,240
very difficult to do

00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:01,440
in in drupal or most other

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:05,360
traditional cmss uh flexibility

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,919
so i think this one is huge um

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,600
again we're data agnostic right you you

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,600
might choose drupal as your headless cms

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,679
but you're probably also talking to

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,720
apis and maybe a dedicated mongodb

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,960
database or an air table

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,480
for that matter you really choose where

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,159
your data is coming from and it doesn't

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,200
always have to go into drupal or your

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
cms

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,559
front-end diagnostic again i think this

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,559
is critical we're not just building

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,200
websites we're building

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
mobile apps

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,880
mobile-friendly web apps internet of

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,799
things display

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,399
experiences all sorts of things and this

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,399
idea that you can build your uh

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,960
own front end and choose whichever one

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,520
you love the best and put it on is great

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,279
and again this idea of choosing from one

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,200
of many tools to assemble the right tool

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,880
for the right job is very powerful

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
and while drupal of course is extremely

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,640
flexible i think it is arguable that

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,240
the modern web is even more flexible uh

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,320
user experience now this one

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,919
can be kind of hard to quantify but

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,679
again i think it's

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
generally when you're interacting with a

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,679
well that well-built javascript

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,520
application it's generally faster

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,360
it's more delightful it's the difference

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,200
between say an app like

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,200
netflix or instagram or any of the other

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
you know javascript-driven websites or

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,840
apps you use they just tend to feel

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,679
better and have nicer interactions and

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,799
frankly they can often be more

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,919
functional especially when you're

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,520
talking about things that are more

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,559
applications like you've got a

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,919
multi-page form or a

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,520
an interactive wizard that you want to

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,080
drive people through it's much easier to

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,120
become

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,159
more functional in this um modern web

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,679
approach uh developer experience now

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,200
uh i have a lot to say about this one

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
because again i've been developing in

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
drupal for

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,480
forever and uh for two or two some years

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,399
now in in the modern web

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,679
and again i give the edge to the modern

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,360
web here

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,760
if you haven't experienced it this idea

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,679
of component driven development

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,440
and i use that term loosely there are

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,720
react components of course

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,559
but again this idea of picking

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,399
components from the top all the way down

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,840
to your front end is very very powerful

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,880
and fun to work with

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,880
um single stack development i think this

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,720
one is also big maybe not so much for a

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
dedicated drupal developer but the fact

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
is

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,960
looking at those boot camp stan stats

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,159
and um

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,320
everything else that is happening in the

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,720
world it's very powerful to have a

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,760
single stack for your entire application

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,399
front and back and

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,480
and middleware um and this one is

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,159
subjective of course but i truly find it

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,760
more delightful to to build in this

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,679
environment it harkens back to that

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,279
uh renaissance period where we were

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,120
literally building everything by hand

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,720
and if you wanted something that looked

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
cool or did something you were

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,519
you weren't pulling a module off the

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,000
shelf you were sort of constructing it

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,039
and building

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,559
it and it's it's been great it's great

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,159
it's it's a it has

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,440
reintroduced a lot of joy to the

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:59,039
development process for me

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,159
and lastly overall cost i think the jury

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,640
is still out on this one

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
our agency has not yet launched enough

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
modern websites to have a

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,679
full picture of this but um from what

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
i've seen

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,039
and from what i hear others say i truly

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,760
believe that these three things are true

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,200
that we have

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,720
lower overall development costs

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,640
in that you are able to pick a lot of

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,919
these commoditized tools and services

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,720
and wire them together

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,880
in a way that i think can be much more

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,320
efficient than trying to

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,320
you know build the ocean out of a

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,720
monolithic cms

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,880
lower hosting costs especially in the

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
jamstack world if you are hosting on the

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,640
edge

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,320
you don't have a server to to run you

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,519
don't have to pay pantheon

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
400 a month or more to to run that

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
server

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,159
you have instead you might be paying

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,760
pantheon 50 a month for their base level

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
plan just to have your drupal site and

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,919
everything else gets pushed out

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,000
onto a global cdn and the cost of doing

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,279
that um frankly is almost zero

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,799
until you get a little bit popular and

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,120
then we start talking about things like

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,279
hey

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,279
25 a month it's very very um

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,360
efficient and fast and lastly this one

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,399
um i think this is true but i'm not

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,519
positive yet because i

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
we haven't been in this world long

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,120
enough but i do believe that the overall

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,720
support costs are lower

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,480
um in that you um

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
you know in a lot of cases someone else

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,880
is supporting your your authentication

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,799
or your

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,559
search um and all you're worried about

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,919
is that it works

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,200
so that all leads me to

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,559
this conclusion and that is that i

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,159
believe in the next 10 years

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,159
we are going to see a very sharp

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,799
reversal in the

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,519
cms market share slide that i showed you

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,320
earlier

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,600
again right now 61 percent of websites

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,360
are running some identifiable cms

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,039
um i believe over the next 10 years that

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,000
is going to absolutely flip on its head

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,000
and that 80

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,039
of the websites simply won't have an

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
identifiable

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,919
cms this by the way that earlier slide

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,000
came from what cms is this you're able

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,960
to sort of

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
see who's running what

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,200
so that's sort of where i see the world

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,320
going uh based on my

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,480
sort of two years in this world and um

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,040
it begs the question then why am i still

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,879
here why are we still here why are we at

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,800
drupalcon if this all this stuff is

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,079
really so great and so fast and more

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,599
cost effective

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,879
why are we here so

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,560
the uh sort of one of the key central

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,960
tenets of this modern web is that you

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
still need a cms

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
it's a integral in fact it might

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,639
probably will be the most important part

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,919
of your

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,399
modern web and that you still need

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,679
editors who can log in and add content

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,040
you still need

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,639
a place to store your content and

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,399
structure and model your content um

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,800
you know it's a key component of this

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,560
and as a result of that this huge giant

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,440
market has sprung up around the headless

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,159
cms if you go to a website called

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,359
headlesscms.org you'll see

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,560
these and dozens more there's open

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,079
source versions and

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,079
and uh private versions and

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,760
companies like contentful um which just

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,400
took in another huge investment in an

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,720
alvary that a billion dollars uh sanity

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,000
that i o just took a 3.5 million dollar

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,200
investment

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,800
um this this uh you know because the

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,760
headless cms is so central to this

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,200
modern web this

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
market just in the past three or four

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,160
years has absolutely

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,079
um exploded around this idea of hey

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,079
these people need a cms to to

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,280
manage their content

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,760
see do i still have my dressing on my

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
mic my phone sadly started ringing

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,920
[Music]

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,119
okay good hopefully you can't hear my

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
phone if you can it'll end here in a

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
second

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,400
i thought i turned my ringer off um oh

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,079
here's my phone right here okay so okay

00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,400
again giant uh headless cms market so

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,079
again if that's true and all of these

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,960
have been commoditized why

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,599
is drupal still relevant and i am here

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,760
to tell you

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,160
why and why i am still a huge believer

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:15,119
in drupal and it all starts back in

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,680
2016 drupalcon new orleans um

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,640
uh well before drupal 8 arrived and uh

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,720
during the state

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,480
of grupo the driest note which uh he

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,240
gave a great talk

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
earlier today that talked even more

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,320
about this initiative and

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,000
some of the javascript things coming up

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
in drupal but this was an actual slide

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,599
from that presentation api first

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,599
initiative

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,720
integrate with other systems bring your

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,760
content anywhere display it as you wish

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,800
that's exactly uh sort of uh what we're

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,240
talking about here

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,160
um and uh

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,000
in great testament to the drupal

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,520
community and the dozens and dozens of

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,640
developers who worked on that

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,920
uh what that led to uh just last year is

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,320
json api

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,760
landing in core and this quote was from

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,839
a greece blog post that said the most

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,800
feature complete and easiest to use json

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,240
api

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,640
implementation in existence we also by

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
the way

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,839
by at triple h's launch have a full rest

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,040
api and

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,240
we now have a graphql support um

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,599
so why does this matter um if you have a

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,960
drupal 8 set and you haven't done this

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,520
yet i'd encourage you to do so

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,400
it's a no configuration module you turn

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,760
on the json api module in a group late

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
site

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
and you're done you profit you now have

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,280
a feature complete backend that is

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
capable of powering any

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,560
modern front end and i'm going to show

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,160
you just real briefly like how that

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,760
looks in the real world

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,839
so you enable this module and you go to

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,599
the slash json api and the first thing

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,119
you're going to see is an output of your

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,520
site's content

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,760
okay if you don't know what to do with

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,760
that

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,800
whoops

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,800
you can start sending queries to that

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
json api so the slide that i have up on

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,920
my screen right now this is a real-life

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,839
json api and a real-life query from

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,560
a react app that we just built and um

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,440
it's

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,760
calling my my json api to retrieve a

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,280
bunch of data about a quiz

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,839
questions answers correct explanations

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,160
there's a video component to each quiz

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,400
um and

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,839
what that means is that on my front end

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,880
just with that simple query that i have

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,800
on the left i am now

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,320
have a drupal api that is talking to a

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
react app that is building this very

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,680
modern

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
um react based quiz if you if you're a

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,040
fan of the new york times they have a

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,200
great uh weekly news quiz

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,079
um they use felt by the way don't react

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,359
but

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,680
the idea is the same it's this really

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,520
sort of fun uh interactive quiz that

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,720
would be very very difficult to pull off

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,119
uh in twig or in jquery for that matter

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,079
or any sort of traditional

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,240
template language um here's another

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
example we use that same exact json api

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,480
this is

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
this unlike the last quiz example this

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,320
is a full-blown

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,000
gatsby site running a react front end

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
that is pulling all of its data its

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,599
menus

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,800
um everything from drupal and it gets

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,920
built and it's hosted on

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,480
it's hosted for free on that if i um

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,160
it uses algolia for search and some

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,040
really cool uh react

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,240
libraries for uh this find help tool

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
leads people through a series of

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
questions

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,880
and again some stuff that would be very

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,400
difficult to do in the modern

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,079
oh i'm running out of time here so i'm

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,119
gonna spin along

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,960
i get to talking sometimes um so

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,119
i wanted to throw this slide up uh this

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,520
is back to that weather.com

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,079
um and the economist if you continue

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,760
reading down that conference proposal

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,680
uh you will learn that they kept drupal

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,680
as a cms as another testament to why

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,280
drupal is still relevant in this world

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,800
they're on a node.js backend and they're

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,119
talking to other data servers and

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,520
they're

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,520
on a react front-end but if you go to

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,560
the weather.com and read an article that

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,560
data is coming from

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,280
drupal

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,359
so beyond the json api again drupal has

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
solved most of the hard stuff years ago

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,040
all of these headless cmss that i showed

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
um have not

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,599
um multilingual most of them don't have

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
it entity references most of them do but

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
it's pretty sketchy all of these

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,720
sort of things that we've worked as a as

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,359
a community to solve over the past few

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
years

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,440
are still solved and we still get that

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,000
great json or rest api

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,520
it's 100 free and open source most of

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
those examples that i showed earlier are

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,839
not and they

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
they all have free chairs but they get

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,359
expensive very very quickly

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,720
uh it's uh you can get up to you know

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,040
over a thousand dollars a month for

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,000
contentful without even thinking about

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
it

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,440
um and that's largely because they're

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,359
limited by records uh hey you can store

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,880
up to 20 000 records for this price or

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
rate limits like okay you can get this

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,000
many requests

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
those problems don't exist with with

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
drupal um we've solved all the problems

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,480
we have this great

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,760
json api and there's no record or rate

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,280
limits we can do what we want with it

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,760
and drupal of course is still

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,119
as flexible as it ever has been and it

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,640
uh works very very

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,400
nicely in this world um so what can

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,440
drupal do better i've got four minutes

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,359
left so

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,280
uh i think we'll be okay um

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,480
so this is all highly opinionated from

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,319
me um

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,839
i think and and if you didn't see

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,440
dresses keynote he talked

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,359
a lot about this today and where rupal

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,839
is moving but i think we need a

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,760
more modern admin ui and ux a lot of

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,760
these headless cms's do have these

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,839
gorgeous beautiful react-based or

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,240
javascript-based front-ends that

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,240
simply make drupal look and feel slow

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,599
most of these headless cmss and again

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,280
this is sort of that idea of

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,760
connecting pieces have have hosted

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,440
services so in today's world

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,800
you largely still need to have someone

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,640
responsible for setting up

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,960
drupal and managing and hosting it for

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,640
you i think it would be great if if

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,319
more people started offering hosted

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,599
drupal as a service similar to like

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,079
going and clicking a button on

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,920
contentful and and suddenly having

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,760
a drupal site to to connect to your

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,040
front end uh this one may be

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,599
controversial for any

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,800
long-term group of lights but the fact

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,720
is there's a lot in

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,560
in this model that doesn't get used in

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,640
drupal and i think it would be great if

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,640
we could at least explore this idea of

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,160
uh releasing an api first version of

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,119
drupal that doesn't have all the stuff

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
we don't need

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,480
i think that might help some developer

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,480
uptake

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,079
um if you've used wordpress lately you

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079
may have used gutenberg or if you've

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,720
ever used the go cms they both now have

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,400
these

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,079
what i i really came around on this it

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,720
took me a long time but these gorgeous

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
beautiful

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,760
editor interfaces especially for

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,359
building things like

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,640
landing pages that are much more modern

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,160
and easy to use than trying to do the

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,640
same thing and say the drupal paragraphs

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,280
module so there is a drupal gutenberg

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
module i've used it it's really coming

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
along great it still isn't quite up to

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,440
where

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,880
wordpress gutenberg is and frankly i

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,240
think wordpress gutenberg still needs

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,079
some work but this is where i see

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,079
the admin ui going and where i think

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,599
drupal could really compete

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
and lastly i think drupal needs to find

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,400
a way to get back into the conversation

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,680
if you are on twitter or listen to

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,119
podcasts or

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,839
or watch sort of what's happening in the

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,920
modern world with the modern web

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,960
uh frankly drupal is very rarely

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
mentioned most

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,160
people don't even know what it is these

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
days um in that world

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,839
and of course we all know that drupal is

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,200
this uh

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,560
very spectacular system so

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,480
okay i'm not gonna be able to finish

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,599
probably all these slides but this last

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,359
few minutes here is my highly

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,880
opinionated guide to the modern web if i

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,000
don't finish i'm not sure if i get if i

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,599
get

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,240
immediately cut off if i do all these

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,560
slides will be in my deck

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,599
but if you're interested in this here's

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,760
where i would go

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,119
so first of all if it was 2014 i would

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,560
have to explain a lot of very

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,000
complicated things to you and you would

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,839
have to go through an extremely

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,240
large learning curve just to even get

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,200
started um in 2020

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,040
2020 things that used to be higher are

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,160
now extremely easy and the cost of entry

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
into this world is

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,960
exactly zero it's all based on free

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,640
tiers and one-click demos and

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
automation and managed services and you

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,200
can jump into this world

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,319
instantly for no cost and very little

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,319
effort just to get started

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,400
this one may be controversial but if you

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,720
are coming into this green field

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,319
i would choose react mainly because it's

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,520
the still the most popular front-end

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,920
framework

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
um it's built into wordpress uh greece

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,200
talked today about

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,560
providing support for both react and vue

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,920
that said if you're if

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,480
you don't want to get into this react i

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,240
think is the way to go

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,640
if you are going to use react uh this is

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,079
a quote from a podcast in 2019 that i

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,480
listen to called syntax

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,960
fm i would never build anything in react

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,040
without choosing next or gatsby

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,720
these are two react-based frameworks

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
that both do very similar things

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,839
next however allows you to do

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,960
server-side rendering and static

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,920
rendering and i think here in july of

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,440
2020 this

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,440
still holds true

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,760
if you move into this world i would

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,680
choose one of these two frameworks

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,520
and now okay i have i wanted to make

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,280
sure i got to these next two slides

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,720
um i would encourage everyone here now

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,119
to forget everything i just said forget

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,200
about drupal forget about react

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,720
and simply go to sanity.io slash create

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,000
and from there if you have a github

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,599
account uh you'll have to create a

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,079
netlife account to

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,640
take the final step of host hosting this

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
and the

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,839
sanity account uh within about five

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,160
minutes you can have a fully modern

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,000
cms this is sanity that i o it's a

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,960
react-based cms

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,359
hosted on a global cdn that could

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,440
literally tomorrow handle millions of

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,760
views without you doing anything except

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,160
for paying a little bit of extra money

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,520
um running on a modern front-end

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,280
framework the first one you can see in

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,319
my sleep screenshot is a blog with

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,680
gatsby but there's

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,200
i think they have about six examples and

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
you could just do this and you'll have

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,119
your git repository

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,359
in this extremely modern site just to

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,880
play with

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,200
okay i'm just at time here so i'm going

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,400
to quickly finish up

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,160
after you do that i would highly

00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,440
recommend spinning up your own gatsby

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,680
site with

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,200
a drupal back end if you do that it'll

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,720
take you about one weekend probably to

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,400
learn and you'll at the end of that have

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,920
a basic understanding of react that's

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,800
how i started learning react was

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,640
drupal and gatsby a basic understanding

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,480
of graphql which is a new modern way of

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,040
querying data and getting it into your

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,960
front end

00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,119
you'll learn how the cms works in this

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,640
environment

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,640
if you push it up to detlify you'll know

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,319
how to host a fast scalable and secure

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,119
modern application hosted right on the

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,560
edge

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,240
and if you explore a little bit you'll

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,040
learn how to start pulling in data other

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,800
than

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,920
drupal so with that said i'm at time so

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,920
i think i'm going to

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,000
wrap up real quickly again these will be

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,680
on my deck

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,200
embrace the jam stack it truly is sort

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,520
of where i think that 80

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,280
20 is moving um things more and more to

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,079
the jam stack

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,480
um there's a huge ecosystem to explore

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,240
um

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,680
there's tech twitter if you follow any

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
three of these people

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,400
um you will immediately be sort of

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,440
immersed in this world and encourage you

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,040
to follow all of them

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,640
uh jesus who i know is in the session i

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,240
listed him he's he's been doing great

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,680
work in the gatsby

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,520
drupal world um podcasts uh there's a

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,160
great number of uh front-end podcasts

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,440
that

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,720
i listen to religiously um

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,160
and learning the fundamentals of

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,599
javascript you know this is uh

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,280
javascript still it's not like that you

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,520
get a free pass you still need to

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,960
learn the stuff and uh for me someone

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,280
who first learned javascript back in

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,440
2004 things have changed a lot and it's

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,960
important to learn it so

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
all right uh there are just a couple

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,559
slides left i'll just again they're

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,040
going to be on my deck but uh i very

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,160
