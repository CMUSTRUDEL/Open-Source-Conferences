[Music]

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
all right

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,440
i think it's time whoever arrived

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
arrived

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
welcome everyone so as you can see on

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,920
the screen

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,960
this is a working session there is not

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,880
going to be slides in this session

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,359
so if you came here to uh

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,279
get to know all the things about how all

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,320
these initiatives are going to happen

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,920
then my answer is we don't know so

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
that's why we are here

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,719
so there's not really much yet to

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,520
tell you in terms of content then

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,360
maybe so there may actually be some

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
stuff to tell you in terms of content

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
there's

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
a session on automated updates there's a

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
there's uh

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
several sessions on oliveira and they

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,680
were part of the

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,399
initiative leeds plenary earlier today

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
and there's a bunch of jubal.org issues

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
on drupal 10 readiness so there's

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
definitely

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
some stuff that we can talk about in

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,640
terms of what we already have

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,960
but the goal for this session is to have

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,479
a discussion so i would invite people

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,600
attending to come on over video and

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,840
um and ask

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,040
questions propose

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,520
ideas and do all kinds of fun things

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
so i will monitor my moderation panel

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,400
and the chat

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
try to take notes and everything at once

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,680
i made this screen like this so because

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,560
people will go

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
hop in and out of this session and they

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
may not have an idea of what we are

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,720
doing here so they will

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,600
get to know what we are doing here so we

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,439
have these

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,280
uh five components what i

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,280
ideally what i would like to do is to

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
prioritize with you

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
uh which one we are trying to talk about

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
first

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,840
so let's do a little experiment and

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
enter the letter

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,879
of the new initiative that or the

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,319
initiative that you want to start

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,200
discussing in chat and it will fly by

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,319
very fast

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:23,840
but i will try to see what people

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,840
want to discuss here

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,680
all right so we have 77 people on but we

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
had like 20 or so votes

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,720
so far and

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,280
most of them circle around a and b

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,680
with some distribution on the rest i

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,560
don't have a scientific way to

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,720
aggregate your chat messages so it needs

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,319
to be whatever my break and process

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,560
in time so that's what you got so

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,640
um all right uh do we have

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,599
people yet here from the ultimate

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,840
updates initiative

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,840
lucas heading was on the previous buff

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
in case they are here they didn't yet

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
said hi in the chat

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
now we could start with that but if

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
they're okay lukas is here

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,840
all right so we can lucas you want to

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
jump in here

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,680
i can let you in

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,840
all right so we can start about

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,840
automated updates then

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
hello

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,200
lucas arrived hi

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,519
we are not hearing you yet can you hear

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,239
me now yes

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
great helps when i turn the mute off uh

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
you'll have to give me context because i

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,479
just literally joined and someone said

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
my name and i said what huh

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,520
yeah this is the working session that we

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
are discussing the challenges and next

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,280
steps for these initiatives

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,960
for the ones that have not been started

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,639
i guess the next step is where do we

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,840
even start and how do we organize the

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
work and

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240
who's interested in taking part and for

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
initiatives like automated updates that

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
have a

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
rich history the question would be what

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,680
are your current challenges

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,759
focus areas and then we can get more

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,400
people on to discuss

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,120
if they want to be involved um i think

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
the current challenge is we've got lots

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,240
of great

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,120
uh inspiration and some ideas

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,479
um but a lot of these things are really

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,960
hard problems

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,039
that don't take five minutes or even

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
half a day to throw up a patch

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,160
but can require a great deal of time and

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
investment

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,800
okay so you would need dedicated

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
contributors basically that's yours

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
or at least someone to sort of wrangle

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,680
the the cats um

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
such that what limited time we have

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,479
we're spending it

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,039
efficiently is that

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,759
making sense like like someone to like a

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,759
project manager

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
i was hoping someone would smile and nod

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
because i think that's going to be a

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,919
common theme through

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,919
all of these initiatives yes yeah

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
okay good idea of what goals you're

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
trying to achieve

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,759
with a part of the commission or dude

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,080
help define lowe's as well

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:11,360
um i think we've kind of been

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
um we've kind of got a lot of those

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
goals

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,560
um we've got a working session scheduled

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,080
on friday

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
and i went through this morning and

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,000
documented them and then closed that tab

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,639
um but some of it is that

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
we need to move what was in contrib just

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
open up a couple of metas or something

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
and move

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
code over to core because we can take

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
the psa

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,000
code on the psas we can move over the

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,840
readiness checks

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,360
and start just pulling that into core

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:56,479
um we also need to work on an a b

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,479
front end david

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
had some initial poc work from a couple

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
of years

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,360
but it was kind of i would think

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,319
like david strauss's stuff is like

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
higher than

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:16,160
above all of drupal and so you know

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,919
that poc needs to be to work through

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
and then we've got something called

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,800
tough which is a

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
python framework that's gone through the

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,639
linux foundation

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,639
and some of their oversight committees

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,440
and it's a it's it would require some

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,199
some tweaks to how we are

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,199
implementing our current uh

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
secure tokens and hashing of the the

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,080
payloads for

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,120
our updates um

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,759
and we're doing a sprint uh some of you

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
guys will

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,039
be hopefully in attendance um in august

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
to try to realize some work there so

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,360
i think that's three things and i might

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,840
have missed a couple

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,759
that's great for goals and then you when

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
we talk about the initiative team itself

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
it sounds like

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
you've already got somewhat of a team

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
form yourself

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,199
are on it would you call yourself like

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
the lead developer or like what would

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,319
your role within the

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,960
team do i'm the lead developer

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
only because i had funding on the first

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,599
phase

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,520
and there's like 80 hours left

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
of that work um just sort of left over

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,080
so

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,760
you know two weeks and then i'm out of

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,959
out of work and

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,159
uh you know got to pay the electric bill

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,399
still so

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,640
um and no one's stepped forward so

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,800
obviously i'll try to stick around

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,160
but um and then david strauss and others

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
have sort of stepped forward with this

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
interest in tough

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,480
but there's not a strong lead right now

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
okay so we're lacking uh like an

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,160
initiative lead

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,839
or at least one with funded time to work

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,560
on this initiative is what i'm hearing

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,040
we're lacking project management help to

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
help kind of wrangle the issues and the

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
volunteers who want to see this happen

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,360
and putting them in a good place

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
um it sounds like we have your

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,320
experience

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
um as the lead developer the first phase

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
of this but we'll probably

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,880
we're gonna you know have to scale way

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
back on our expectations and around your

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,959
availability very soon

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,600
um and we have david strauss as kind of

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,480
a you know more of an architect position

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
um leading some of his broader stuff um

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,839
from

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,720
the perspective of tough um

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,680
right and and and tough is just going to

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
sort of replace some of the

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,080
infrastructure

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,160
around what's called csig the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,360
the client um signature that we're

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,040
attaching to

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,200
the the the the the tar balls

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,200
um um and and also we're

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
that tough stuff is not just a drupal

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
thing at that point it's

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,320
working with the type of three community

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
and the

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
um how escapes me the tip of my tongue

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
what's the other

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
joomla joomla community

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,279
so as far as the resources um at aquio

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
me and jess and alex and bronstein are

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
going to be able to

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
put some time in starting now or i guess

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
we're already putting time in

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
um and looking to hope help to move like

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
site readiness stuff into a core would

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
be sort of the first step

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,700
looking at the composer which i don't

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
think was covered in the um

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,959
[Music]

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,800
in the section before lucas had asked it

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,600
yeah it was okay um

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,880
so looking at yeah the composer is

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
composerifying

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,279
that the um making it work with composer

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
sites too

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,200
which lucas has started on too but

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,800
following up on that work

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
the composer install or update of let's

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
just say

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,079
of core

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,320
we we started some work on it and then i

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,480
followed a rabbit trail so we probably

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
80 percent of our work in the first

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,279
phase was getting this

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,399
this signature

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,079
infrastructure set up on drupal.org and

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,440
if we went with a 100

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,800
pure composer update we would

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,920
have to throw that all away uh which

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,920
seems very very sad

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
well not possible

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
it would it would be very sad for drupal

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
8 that we wouldn't be able to use any of

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,480
this client

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,680
um you know crypt cryptography stuff if

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,720
you want with pure

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,720
composer um so

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480
my my rabbit trail is to to work with

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
composer 2 project and we actually got

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
some changes into composer 2

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
that now allow us to intercept those

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,000
downloads

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,399
and so we can run the the the shaw sums

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,680
and

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,959
the comparisons um so then the next

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
phase would be

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,399
uh actually now going back and trying to

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,839
do like the composer update using

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,040
php um libraries so not calling the far

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
file directly but calling composers

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
uh internal api to do to initiate an

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,480
update

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
uh the benefit to all of what i just

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
said though is

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,959
when you look at the the performance

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,959
stats for composer 2

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
we're not going to be seeing all that

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,680
much memory utilization in all

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
likelihood

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
so it's a it's a it's a perfect scenario

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,360
for

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
folks that want to use composer uh

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
because they're gonna have to use

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,720
composer two to get the security

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,160
uh and composer two will also help them

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
reduce their their

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,079
their memory footprint so you know good

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
things in on all fronts

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,440
and that's where we left it yep

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
okay so i think uh benji had a great

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,880
question

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
and chat how many people in this session

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,160
consider themselves to be

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,200
pm's um

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,480
and in the video chat or in the

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,480
chat chat that's the question i think we

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
are not considering ourselves to be pms

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
i'm

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,639
happy to mentor people to get on

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
in terms of how to navigate the core

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
process

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,800
um that's what i that's my

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,720
the value i can add so i'm happy to

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,560
help people on board as a project

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
manager for automated updates or any of

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
the other initiatives

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,880
and basically all of them need project

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
managers so

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,560
i would say that all good lead devs

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,079
are also likely good project managers

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
yeah a lot of times people who would

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,120
prefer but they hate to do it

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
and they don't want to do it

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
yeah i mean i'm definitely interested in

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,160
helping shuttle a lot of the stuff into

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
core

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
i you know maintainer of settings tray

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
and layout boulder and

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,839
help to get those into core so i mean

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
i'm definitely

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
would be interested in and other people

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
helping with

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,959
with management i think we could always

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
use more help there but

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,720
while we're waiting yeah if i could

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,399
share a screen just for a second

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
um they both get shared and you have to

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
click on the other one anyway this one's

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,720
mine

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
um what we're effectively doing right

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
now is we're spinning up a whole bunch

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,040
of

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,560
new initiatives um and there's a section

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,199
on drupal.org called

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
the strategic initiatives page we list

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
all the ones this page needs to be

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,279
updated now

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,199
um but we list all the ones that are

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
currently in process each one of them

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,560
gets like this page

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,920
and the page has like here's a summary

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
of what this is going to look like when

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,600
it's all done

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,720
um here is a like bullet point list of

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
what this is going to do

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
here are the specific priorities that

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,480
we're working on

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
here's who we are and what role we're

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,000
feeling on the team

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,920
here's where to communicate with us um

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
here's how to get involved

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
um and we want to build a page like this

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
for each of these initiatives

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,680
because it helps out you know people not

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
in the core development community

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
understand what they're gonna get when

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,240
they're done with this initiative

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
um it helps the people who are

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
interested find out exactly what to

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
expect by

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
you know the time this is quote unquote

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,079
done it gives some actual faces to reach

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
out to if you're interested in

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
helping out um and it kind of goes like

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
that and so

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,160
that's why i'm wasting time drilling in

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,800
on these details because if you

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,440
could give us insight into what your

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,639
ideal

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,560
project team looks like um that is

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,040
really helpful because then we

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,720
can go find people to fill those roles

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
um and they're easier to fill those

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
roles

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,199
when we know and we can communicate what

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
it is exactly they're going to be asked

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,639
to do so it kind of

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
the the page format kind of goes top to

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,199
down like that it's like

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
explain what it is you're going to do

00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,279
here's specifically what that breaks

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
down to because

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,120
that makes it much easier for people who

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
want to take part

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
to have an understanding of what's

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,839
expected of them and what what what

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,079
their work is ultimately going to lead

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,800
to

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,800
if that makes sense

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,199
yeah so i think i heard ted say that

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
you're willing to take on some kind of a

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:28,240
coordinator yeah our lead developer

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:31,759
um i mean i'll be hopefully

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,279
full time for the next few months or

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,440
the rest of the year i have half time

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,839
too so

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,839
awesome

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,560
okay any final thoughts on this before i

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,199
move on to the next one although we

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,839
haven't

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:55,600
solved some of the problems

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:59,040
uh come to come to the the friday

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,120
session uh also like

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
we have a session diving in that i think

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
is going to be a great intro to

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
understanding the initiative

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,319
so if it's something that you you can

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,360
see yourself contributing to the session

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,959
would be a great way to get oriented

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
before this one

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
yeah i think this this also should be i

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,959
feel like this

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,240
work maybe uh like people who are

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,160
consider themselves pretty good

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,600
developers but not that familiar with

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,120
drupal i feel like there's a lot of

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,480
stuff that were

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,839
that you don't i mean obviously we'll

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,439
need people to know drupal but we'll

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
also need people who know composer

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
really well

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
and i feel like the av front loader

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
stuff is something we haven't done in

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
drupal so it's

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
not like you have to know an existing

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
system really well we're like sort of

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,919
proposing a new system so

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,480
and we've discussed making that the both

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
the front

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,960
the signing and the front loader

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,559
components that are not a part of drupal

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
that are maintained with other teams

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
that these both potentially might be

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
available to

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
other projects and other php projects in

00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:01,840
the community which google is also very

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,840
interested in us doing

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,280
okay so lucas in

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,480
chat also says that if we have uh

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,200
pm then they could start being very

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
useful

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,160
for two to four hours a week which is a

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,760
good estimate for anyone who's

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,120
uh looking at possibly recruiting pms

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,440
uh to help i think it's a good estimate

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,559
to get started on

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,520
stuff we can help uh mentor them i can

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,039
help mentor them

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,320
to make it very concrete and actionable

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,320
it's not the

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,760
best week but me personally i can help

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,039
them through them

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,320
okay uh let's move to

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
jf menu component then

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,919
that's a whole new initiative we don't

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,160
have a team we don't have leaders

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:11,840
we have some vision defined by drewce so

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,840
how do we go about that

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,840
so i think we've got some community

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,840
building around the initiative

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,840
so far over in slack

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,600
i think people are also offering stuff

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
john

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,600
you uh you shared that you've been

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
working on something very similar to

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
what

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,320
what was proposed i think um i don't

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
know if you wanted to say anything about

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
that

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,760
or if we should just focus more on the

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,600
um the process of

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,080
making an initiative that's new like

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,120
this official

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,160
yeah success would be good um i

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
like gabriel was just saying we've done

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
a couple different

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,840
iterations of a menu component

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,840
um some of you may know that i've done

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
menu block module like this right up my

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
alley of like

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,480
we've been doing a lot of react stuff in

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
amazing labs and basically recreated

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,080
something similar to that in react

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,159
but the more important for my

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,440
understanding

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,799
is um i haven't been following the uh

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,640
like the the admin uh

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,320
the previous initiatives that needed

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
this right so i don't know what their

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,000
criteria is

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,320
for wanting to get this in i just know

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,159
what

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,360
our criteria was for when we built this

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,559
thing so

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,320
um i think that um

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,400
can be part of the you know in this

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,919
whole once we have like

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,120
leadership and like that would need to

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,400
be something that needs to be

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,120
understood from uh people who are

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
involved

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
like sally and

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:03,840
what is the pitch initiative what is the

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,840
elevator pitch i missed it

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,600
i think the the the elevator pitch is we

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,440
want to put a stake in the ground

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,799
um where drupal provides

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,480
official react view

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,679
foo components built with javascript

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,559
and that that process should get the

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,000
ball rolling

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,559
on further work from the drupal

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,760
community

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,240
in that space and ideally those

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,679
components should make the the decoupled

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,360
experience whether you're a

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,799
site builder an end user or a

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
front-end developer who maybe doesn't

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,400
know drupal or php

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:51,440
have a better development experience

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,440
with drupal thanks

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,919
i think that another really important

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,200
thing for this initiative is that

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,280
um we need to have uh

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
relief management framework management

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,720
and security

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
um stakeholders involved from the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
beginning this there's a lot of

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,679
implications

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,679
that this changes you know all a lot of

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,840
expectations we have both because of

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,520
how the you know how the current job is

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,720
with ecosystems dependency management

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
works and

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
um you know the the expectations we have

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
around maintainership there's a lot of

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
governance stuff so i think that it's

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
important to start early in management

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,039
by having conversations

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,720
about those kinds of things yeah

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,640
yeah how do we how do we tread water in

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,679
the javascript pool

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,200
we know php really well we know our

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,039
dependencies like symphony

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,280
but node is a different

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,159
beast we just code is distributed very

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,520
differently right

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,120
va npm um

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,360
using a package manager for our

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,159
production season course which has

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,200
you know is is that a problem and larry

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
from there before that that would be a

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
lot of work to change

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,720
um so gabor angie

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,320
um maybe you could tell us

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
what you know how do we go about

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,400
formalizing

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
a new initiative if if people are on

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
board i think

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
it sounds like people are but we

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,760
probably want to give them opportunity

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,600
to you know shoot holes in the

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,280
elevator pitch that's actually one of

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
the things i'm most interested in i was

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
hoping that we would hear a lot of that

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
i think we have started to use feedback

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
from the dries note

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,240
like you know does the actual is this a

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,320
good way to start

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
um because dries you know have the idea

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,960
but i i would i think that

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,720
maybe this is a place where like maybe

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
the ideation process could help us if we

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
put

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,320
really invest some time in like

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,840
promoting the idea and trying to get

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,640
community feedback on

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,840
on you know like a time-boxed discussion

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
on whether there's a better direction we

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,159
should go

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,200
you know i feel like

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,559
i know historically javascript has

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,320
always been hard for us because we're

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
php developers but

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
you know i think dries and his slides

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
even kind of showed that

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
in general nowadays in the last couple

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,840
years there's a lot more javascript

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,799
developers entering the

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,279
entering the space just in general and i

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,120
feel like i've seen

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,039
in the last couple of years a bigger

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,880
split between front end and back end

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,360
drupal devs to where front ends are

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,200
using

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,200
components and design systems and all of

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
that now and and i think a lot of those

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
people maybe have historically

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
not contributed back to the drupal

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
project because they think of it

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
drupal's php and they work at agencies

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
and they do custom themes when they do

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,880
custom javascript that way so

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,080
um i mean i know we've got several front

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,520
end devs in my organization that i think

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
would be happy to contribute back to

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,200
drupal if we could find a way for them

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
to do it with their skill set

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,799
which which might not be php heavy but

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,640
would definitely be

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,200
javascript and component and react and

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,039
view heavy um

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,480
that's really a trick you know how do we

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,000
how do we find those people that are

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,039
already working on front end

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,240
drupal stuff and get them to contribute

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,240
back if they haven't been

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
yeah i think that so i put in i put in

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,600
blank text to stick in the ground

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
because i'm a i'm an old head back-end

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
developer but you know

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,080
the so that's why we want to put a stake

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,120
in the ground to

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,960
uh to show that we want to go here and

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
to and i think it's also important to

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,000
set a

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,480
um a goal that is accomplishable

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,400
that's why it's i mean on the surface it

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,320
doesn't sound very inspiring that you

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,200
have a javascript menu component okay

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,039
well whatever but um but it's an

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
achievable step that we can then build

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
on

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
i think that's the idea to show that we

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,799
can

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
we are committed to this and we can ship

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,480
something much faster

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,580
than if we would have like boil the

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,320
ocean and redo everything

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,720

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
i'm sorry

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,960
i think i was talking over angie

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,760
so maybe it was echo um yeah i was going

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,880
to say that it

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,679
since it's the the actual technical goal

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
whatever it is

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,360
is self-contained um we might also find

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
out

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,159
as a result of doing that that oh maybe

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,440
this isn't the right way maybe we should

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,799
go a different direction and especially

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
if it's something we complete in a short

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,400
amount of time

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,400
um we'll get those answers sooner

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,840
okay that goes on my end

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
no no i think it's someone else if

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
everyone else could just mute when

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,360
they're not talking

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
i think it was anne i tried to unmute

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,240
because i was going to talk but then

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,000
john talked to the saints

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,279
okay okay um uh yeah i was going to say

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
that i actually think

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:04,000
a menu component is pretty pretty good

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,159
um component to start with it it's not

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
an easy component to write um we've done

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
it a few times in may the labs and

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
like so there's a there's some hidden

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
sort of complexity you think like oh it

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,840
should be straightforward but like

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,679
the way that we render menus to do like

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
all these different things inside react

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,279
application to be able to do a lot of

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,399
different things

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,520
um and that makes the code not

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,600
straightforward

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,200
um and it

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,120
like like teresa was saying you know it

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,039
is going to require us to think about

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,399
uh authentication and like who has

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,279
access to those

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,279
menu items even if the the menu

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,799
even if this the way i envision the code

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,840
it's

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,919
more atomic then

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,360
uh it would it would just be about

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
rendering the menu items but we would

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
still need to

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,039
think about how do we do that with like

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,399
authentication

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,200
and um and uh

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,080
authorization right because that stuff

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
has to be

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,520
worked out so that the the menu

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,120
component itself

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,080
can render what it's been given right so

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
it touches on a lot of things that are

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,240
not

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,880
super easy but would be super uh

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,640
helpful for developers who want to like

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,039
oh great we've got this stuff already

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,039
handled

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
i'm i would love to hear other people's

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,840
ideas of different things but like

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
it made a lot of sense to me

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,480
okay so that's the so i think jess's

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,880
point about doing an exploration of a

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,559
little

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,279
exploring this idea a bit more and then

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,360
come back with whether that made sense

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,360
i think sounds sounds reasonable

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,360
um i asked an earlier question about

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,120
what's the process for becoming an

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,640
official initiative so i was gonna

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,640
just show that real quick

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,480
so um there's this queue called the

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,919
drupal core ideas queue

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,320
at drupal.org project ideas we have this

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,320
helpful flow chart that gilroy himself

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,039
made as far as i understand

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,640
um and this is only for kind of bigger

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,960
initiatives you don't have to do this

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,880
for

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
you know i want to fix up typo somewhere

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,080
or whatever but the idea is you

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,760
post an idea to the ideas queue everyone

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,440
says yay it's a great idea so then you

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,880
build a prototype and you do a plan you

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,159
kind of iterate on this and once the

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,399
emission is approved

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
then you go into the actual core queue

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
and you start building and happily ever

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,120
after and stuff like that

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
um which is very waterfall i'm not

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,080
saying it's a great

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
necessarily way to do it but it is a

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,799
process that we have so we have this

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,360
ideas queue

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,480
in here you can find all kinds of crazy

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,240
ideas that people have

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
um some have a billion comments some

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,919
that don't but just like any other

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,279
issue in any issue queue you can have

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,880
discussions on these

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,039
edit the issue summary which is the main

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,000
template and eventually get the thing up

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,880
to rtbc and once it gets to rtbc

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,559
or uh reviewed and tested by candy then

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,039
the product managers are able to achieve

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,520
it

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
we have an initiative template here um

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,480
which basically has some you know

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,240
background why are we doing this what's

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
the problem we're trying to solve

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,080
what is the solution that we want to do

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,320
here's where to find the process

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,679
a roadmap we don't need this to be like

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,919
as detailed as like

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
you know every single detail of every

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,960
road map but the idea of sketching

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,960
out what it is that you want to

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,240
accomplish talk to us about what's not

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,520
in scope that's gonna be really

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,279
important for this initiative so it

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,679
doesn't try to take on the whole world

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
any related work existing core features

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
and so on

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
um you don't necessarily have to fill

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,159
out this whole thing but it's really

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,919
helpful because

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,360
it if you can answer these questions you

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
get out in front of a lot of things that

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
are going to

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,840
hurt you later on if you don't so for

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,840
example one of the things that we talk

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,480
about is what the team what resources do

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,799
you have

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,679
what sign-offs are you going to need in

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
order to

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,120
do your thing you know like just

00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
mentioned release management security

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,440
sign-ons

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,760
we need some plan around how these

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
components are going to be maintained

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,880
how they're going to jive or not with

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,919
the drupal uh you know

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,240
release process that kind of thing so um

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,640
so that would be my recommendation is is

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,039
as you're doing this discovery work

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
um and you're trying to figure out you

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,760
know whether or not the the

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
proposal as is is good if it needs to be

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,799
modified or whatever

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
collaborate together on one of these

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
issue summary template kind of things

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,200
and

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
and and go forth and fill out the blanks

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
and then that gives you a stake in the

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,000
ground to be able to have a wider

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,919
conversation with the community to you

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,679
know find out details you're missing

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,200
uh maybe other things we want to try to

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,760
plot later in the roadmap that kind of

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,080
thing

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,880
and then through that process of kind of

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,720
deliberation

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,919
get it up to rtbc and then it would be

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,679
escalated to

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,279
uh one of the product managers which is

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,000
myself rory

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,399
dabor or dries and we would be able to

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
to

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,600
you know basically say yeah this looks

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,080
great there's also

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,880
um there's two kinds of initiatives

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
there's the

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
strategic initiatives which dries in

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
consultation with

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,799
community stakeholders has said you know

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,159
these things are most

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,240
important for the health and future of

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,679
drupal right now um

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,760
and but then there are also community

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,279
initiatives which are

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,279
uh just things that people in the

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,880
community have collaborated around

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,360
and are working on so an example of this

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,240
during the triple a cycle was um

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,480
uh there we had a dependency on simple

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,120
tasks when we shipped drupal 800

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,200
and a group of contributors who really

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,799
cared about fixing our testing

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,640
um worked together to um switch

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
and convert drupal's test to php unit

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,960
that wasn't an official strategic

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,279
initiative

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,559
um it was extremely beneficial in the

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,720
long run and it

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,720
makes you know made everything easier

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,880
for

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,559
um so that that went through something

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,720
like the process angie

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,559
suggested but it's not it you know it

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
doesn't need like

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,840
dries official approval for people to

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,600
work on things that they're interested

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,360
in the communities always you know

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
if you are interested in something give

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,600
it a shot and try and

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,039
um if it turns out through this ideation

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,799
process we're like whoa this is

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,840
important then we can you know help you

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,840
promote it and get more

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
involvement

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,320
just in general what i find really

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,320
refreshing is

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,840
and i'm sure it's by necessity but that

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,279
this uh

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,559
initiative chooses to find the smallest

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,679
sliver

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,880
of uh um uh

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,840
proof of concept of uh and just the

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,840
smallest

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,880
thing that we can get to actually

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,679
surface

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,559
i think i mean that's unique and that's

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,399
something to be

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,120
guarded because

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,840
this will have eyes on it and people are

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,720
already asking why not angular

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,799
we need need to get that first thing uh

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,039
whatever i don't know it's i think

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,440
proofs of concepts are already in place

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,000
right

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,279
from what i hear uh john's saying i've

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,919
written a couple

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,039
in that sense uh we need to get a proof

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,800
of

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,000
core viable concept or whatever um

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,480
but yeah before we can even ask a

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,760
project manager to manage this

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,560
we need to uh clearly guard and sign off

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
on that

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,839
smallest possible scope to to learn what

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,839
we need to learn

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:35,440
who who's the one to rtbc

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,440
um the ids issue queues

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,720
not the ones proposing the idea when

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,320
they think that it's ready for feedback

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,240
from the

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,079
product manager gotcha with you

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,079
when you think that you completed these

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,919
like what it was my team

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,280
which kind of sign ups i think this will

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,399
need one is my rough

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,399
road map that kind of thing

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,000
so you don't need uh i mean the

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,480
initiative doesn't

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
need external stakeholders necessarily

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,440
to plan it out

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,040
then your external stakeholders will

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,880
come in and

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,880
rip it to pieces advisable

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,000
before you actually see it

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
did they just it was literally oh sorry

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,839
i was saying it's it's it's definitely

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
dabo are saying it's not a requirement

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,240
to have

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,560
um you know sign-offs and and external

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,640
reviews before you get the plan to rtbc

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,720
but it's a good idea

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,720
if you're like working on something with

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,160
one other person it's helped it can help

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,079
flesh out your plan to get feedback from

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,760
someone outside first so it's

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,760
a good idea even if not required

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,880
all right so we spent 35 minutes on

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,599
these two

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,160
and we have 10 more minutes left for one

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,480
of the

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,440
three remaining probably and i'm gonna

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,320
have more time

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
to dive into more so i would call for a

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,839
vote

00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,839
again

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,079
in the in the chat the polls only

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,280
so what which letter is what which is

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
drupal 10

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,839
on the screen that i am sharing it's

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
very similary

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
okay

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,640
it kind of all looks like everything by

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,839
far

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,839
okay n let's talk about drupal 10

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,560
you want me to yes so what what are the

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
questions like sorry i missed the first

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,079
four minutes because

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,880
this is a it's easy to get disrupted at

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,839
home

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,839
um

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,520
so what were the questions to answer i

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,119
can't read your

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,960
slides even if there were questions i

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,359
think okay so

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,000
uh as you heard in the degrees note um

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,200
we have

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,040
until drupal 9 3 alpha 1

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,119
at the very very latest to add or

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,960
any new functionality that needs to be

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
in drupal 10 and that includes required

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,280
functionality

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,160
so for example in order to

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,240
update from ck editor 4c category 5. we

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,960
determined the best way to do that

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,400
would be to add an experimental module

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
to drupal 9 core

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,240
that implements c character 5 because

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,040
there's such a big bc break between the

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,119
two

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,160
um and then work on that refine it get

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,079
feedback

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,160
and make it a stable module so that then

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,320
in drupal 10 we could

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,800
or in preparation for drupal 10 we could

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,960
deprecate ck editor 4 and then make ck

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,400
editor 5 the official core module

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
and there's lots of things like that for

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
basically anything you want to add to

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,040
core for this magical

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,160
continuous upgrade path that makes

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,680
everything so easy um it's important

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,160
earlier in the process so um 9-3

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,079
is like a year and three months from now

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,240
is the alpha deadline for it

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,599
uh so we need to get started now um and

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,200
i'll kind of run down

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,040
what i think the top five things are

00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,920
that are at risk that need work right

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,960
now

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,400
um that are hard requirements so uh

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,240
and that we can start not easily so one

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
of the biggest risks is related

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,079
to um we're we're trying to go not only

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,079
to symphony five but to symphony six in

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,839
order to get out of this trap

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,599
of having like having to do a major

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,760
release every two years

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
and that's going to require first of all

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
that requires us to be symphony 5

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,640
compatible which we

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,480
almost are we have like one critical

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,560
issue left which is very exciting

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,160
but then after even once drupal 9 is

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,599
compatible with symphony 5

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,000
we have to keep up with all of the

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,800
deprecations in symphony 5

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,839
in order to adopt symphony 6 and we

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,359
might have

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,440
in order to make the expose those

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,200
deprecations to drupal 9 users so they

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,359
can have a continuous upgrade path

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,560
we might have to do some kind of ugly

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,160
stuff in order to surface those

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,680
deprecations or at least we need to come

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,680
up with a process for it

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,680
so that's um i'm sort of going back in

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,839
the front and that's one important area

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
another important thing for both drupal

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,000
8 and

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,839
through drupal 8 through drupal 10 is

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,160
our php 8 compatibility

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,240
the sooner that we are fully compatible

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,119
with php 8 the sooner that we can sort

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,440
of

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,240
push our upstream components to make php

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,320
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,520
compatible versions available the better

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,280
off it will be

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,920
because um the hp 8 is going to

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,839
dribble 10 will require at least phpa

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,359
and obviously we want our other

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,520
releases to be compatible with that as

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,359
well starting ideally if we could with

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,960
the release of 9.1

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,880
so there's there's a great meta issue

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,640
right now that has lots of bugs in core

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,079
that need fixing for php that's a great

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,720
place to get started

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,119
um and it's it will also acquaint you

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,839
with

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,839
sort of

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,000
i think we lost just here but there's a

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,960
meta issue for php eight there's people

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,119
been exploring

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,599
running uh drupal 9 with php8

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,680
and there's some promising things there

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,440
but we need all of our dependencies

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:11,280
of course to update

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,280
so that's it for php 8

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,960
and now we are getting catch

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,960
on maybe

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,760
did i just get ready that was weird oh

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,880
she's better

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,040
where did i get dropped sorry we

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,040
finished off php eight okay cool

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,319
um that was sucky especially when we

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,079
have like three minutes i thought the

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,240
session ended or something was strange

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,599
uh so uh big thing number three ck

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,800
editor which i just mentioned

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,960
um if the there's we might have a time

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,400
box discussion about which editor is

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,440
best for drupal

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,119
um i and wim who's the person who wrote

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,319
the ck editor for integration

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,720
both feel that uh it might be

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,920
we're very short on time to go with a

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,319
totally new solution

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,160
um but that's that's a discussion we

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,760
need to have like this month is whether

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,760
we go ahead with seek editor five or

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,560
whether we want to pursue

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,760
a different wysiwyg for drupal 9 a

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,480
triple 10.

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,000
um it's going to take a long time

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,680
requires a lot of work

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
it requires javascript knowledge it

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,160
requires drupal knowledge

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,839
and it requires uh you know

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,720
collaborating with upstream the ck

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,920
editor team in the past

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,920
has worked really well with us and

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,359
they're willing to make fixes for things

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,680
that are bugs and drupal

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,400
um so that's that's a great opportunity

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,640
and we would love

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,079
anyone who's like has both php and

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,800
javascript knowledge to help us out with

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,079
that

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,599
and then the fourth thing

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,599
uh we're also looking at jquery 4

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,960
coming out probably some time before the

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,240
release of drupal 10

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,079
which puts us at risk because uh

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
like i don't know if anyone remembers

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,119
drupal 84 and how much it broke all your

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,119
sites

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,119
but what we did in drupal 84 is we had

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,480
to do a major update of jquery in a

00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,280
minor release and we don't want to ever

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,319
do that again

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,640
so jquery 4 adds a lot of risk

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,400
um for us because we have all these

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,960
dependencies that depend on jquery will

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,440
they be compatible with jquery 4 in time

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,400
there's mountains of code in of jquery

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
code and core and so

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,119
one sort of like side initiative that

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,640
it could be its own standalone thing and

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
i would love to see people sprinting on

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,480
is to

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,480
convert existing jquery in core legacy

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,839
jquery from like 10 years ago

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,440
into native javascript there's a lot of

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
patterns that

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
you know even 10 years ago could have

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,480
been done without jquery but it as

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,520
javascript has evolved as language

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,040
there's a lot of things that we can do

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,520
that do not require jquery

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,040
so um again javascript contributors this

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,400
is a place that's sort of easier to get

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
involved um we're going to do some

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,960
planning

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,440
around you know what's the most

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,400
important how do we go about

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,079
removing jquery and core making issues

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,760
for reviewing them and so forth

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,440
um but i think this is a great a really

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,720
sprintable thing because like it's it

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,040
can be a matter of like

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,119
look through call core of all of pattern

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,400
x and just replace with pattern y

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,680
and we started talking about what some

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
of the most important things are for

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,440
that

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,800
and then thing number five um not a hard

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,359
requirement but i think is very

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,319
important

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,839
is if there's anyone here who's a theme

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,440
developer

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,040
you might have had the opportunity

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,800
earlier to attend larry's session about

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,880
the starter kit initiative

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,640
um the starter kit is basically it's a

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,599
replacement for classy

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,640
classy we wanted to deprecate classy in

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,480
drupal 9

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,240
but we're not able to because we didn't

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,240
have a replacement for it yet and classy

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,680
would give us that replacement

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,079
um this is sort of uh

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,520
it's not a hard security requirement for

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,200
the release of drupal 10 but in order

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,960
for our themes to be maintainable in the

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
long term and in order to not have to

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,359
have

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,119
stable eight in core for the next 10

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,800
years um

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,240
we we need that replacement so theme

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,839
developers if you're interested

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,800
talk to lowry please and go to buff

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,000
tomorrow apparently

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,160
all right i think i'm done those are the

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,720
most important things right now um

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,960
we have a giant road map of stuff that

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,000
has rough details and i can

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,119
we can put your link in anywhere if you

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
go to

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,640
uh or if you just search search google

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,880
search drupal.org for

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,240
june 2022 release triple count in june

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,920
2022 you'll get the issue that way

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,440
that's how i find it usually

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,800
so i suggest and that too

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,839
since you're here on the symphony six

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,800
um so when drupal 10 comes out

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,480
symphony would be on six one i think

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,160
would be the most recent release

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,160
which is only going to have nine months

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,280
of support yep

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,599
um so there's a solution to that we we

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,599
negotiated extra security coverage

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,280
with the symphony team so two of the

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,480
drupal core framework managers who are

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,160
on the security team are also on

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,640
symphony's security team

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
and um when there is a security issue

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,960
for

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,040
uh 600 or 61 um then

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
the we will work with symphony to create

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,200
a back port release for it for our needs

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,440
um okay yeah and so we go ahead

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,760
sorry i'm just thinking out loud so we'd

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,880
release 10.0 on 6.1

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,680
and then we'd release 10.1 on 6.2 and

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,480
etc until until we get up to 6'4 yep

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,640
okay

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,079
thank you and we we sort of we we looked

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,880
back at our previous releases and there

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,640
were like

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
there's like maybe one or two in the

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,720
history of drupal 8 where we might have

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,960
been

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,920
in that window um notably 2018.005 we

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,280
could not

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,400
um symphony 4-3 was out of security

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,200
coverage

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
and so we we were kind of stuck there in

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,200
order to create a back port

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,319
for eight fives but we we've addressed

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,680
that now so

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,680
right okay thank you

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,560
thanks matt and benji

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,160
and with that our official time is up

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,079
but we can continue discussing whoever

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,280
is still available until we get kicked

00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,480
out

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,839
anyone else have any questions about

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,839
triple ten

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,520
let me look at the chat

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,760
lots of excitement about jquery out i i

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,920
hope to see you all

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,880
in did we even make gabor have we made a

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,000
drupal 10 table

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,640
no we should we should i was hoping

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,560
there was

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,000
hopefully going to be like a symphony

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,440
table or something

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,440
but there may be two specifics

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,040
but we can we can

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,760
it's better marketing right yeah for

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,640
starters or you could make the title

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,240
drupal 10

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,839
and kill jquery so i have questions

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,640
about the zk

00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,520
yeah so what is the next step on the cka

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,040
editor

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
uh issue because i feel like we need a

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,040
decision on the uh

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,040
like are we gonna continue with ck

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,240
editor or go with something else

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,359
so but um i i also tried to bring this

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,960
up in the last committer meeting but

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,680
unfortunately it was at a time

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,800
when neither product managers were there

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,560
um

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,319
i think that we need to have a uh

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,720
first of all i think we need to have a

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:14,240
discussion with with dries with angie

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,319
with wim myself lowry um

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,599
about whether or not we we do want to

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,440
even consider

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,040
another editor and then if we do want to

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,599
consider a different editor i think then

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,680
we need

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,280
like product management to have like a

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,640
time box window for feedback

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,319
and that needs to go through the product

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,280
review process because this is a really

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,839
important

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,440
content editor spacing feature it's a

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,839
big part of drupal's

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,520
experience so like we already know that

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:40,319
ck editor

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,000
for past our requirements and the

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,680
question is do all these editors

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
meet our product and release management

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,520
concerns along with all the technical

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,760
things that we'd be concerned about

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,200
um so like you know question one is do

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,960
we even consider it because if

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,800
people can all still create if they want

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,720
to create a gutenberg model go do it

00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,640
you know we have contrib um

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,839
so i'm i'm i'm torn on that but i think

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,160
it's ultimately

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,760
you know a product decision whether we

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,800
make the consideration and then we need

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,200
a product process

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,319
for picking a different editor if we're

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,079
going to go that way

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,400
ck editor has on the other hand has a

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,800
plan written out based on

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,079
ck editor as of a year ago um there will

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,680
probably be additional things that we

00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,800
discover if we once we actually started

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,200
one

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,480
just uh the um i don't i can't speak to

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,680
their product managers how i'm going to

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,680
think about that is the

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,200
impact that it has on content authors

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,720
versus the effort that it's going to

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,960
take to replace it

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,000
um and replacing it means we need it to

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,240
pass the accessibility

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,160
gate we need it as the usability gate

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,280
remember that when we replace an editor

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,400
all of the documentation training video

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,680
being created is to be done so if we're

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,240
going to switch to a different editor

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,480
it's got to be

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,920
very compelling from my point of view i

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,200
know ck editor 5 supports like

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,480
collaborative editing and stuff like

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,880
that that's cool like

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,760
some some kind of really neat carrot we

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,920
get with the

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,760
change of an editor could possibly sway

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,160
it but like it would need to be

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,760
very compelling and there need to be a

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,200
solid plan behind how we're exactly

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,400
going to do it because we have less than

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,359
two years to get it done

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,000
well we have it's like it's basically a

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,000
year and

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,839
and we we want we need the replacement

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,640
to be in core

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,040
ideally like in nine two if it's if it's

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,359
not

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,119
if we don't have a module that's beta or

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,599
stable in nine two we're in a really bad

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,079
spot

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,520
so we have to encourage this in general

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,040
any of these kind of things if you have

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,839
a great idea and you want it to happen

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,599
for core

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,280
get it happening contribute first

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,119
because several of our most successful

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,640
initiatives json api

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,800
you know all these different ones have

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,520
have done that path so if you really

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,319
like the

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,079
smoothie booby editor um go make a

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,960
swoopy boopy module get it working

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,839
really well

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,359
then you can showcase hey awesome it is

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,359
that is a much easier

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,680
cleaner path to core than hey i found

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,280
this cool javascript library in github

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,079
let's add that decor does that make

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,559
sense yeah i'm somewhat concerned

00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,800
for that though with the may end up like

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,800
the

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,440
like the like the theme theme contest

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,800
when we had the theme contest and that

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,720
was like three

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
working on the theme and then we only

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,800
got one

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,960
so that's a problem because uh based on

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,440
the time limitation that we have

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,240
i don't think we can build their editors

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,800
and then only one gets done unless they

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,559
are

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,400
totally happy with having a contribute

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,400
that may or may not end up anywhere

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,000
i think you want a firm statement from

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,920
product management that either

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,440
yes we're considering other editors at

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,200
this time or no we are definitely not

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,800
considering other editors at this time

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,319
first and then from there is that

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,839
yeah i think i also think that the

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,280
documentation and the video

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,119
that is uh is a needs to happen either

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,040
way because security 5 is quite

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
different from security f4

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,079
in terms of what it offers how it

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,599
integrates the developer

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,839
experience is totally different the

00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,319
country modules will need to be written

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,640
they will need to they will decide on

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,000
how new uis that want to integrate with

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,200
ck editor because they need to be

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,559
rewritten anyway

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,400
and so it's gonna escalate either way

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,839
yeah that's fair i guess you know once

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,280
again i just asked people keep the

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,960
content authors in mind these are the

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,640
poor victims of drupal who didn't have

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,680
any choice over what cns they have to

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,280
use every day

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,040
they're the people who have to use this

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,640
so that's the lens through which

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,079
when we're evaluating which solution we

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,480
go with that's the lens we need to be

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,480
looking at

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,559
i saw dries in the chat actually

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,319
dries do you have thoughts and opinions

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,160
on this

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,920
is he still are you still here yeah

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,480
andres was listening i mean he was

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,400
listening and it was in the chat

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,640
all along it did not come on video

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,640
though

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,839
maybe typing or not we don't know

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,800
um another question in the chat so is it

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,480
practical to support ck editor four and

00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,839
can trip for is a question from ruth

00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,960
that's a great question i've thought

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,559
about this as well

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,000
um what i think that we would do is i

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,280
think that we would move the ck

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,200
editor for module into contrib

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,319
but it would not have security coverage

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,000
because the synth

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:16,319
or the uh what's their faces

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,760
um the ck editor team is going to stop

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,240
providing security coverage for it at

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,200
the end

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,640
of 2023. we negotiated that date with

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,040
them actually that's another thing

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,720
that's

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,960
really in secretary's favor is that we

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,359
have good relationships with them and

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,760
they

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,640
already extended first drupal 9 they

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,400
extended

00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,480
ck editor for's end of life from the

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,720
beginning of 2022 to the end of 2020.

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,319
whatever year that is 2020 the one where

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,599
drupal 9's end of life

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,319
um so that

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,119
that's a it's a great question and so it

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,319
would have security

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,839
like the module would have security

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,960
cover because drupal 9 remember is

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,960
supported at the same time

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,160
drupal 10 is released and dribble nine

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,760
four is released at the same time and

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,319
has another 18 months to support after

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,160
that

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,160
so see would be we would be maybe

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,119
providing security coordinated security

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,599
releases or

00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,880
contrib module up until the end of 2023

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,440
and at that point that module would

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,119
either go

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,119
no security coverage or unsupported

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,559
let's see another question or another

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,160
thing from the chat mike says the

00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,680
type hinting in symphony five and six is

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,400
going to be another pain point yes i

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,880
agree

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,440
um we've already had to do horrible

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,000
things

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,280
for that related to the php unit and we

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
might have to do horrible things for

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
that for

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,480
a lot more of core we'll see what

00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,480
happens here

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,480
yeah yeah scott i agree that legacies

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,480
support

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,880
legacy support for and edit and place

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,000
changes

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,280
uh yes yes they're very different

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:55,839
which is why we're writing a different

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:56,880
module i understand the statement

00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,160
know that we're hanging out in our

00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,760
overtime here does anyone else have

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,240
questions about

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,079
ten excited about

00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,839
i i love that we're going straight into

00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,040
this after drupal 9 because it means we

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,400
already have a lot of people who know

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,319
what it's like to deliver a major

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400
release under a new process and so

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,240
are exciting and have knowledge i like

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,760
that it kind of sucks from

00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,520
like a product standpoint because we

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,359
can't work on as many you know

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,640
user-facing improvements but i

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,359
i i do like continuing your moments

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,359
making faces

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,960
i'm excited too let's make a drupal 10

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,440
group gabor and

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,559
and then we'll invite people to it on

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,480
the open social

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,079
yeah i was looking at whether i can

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,000
create it but i'm looked out of that

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,799
site now but i will create it as soon as

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,920
i can you

00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:49,359
yay thanks i have questions on the easy

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,359
out of the box

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,960
if you're done with drupal 10 ready i

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:56,480
would love to talk about that too

00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,559
yes yeah we haven't thinking

00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,760
yeah people can hang on we can talk

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,319
about let me see if there's anything

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,280
else

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:07,440
there's nothing else that i'm supposed

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:08,880
to be at for a couple hours so um

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,359
if people want to leave that's fine too

00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,960
but um what's the question

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,040
so i'm working on the claro admin team

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,160
and it's now bundled into the easy out

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,400
of the box initiative

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,200
and i'm wondering like what you mean

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,799
isn't that

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,920
aren't you beautiful out of the box like

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,280
there was easy out of the box and

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,599
beautiful out of the box and

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,880
you're beautiful out of the box no i

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,480
don't i think there's this new front end

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,480
team and there's easy out of the box and

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,799
claro is part of the easy out of the box

00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,839
okay finished that's fine it went back i

00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,800
wasn't sure

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,720
yeah laurie's not even in the box

00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,440
[Laughter]

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,480
but claro is in the box in the box what

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,319
is the point

00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,400
um so yeah i guess

00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,160
i i would love it if we could find an

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,160
initiative lead for this initiative

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,359
this initiative lead um would

00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:02,160
have with their team an interesting

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,680
responsibility of going to the

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,440
contributors to three different

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,079
experimental

00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,480
um modules and themes from the at least

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,280
three

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,040
from the drupalite cycle going to all of

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,920
their roadmaps and all of their blockers

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,160
to standard and

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,040
gathering information and then you know

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,280
prioritizing

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,200
working from there so i think i think

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,119
it's a it's an exciting i like

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,559
i'm very excited about the idea of it

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,240
because it it

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,599
encourages us to think holistically and

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,640
prioritize

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:34,000
across multiple features um but it does

00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,319
you know it's gonna be

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,760
it's gonna be fun i i it's the things

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,799
that i actually care about the most

00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,720
unfortunately i'm already involved with

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,559
two other initiatives so i can't

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,240
put my hat in the ring for it just if

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,680
you had to describe like the ideal

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,520
um personality or skill set or whatever

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,119
for an initiative need for this what

00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,720
what would it be because like i think a

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,160
lot of people who don't have all the

00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,839
background may be like i don't know just

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,280
add it to standard profile you're done

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,040
you know what i mean and that's not what

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,079
this is so could you maybe talk a little

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,240
bit about

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,839
i think well i think uh people

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,599
contributors that we would need

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:10,240
um accessibility is a huge

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,880
um set of of blockers and considerations

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,799
for

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,720
all three of at least of the things that

00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,880
are already included so

00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,640
having someone as part of the initiative

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,839
team who really like

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,359
could focus on and triage accessibility

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,440
issues and work with the accessibility

00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,799
team would be very important i think

00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,720
um i think that uh

00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,160
it should probably be someone who's come

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,599
already comfortable like really

00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,160
comfortable with the issue queue while

00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,520
there's

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,280
you know there's other opportunities

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,480
where a project manager who's

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,160
you know not that familiar with the

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,520
issue queues could get ramped up this is

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,599
one where you're

00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,200
you'd have to be able to dig into like

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,559
history in the core queue and so it

00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,599
would be good to have

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,079
um from a like someone who's

00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,839
used to working in core and it has maybe

00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,440
even contributed on in one of these

00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,680
initiatives in the past because then if

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,799
you

00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,240
say okay i know i i worked a little on

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,200
layout builder i worked a little on

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,880
media

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,799
one of those things is like i can apply

00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,880
this then to sort of take these three

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:12,559
initiatives and make them one

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,760
um yeah people someone who cares about

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,640
and someone who cares about

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,240
like the initiative is about like the

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,680
experience of drupal right it's about

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,599
it's about ux

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,359
um and so i think it'll be exciting to

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:27,760
people who care about

00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:29,440
like the day-to-day use of dribble

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,200
how it looks how it feels if any of the

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,480
umami people are even interested in this

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,000
but the people who are involved in the

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,839
umami initiative i feel like take a

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,440
really

00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:39,040
great they really had that skill set in

00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,040
in spades was like take a really

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,480
holistic look at the beginner experience

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,400
and really making that

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,160
excellent um and i think we need that

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,760
same attention to detail

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,520
i mean we could we could like reach out

00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,880
to mommy contributors and say hey

00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,960
like we're doing this now are you

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,280
interested because umami is fantastic

00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,760
and we want to apply some of the same

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,760
genius to core except with no content

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,200
that is what is needed like you know

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,480
important i mean default content is

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,520
could be under the umbrella of this

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,760
initiative because that's something that

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,040
gets requested a lot too

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,400
but i think it's from a strategic

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,480
god what is that like what is the

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,720
is that you have to like scare your face

00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,760
these are my javascript glasses

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,720
um i i was going to say

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,520
the the you mentioned umami the there's

00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,799
actually a

00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:31,200
um a gatsby uh

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,319
demo code that uses an umami

00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,280
installation

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,839
uh that renders the content uh using

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,200
react

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,839
and and gatsby right um i just

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,240
thought of that um yeah that's all i

00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,240
wanted to say

00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,559
these are glasses my my son built

00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,920
actually

00:59:48,559 --> 01:00:00,400
just led like hot

00:59:51,920 --> 01:00:02,400
to a pair of goggles

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,440
i don't wanna fall and told anyone to do

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,440
anything but what i

01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,720
what i'm trying to emphasize is that

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,839
umami was

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,359
uh by all stretches of the imagination a

01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,920
hugely successful initiative

01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,520
it came out of nowhere like this was not

01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,200
this is a community initiative yeah this

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,480
isn't a community initiative a bunch of

01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,000
people got together and they were like

01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,680
we can make this better and we need

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,200
kind of that same almost like jeff eaton

01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,359
back in the snowman initiative

01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,960
you remember like that's very old school

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,640
but like you know i think we need

01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,319
someone thinking about this through that

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,319
lens of like how are we going to help

01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,599
beginners be successful with drupal

01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,960
and getting all these modules in there

01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,440
out of the box is definitely a part of

01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:43,839
it but

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:43,839
um yeah anyway that's just

01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,640
million requests for this document in

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,559
this chat um

01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,760
so i'm assuming yeah i host it somewhere

01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,200
and

01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,000
so um do you know if if the chat is

01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,799
um is the is the chat recorded

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,119
historically

01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,480
or should i what i've been told is that

01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,640
the chats are preserved

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,480
up until friday and then all bets are

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,119
off so what i have been doing is

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,559
like copying and pasting it into a

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,200
google doc which then

01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,319
is a perfect process but all right i'm

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,880
going to try doing that now

01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:23,520
yeah if you save the link to this

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,760
session now from your browser

01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,440
and you can access the same link until

01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,839
the end of the conference even though

01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,839
this

01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,680
particular content will not continue

01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,440
until the end of the conference

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,720
but the link will be live until the end

01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,360
of the conference

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:40,640
so if you save the url to the session

01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,400
[Music]

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,520
i just i have the chat i copied and

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,000
pasted it so i'll put it in the google

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,000
doc once i have access

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,359
yeah you need to you need to scroll up

01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,720
though because it's oh yeah i

01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,680
i scrolled way up to yeah oh no it

01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,440
didn't get

01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,559
it's i scrolled back to an hour ago and

01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,160
then it oh what a pain

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,480
i just scroll all the way up and then

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,599
copy and paste 20 or so at a time

01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,280
it's it's not oh you can copy the whole

01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,839
thing i've copied out the whole thing

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,720
previously you just have to wait for the

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,200
yeah

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,160
load everything and then manually select

01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,920
everything yeah

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,680
it works do i need to write another

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,319
chrome scraping extension for this

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,319
conference

01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:37,680
or whatever it is pop in

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,039
okay um so we are way well over time so

01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,480
thanks everyone for coming we covered a

01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:47,359
lot of content

01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,160
so this is usually what happens in what

01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,319
we call

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,160
uh hard problems conversations at

01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,760
drupalcon

01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,200
not a very good marketing term but

01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,079
that's what we use

01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,240
and um um so you got two core

01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,680
discussions is the official name

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,119
yeah now we call it better marketing yes

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,799
key core discussions

01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:12,240
so um um so yeah so

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,640
um for those who are wondering how core

01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,319
is done this is this is how you do it

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,920
with a bunch of discussions and getting

01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,520
on the same page and figuring out the

01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,680
process together

01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,359
so i hope you can join the specific

01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,319
contributor
