back and forth like that um so we will

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,359
see how we do all right so i'm going to

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,559
kick it off i have whoopsie

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,679
this here all right

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
ah so my name is angie byron um i'm

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
talking to you about bridging the gap

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,000
from drupal 7 to drupal 9.

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,640
um actually before i get too far into

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
this

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
can people see the slides let's double

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,199
check that

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
okay great awesome thank you very much

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,920
that would be very awkward if i were

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
presenting and you couldn't see anything

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,360
cool

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
so my name is angie webchick byron i

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
work at acquia i've been involved in the

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,440
dribble community since 2005 as a google

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
summer of code student because i

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,800
had major imposter syndrome and i

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
thought that you had to be a freaking

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
genius to contribute to open source and

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,600
that was for students and i was like all

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,440
right let me try this and then i

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
proceeded to get extremely involved in

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
all aspects of drupal

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
core development contrib development

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
webmaster stuff

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,879
security team stuff and you name it and

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,480
these days i'm a drupal core committer

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,359
and a product manager for drupal

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,840
so um today i'm going to talk to you

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
about migration so why are we here

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
we are here because these are numbers

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
taken from about last week

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,080
today most sites that are on drupal are

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
still on drupal 7. we don't know for

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
sure

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,799
these are based on the update status

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
module numbers that drupal.org has

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,240
um but that's a big chunk of the pie

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,759
still on drupal 7.

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
the next biggest chunk obviously drupal

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
8 because drupal 9 just came out

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
basically a month ago

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
so people are still kind of working off

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
that um and

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
drupal 7 is a great release i've worked

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,640
on drupal 7 big fan of drupal 7 however

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,240
if you're still on drupal 7 you're

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,479
missing out on all kinds of awesome

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,000
stuff that has happened since 2011 which

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
is quite a long time

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
we've added all kinds of new stuff for

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
content authors

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,000
richer media management layout builder

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,759
mobile friendly stuff out of the box

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
all of this stuff kind of integrated and

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
really you know working well together

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
then we have all this great stuff for

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
site builders you know configuration

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
management is a huge one

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
drupal 8 9 assumes out of the box that

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
you want configuration to be moved

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
between environments so everything is

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,360
set up that way

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,440
the multilingual support in eight and

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,640
nine is exquisite we have improved

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
accessibility

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,239
we have expanded support for structured

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
content all these things that make

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
drupal really flexible those are in

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
eight and nine as well

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,040
and then there's all this great stuff in

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
drupal 89 for developers as well

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
the whole api first initiative which

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
gave you know native support for json

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
api for people who want to write

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
decoupled front-ends

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
updating to the latest of the back-end

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
code you know modern

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,239
web standards php 7 all these kinds of

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,440
things

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,840
an improved theme system better caching

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
all manner of things to help developers

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
you know do better in drupal and then

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
you know as well as all the future

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
innovation that's happening in 91 and

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
contrib

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
so we have all these great things going

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
that's going on

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
but if you're still on drupal 7 you're

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,200
not benefiting from these things and

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
it can cause a lot of people to kind of

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,239
ask themselves why am i still even on

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
drupal

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,239
because the fact is migrations from

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,000
drupal 7 you know they can be expensive

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
there are several steps in the process

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
so in your analysis and planning phase

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,200
that's when you're looking at all the

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
modules that you have

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
you're trying to figure out what the

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
best modules to replace them in drupal 9

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,440
are and that's not always a

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,480
straightforward process

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
you also want to uh you know take a look

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
at your content model that you developed

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
10 years ago and see if you still like

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
it that way you might want to say

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,319
consolidate

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
uh content types down to you know like i

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,200
used to have seminars and events and you

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
know this other thing and i want to make

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,400
them all webinars or something like that

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,959
uh there's a devops piece drupal 9 has a

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
a much higher security i'm sorry not

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
securities uh system requirements

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
compared to drupal

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
7 because it's much newer um and they

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
want us to be

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
you know on supported software for a

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
long time there is the data import piece

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,720
which is actually getting the nuts and

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
bolts of your content into your new

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,439
drupal 9 site

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,280
there's the business logic piece and

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
presentation piece so any kind of custom

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
code you have on your site

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
that all needs to be moved to drupal 9

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
which is

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
oftentimes like a rewrite from the old

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
way to the new way and so all of these

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
steps together start implementing the

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,640
time and the cost

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,239
um and then that kind of intimidates

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
people and it and it makes them feel

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
a little bad uh i'm just going to switch

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
to chat real quick can anyone uh

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,560
empathize with these points that i'm

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
making does this ring true to you

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
yes a lot of people saying yes okay

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
great um

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
all right yeah we had acquia did a round

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
of user research with

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
our user research team and and came up

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
with all kinds of problems that people

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
were having with drupal 7 to drupal 9.

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,520
so i'm here to tell you um a little bit

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
about what the upgrade process looks

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,479
like and what tools and tricks are

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,880
available in the open source world and

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
then

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,160
something we've been working at aquia to

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
kind of help

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
mitigate some of the pain points as well

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,800
so so what does the upgrade process look

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
like overall

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
well first i highly recommend this it's

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
time for some spring cleaning or summer

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
cleaning

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,320
or winter cleaning or whatever you know

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
season it is in your area so like look

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
carefully

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
at all of the modules you're using all

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
the custom code that you have and really

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
ask yourself do you need it

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
does it spark joy if it doesn't as much

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,199
of that as you can get rid of before you

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
even start

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,400
the better off you're going to be

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
another really good tip is get on the

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
latest version of all of your drupal 7

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
projects so

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,720
if you're trying to migrate from you

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
know this this this module to that

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
module but you're using an older version

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
and the database is not quite up to par

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
the migration path is going to fail and

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
that's going to give you a lot of

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
problems

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
there's also a really great known

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,039
upgrade issues page

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,600
i can click it here i think

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,800
on drupal.org which is really good to

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
give a read through because this will

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
tell you a stuff that you're going to

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
hit

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,240
um little gotchas here and there like

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,320
for example views

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
are not migrated so any views that you

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
have you'll have to create manually

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
but you know hey there's a cut there's a

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
patch over here and there's a module

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
that might be able to help you with that

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
those kind of tips and tricks are

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,000
helpful there um

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
and then the migration process itself is

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
very different if anybody was around

00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,919
back in the days of like drupal 6 and

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,880
drupal 5

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,880
even those were a much different process

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,720
you would basically create

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,240
uh you know you're you'd basically

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
install drupal

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
you know n plus 1 on top of your

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
existing drupal site

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
and break everything and then you'd run

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,759
update.php and wait for

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,639
minutes to hours to days for that to

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,240
finish

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,520
doing what it's doing and then finally

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
at the end of it you'd have kind of an

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,039
upgrade in place

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,039
of your old data to your new data in

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,880
drupal 8 and 9 we don't do that anymore

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,919
because that way is fraught with a bunch

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
of peril

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,600
data integrity issues and other things

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,759
so instead you make a new

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
fresh drupal 9 site that you don't do

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,800
anything with

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
you don't want to add content here you

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
don't want to make big configuration

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
changes here because what you want to do

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
is make that

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
sort of your workspace for where all

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
your sites going to go

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
and then you migrate your drupal 7 site

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
to it and the nice thing about that is

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
it allows you to keep your drupal 9 and

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,840
your drupal 7 site up and running in

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
parallel

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
so that when you can when it comes time

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
to do the big cut over

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,240
you're not waiting and waiting for some

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
massive upgrade process to happen you

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
can instead just

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
flip the switch um so i'll pause there

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
any questions on the

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,599
the overall process um of how you

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
upgrade from drupal 7.9

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
yeah someone's pointing out that there

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
there are some modules that aren't

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
available in drupal 9 and then you have

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
a whole bunch of fun

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
trying to figure out what you're

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
possibly going oh yeah his angioception

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
sorry

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,800
i don't know how to how to fix that um

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
yeah a question is is it worth pausing

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
at drupal 8. it's a fair question

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
the nice thing about drupal's migration

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
system is it's flexible it'll let you do

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
either one

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
so if you find and we'll get into some

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,919
tools to do this later

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,520
if you find that there are more of your

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
modules available in drupal 8 than there

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
were in drupal 9

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
you may want to go to eight first as an

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
interim because the upgrade path from

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,520
eight to nine

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,800
unlike any other upgrade path since like

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,360
i don't know drupal 4

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,479
1 or something is super straightforward

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
it's basically

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
you know update to the latest version of

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
your code make sure you're not using any

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
deprecated functions

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,720
ta-da bang you're done um so a lot of

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
people do

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
do that some people figure if they're

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
going to do a big upgrade they want to

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
do it once and they want to be on the

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,280
latest version

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
either way works um but a lot of people

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
do

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
move to uh to eight um just you know as

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
an

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,000
as an interim step um and then content

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,919
freezes yeah

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,319
um there are tools within the migration

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,160
system to sync over your latest content

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
as it's going so you don't have to do a

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,120
content freeze for the entire time that

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
you're doing the migration

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,399
that's another big advantage of this

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
approach even though it's it's a little

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,200
bit more work because you're building

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,800
your new site up from scratch

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
it allows you to do it in the way that

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,519
that makes the most sense and it also

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
allows you to

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
um you know to make it so that you can

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,760
still keep using the site as it is in

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
place and only really get into freezes

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
when you get to that point where you're

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
really ready you're close to ready to

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
launch

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
um so yeah those are really great

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
questions

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
uh so i want to talk about some of the

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
open source tools that are out there to

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
help

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,399
um so first off drupal 8 and 9 ship with

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,800
a powerful

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,040
and now stable migrate api so the my

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,120
grade api has been part of drupal core

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,560
since drupal 8.0 like way back in 2015

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
but it initially shipped as an

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
experimental module or a set of

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
experimental modules

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,279
and it's been a lot of work by a lot of

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
awesome people over the past

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
four and a half years to get that to

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,279
stable including multilingual

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
migrations which previously were not so

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,640
huge shout out to those folks

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
so that means that all of the core

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,279
modules ship with migration

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
stuff out of the box both from drupal 6

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,600
and 7 to drupal 8 and 9.

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,120
so that's a really really powerful thing

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
there's also a very basic

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
ui in there that attempts to replicate

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,000
what update.php used to do

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
uh so that's also a helpful thing if

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
that's

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
you know if you have like your personal

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
blog or something like that and it's a

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
one and done kind of go it's it's really

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,959
useful for that

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
um how the migrate api works as a as a

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
concept

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,560
is uh it's it's basically you know an

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
entity transform

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079
type of thing you start with a source

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
and the default source that ships with

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
drupal is

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,160
drupal 6 and 7. so i have a classic

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,600
druplicon there

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,079
but in contrib there's all sorts of

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,959
other sources you can import from csv

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,600
from a sql that table from wordpress

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,839
json

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
xml pretty much you name it just like

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
everything else in drupal these are very

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
pluggable

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,440
so you can actually pull the source from

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
wherever you want but drupal core by

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
default covers six and seven

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
and then you're migrating that to a

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
destination which is either drupal 8 or

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,079
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,760
or you know again plugable you can make

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
it be something else if you want it to

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
be

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
and then in between there is a process

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
uh plugins

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,160
process plugins do transforming ah see

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,480
autobots but transforming for good

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
not for bad so autobots not decepticons

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
but anyway

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
um and these will do things like massage

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
the data on it when it's on its way over

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
so for example

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,360
uh if you had a series of comma

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
separated values and you want those to

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,640
be a full you know

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,800
array of values you can run explode on

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
them it can it knows how to validate

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
that something is a valid

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
machine name uh various other process

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
plugins when i share the deck around

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,880
each of these

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,560
links links off to a page in the

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
drupal.org handbook that describes each

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,480
of these in detail

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,440
but basically this is the process move

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,360
from a source

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
to a destination processing along the

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
way and each one of these things is

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,560
pluggable and very flexible

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
so that you can either you know contrib

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
modules can add their own stuff to this

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,880
or you can do your own custom stuff as

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,720
well

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
and these files are all written in yaml

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,079
files to kind of set up the framework

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,279
and then php to do the actual work

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
when you want when it comes time to

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
execute migrations you have essentially

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
two options there

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
one is that drupal migrate ui as i

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,320
mentioned so this is a

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
uses a module-based system so it kind of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,640
looks at all the year modules in your

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
system

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,320
it explains which ones will not be

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,959
upgraded because they don't have

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
a a corresponding destination which ones

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
will

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
um and then you also have the option and

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
this is what most people do choose

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,519
of using command line excuse me command

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
line tools for this was just drush

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,120
and uh there's three modules kind of

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
involved in that migrate tools get you

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
the actual drush commands

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,839
migrate upgrade will generate the

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
migrations for you

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
for moving from six to eight or six to

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,680
nine and then migrate plus is kind of

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
this awesome grab bag of

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360
additional functionality which includes

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,760
you know extra sources

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
extra you know destinations it's got uh

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,040
examples

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
code in there it's got extra you know

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
drush awesomeness

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,360
so the three of those together are make

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,760
really make for a powerful

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
uh tool and uh and the the dress

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,279
commands are also more flexible than the

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
ui is currently so for example you can

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
roll back

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,519
not just import your your migrations um

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
and you can you can you can kind of

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,839
import incrementally instead of doing

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
the whole thing in one go

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,880
um you also need to make sure there's a

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,399
destination to migrate to

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
or else it's going to you know you're

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,200
going to leave data behind in your old

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,880
drupal 7 state

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
so there's a module in contrib called

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,600
upgrade status not to be confused with

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
update status which ships in core

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
and that is something you install on

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
your drupal 7 site and what it will do

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
is it will

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
basically scan all of your existing

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,720
modules and then see if it can

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
find a corresponding drupal 8 version of

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,760
that module and if there's an existing

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,920
drupal 8 version there's often existing

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
drupal 9 version as well

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,200
this is also the same tool that you use

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,480
to move from 8 to 9

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
it's just a little bit different the

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,320
drupal 7 version because it's

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
it's much more oriented around does this

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
project exist or not rather than

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
oriented around

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
is this using deprecated code or not um

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
and then

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
for your custom modules uh there's a

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,519
tool called the drupal 7 to 8

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,079
droop module upgrader um and this is

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
a a series of drush commands and it's

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,839
kind of cool it basically

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,480
scans through your code where it finds

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,240
old stuff it links you to change record

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
on drupal.org so you can read more about

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
why you know for example you don't use

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
hook block info anymore and now we use

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
something else

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
and then in a lot of cases it has the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,760
opportunity to automatically do a basic

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
level conversion

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,399
of that code for you and so this will

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,160
not be like a quick run a script and oh

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,880
you're on drupal 9 but it does get you

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
quite uh

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
far into the process uh so that you

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
don't have to start completely from

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
scratch

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
trying to understand how to port one

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,480
module to the other when we're building

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,040
this thing we use the diff module as our

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,920
kind of

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,920
test space and diff is nice excuse me

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
diff is nice because it has you know

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,680
forms that it has it has admin pages

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
um you know it accomplishes you know

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
different goals it has menus it exposes

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,519
so

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,440
i think it might even have blocks and

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,560
stuff like that so anyway it it does a

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
whole bunch of

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
kind of the basic things to get you

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
started um

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,600
and then another thing that people like

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,720
to do when they're on their way into

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,079
drupal 9 is

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
you know i've got this content maybe

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,000
this content is from even before

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
drupal 7 maybe i've been you know moving

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
along since 1995 or something

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,600
uh so let's make sure our content is

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
cleaned up and there's a really great

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
tool out there

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
that i don't think a lot of people know

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
about called migrate qa and migrate qa

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
is by phase two

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
and it's a uh it's essentially you know

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
how everybody has like those

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,680
spreadsheets

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
massive spreadsheets that you spread

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
around and it has like all the columns

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
and whether or not you've checked

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,279
whether or not this content is up to

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,079
date or it's missing a screenshot or

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,279
whatever

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,800
it's basically that uh but dynamic and

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
built into drupal itself

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,959
so that you can flag content as you know

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,120
needing approval or you can

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,279
you know add different customizable

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,800
flags to things you can create reports

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,519
of different types of content and this

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
kind of thing and

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,920
uh um it's it's really sweet there was a

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,600
uh there was a presentation on it at uh

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,440
drubacon seattle last year i encourage

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,680
you to check out

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,800
um so before i get into all that stuff

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
let's talk about

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
uh what let's see what's happening in

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,240
chat

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
so

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,160
are there other tools that people have

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,519
encountered in their migrations that

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,839
they want others to know about

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,279
uh yes i will provide the slides after

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,880
i'm not sure what the process is for

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
that i'll either tweet them out at

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
webchick or put them on the drupalcon

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,759
website whatever the sanctioned way to

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,759
do it is

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
ah feeds yeah feeds is a great little

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,600
module um

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,880
i know there's a feeds migrate i don't

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,079
know what the

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
status of that is right now

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,279
sorry i don't usually use chrome so all

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
my stuff is not auto filling like i

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,600
expect it to be

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,000
feeds is sort of a ui for bringing over

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,360
things from a source to a destination

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,959
and then there's a feeds migrate module

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
that last i looked at it

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,399
didn't quite have a ui yeah still in

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
development

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
um but definitely a really cool project

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
to keep an eye on

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
um because when we talked about how the

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
migrate system is structured in that

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
source

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,720
destination process way this provides a

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,519
ui for doing some of that kind of stuff

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
so good point

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
um if migrate can import from csv why

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
would you need the feeds migrate that's

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,480
a good question um

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,480
because feeds migrate is attempting to

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
give the site builder control over the

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,600
migration versus the drupal migration

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
system

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,720
right now anyway you you currently have

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
to be kind of a developer

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
to do that you have to run drush

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,880
commands you have to um create yaml

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,600
files php files that kind of thing and

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
so

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,360
um yeah this is particularly challenging

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
for people who

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,080
you know might have learned php via

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,400
drupal in older versions of drupal uh

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,400
coming up to speed on drupal 8's you

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,559
know object-oriented paradigms and stuff

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,120
like that is sometimes challenging and

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,280
um you know kind of looking at the vast

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
scope of what the migrate system can do

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
it's

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,640
very very powerful but it can also be

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,679
intimidating for people

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
at least out of the gate

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,799
do you think migration attempt is worth

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,720
for very complicated d7 projects with 30

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,000
plus custom modules and 150 contrib

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
modules

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
yeah i mean depending on what those are

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
i i feel

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,559
you know let's have some real talk for a

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
second here

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,559
if you're currently on drupal 7 one way

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
or the other you're going to have to

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,760
move off of drupal 7.

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,640
right now you don't have to do that

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,039
until november of 2022

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
that used to be november 2021 but it got

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
extended because of kovid and we were

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
like

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,120
crap people are really struggling and

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,240
let's be kind and give them an extra

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,760
year on their end of life

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,080
and so that was done a few weeks ago um

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,520
but and then and if that's not even late

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,799
enough for you there's extended vendor

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,919
support that takes it all the way to

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,360
2025.

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
so you've got a long runway on your

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,799
drupal 7 site but at some point

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
you're going to have to move off it

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,200
because it will no longer be security

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,039
supported

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
um or because you don't want to you know

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,640
pay a vendor to security support

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
for you and at that point you have a

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
couple of options you can either

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,799
uh you know move to something like

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240
wordpress or adobe experience manager

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,160
whatever fits the bill and kind of do a

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,520
whole re-platforming situation

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,840
or you can stay on drupal and go through

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,760
that

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,360
sort of you know big migration from

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
drupal 7 to drupal 8 or nine

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
one time and then from then beyond the

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,280
little mini

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
you know updates that take half a day or

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,360
something to actually accomplish

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
um either way you have to incur the cost

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,480
of analyzing all of your data

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,600
figure out what functionality you have

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
and how to replicate it in the new

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
system

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
but if you stay with drupal then all of

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
the knowledge that you have

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
about drupal architecture the site

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,559
building concepts views

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,840
structured content um web forms you name

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
it all the contrib stuff that you're

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
used to

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,000
you get to keep using that knowledge and

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
it doesn't all go away and you don't

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
have to rewrite all of the things that

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
you've learned retrain all of your

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
people on it

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,799
so for me and i'm obviously biased

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
but for me it seems like the best idea

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,120
is to stay with drupal if you can

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
because

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
once you've incurred the cost of

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
re-platforming whether it's to wordpress

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,160
or whether it's the drupal 9

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,320
um drupal 9 keeps you on that easy

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,799
upgrade path then for the rest of time

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
versus if you're moving to adobe say

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
every time they come up with a new

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
vision

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,400
major version you have to do a

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,919
re-platform again um and so

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,200
you know it's about where you want to

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
sync your costs i think

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,880
all right i'm going to get into

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
this is the sponsored part of the thing

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,320
but it is relevant because you know i

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
see some people in there

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,360
that are saying a lot of things that our

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,720
customers are saying as well which is

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
you know this is cool but man this

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
sounds like a lot of work

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,840
and i have to become a developer and i

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
have to know all those things about my

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,280
underlying data schemas

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,799
and i have to write process plugins and

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,240
like i'm very intimidated by this

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,600
process is there anything

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,360
that's going to make this easier so yes

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,640
aqui has been kind of focused on this

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,880
problem for the past

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
well probably about nine months or so

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
maybe a year

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
um and what we're aiming to do is create

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
a product which is coming out later in

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,280
2020 it's currently in a private beta

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,960
um that's going to migrate drupal 7 to 9

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
applications up to 50

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,480
faster we're saying and i want to point

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,200
out technically zero

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
is up to 50 faster i'm just kidding um

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
but anyway

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,400
the benefits of this is we we saw that

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,320
that people were getting intimidated by

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
the developer knowledge required to use

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
drupal's migrate api to the point

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,919
that they would even like write their

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,080
own you know custom sql scripts or

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
whatever in order to avoid learning it

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,280
um so we're trying really hard to center

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
the site builder

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,360
in this product um so we're creating a

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,080
ui that essentially does everything that

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,799
you know drush can do but also has a lot

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
of built-in

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
smarts for things like dependency

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
management knowing the best way of doing

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
something and codifying that in an

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,840
opinionated way

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,679
um to and the idea being there to lower

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
the barrier of entry for doing content

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
migration so you don't need to come up

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
this big learning cliff

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,159
we give you an ocular provided migration

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
workspace and then we build in a bunch

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
of best practices

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,159
in the product itself and i want to be

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,400
clear about what this does it does not

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,240
uh one click button move you to drupal 9

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
and birds are chirping and unicorns are

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,200
farting rainbows and everything but

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,960
what it is going to do is cut the cost

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,679
of all of these different areas

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
uh significantly so that hopefully when

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,480
it comes time to move from drupal 7 and

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,720
9 you are not

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
you know in a in a lot in a you know

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
just staring down something that looks

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,320
very intimidating is hard to do

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,600
but i want to emphasize it's only going

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
to help with part of the overall

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,240
migration

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,760
you will still need a developer for for

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,200
any tricky custom code

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
as well as your presentation code

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,520
although we do integrate with aqueous

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,679
site studio which is kind of a low code

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
design focus situation if you want a

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
kind of a point-and-click way to get

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
your theme back

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
so there's four components an additional

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
awkward cloud environment module

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,760
recommendation engine

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,400
enhanced migration capabilities and a ui

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
it's a react

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
ui so it's all swooshy bushy and then uh

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
optional if you want it you can

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
integrate with site studio to

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,200
you know uh kind of speed up the the

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
theme process

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
so you'll have a new environment in your

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,440
aqua cloud environment

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,159
or cloud application it's a special

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
environment

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,480
that won't let you drag and drop code to

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,559
it the only thing it's for is for

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,320
migrating it has a couple of features

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,360
for example a refresh button that you

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
can use

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,559
to automatically pull all of the uh like

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
a fresh

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,919
copy of your database from your

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,720
production environment um

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,320
and then when you click on it um it's

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,919
creating a drupal 9

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
website for you that's automatically

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,039
composerified

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,480
and also goes against a module

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,480
recommendations engine

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,799
and this is where our team the drupal

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,799
acceleration team has kind of run down

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,640
you know the rabbit hole with um as many

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,720
contrib modules as we can

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,960
to figure out hey if you're using

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,559
paragraphs you need to move to this

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
here's some patches that are required to

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
make it work and then we mark

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
a migration path we've had the

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,080
opportunity to kind of you know do that

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,919
with as vetted is true so that you know

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
that you're getting the most up-to-date

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,600
uh you know and complete migration

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,760
possible

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,120
um i can attempt to do a live demo here

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
these are always fun

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,279
um any questions so far on what we're

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,600
trying to do here what it is and what it

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
isn't

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,400
looks like we have technical problems

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
with hoppin at the moment

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,240
is there something that can help with

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,480
transitioning php templates to twig

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,640
there is something called

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,799
twiggify i want to say was the name of

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,799
it

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,840
yep um it was not touched recently ago

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,000
so i don't know that i would trust that

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
um but theoretically anyway yeah i mean

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,120
this is just

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
code like any other code and the ability

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,039
to you know scan it and

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
modify it in place should be possible

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,720
drupal module

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,799
upgrader doesn't deal with that uh

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,600
drupal module upgrader we really

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
uh focused on on on the module piece of

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,240
that

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,360
um only because the the library we're

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,279
using is a

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,279
is a php parsing library it's actually

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,039
cool it kind of parses it like uh like

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,760
jquery more or less and you can

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,600
you know say this function arrow this

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,360
property blah blah

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,840
but we couldn't find a similar library

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,720
like that for for html parsing

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,679
um probably because parsing html is a

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
nightmare and

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,799
nobody would want to write a library to

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,799
do it because it's

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,799
horrible and sad um

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,720
uh is it going to be open oh the thing

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,080
i'm talking about is gonna be open

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
source or specific to the hogware

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,760
hosting platform

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,720
at the moment specific to acquia hosting

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
um

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
because we got to walk before we can run

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
and we want to make sure that it's

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,200
working really well and that's the

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,440
environment that we control

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
however all of the changes that we have

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,039
to make to the migration system and to

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
these contrib modules into core and

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,840
everything else to make the product work

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
well

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,880
that's all making their way up into

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,480
upstream patches so

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,320
through the making of this product we're

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
also in turn

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,760
making migrations better for everyone

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
and i pulled stats and it's something

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
like 200 or something migration issues

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,480
our team has managed to work on over the

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,720
past three quarters

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,559
i think we've managed to help fix about

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
50 bugs or something like that

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,000
and so um we're trying to make this so

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,440
it's a beneficial thing for awkward

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
customers but also a beneficial thing

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,679
for the community

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,799
all right let's see if i can not screw

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,840
up a live demo

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,159
this should be fun uh all right so

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,919
i have this website called aqua training

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,760
uh because it turns out at acquia we

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,240
have drupal 7 sites too that we haven't

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,440
moved

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,360
yet so um so this site has

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,640
uh you know a few different things in it

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,279
it has um

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,400
let me go to my content types it has a

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,679
company profiles

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,440
courses events page and so on uh it has

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,679
a few different views you know you've

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
got a list of study guides

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,760
you've got a list of uh free trainings

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,159
you know all this kind of stuff so it's

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,520
a

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
it's a pretty basic site it's like a

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,000
brochure website but there are some them

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,240
some tricky bits

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
in there like for example if you look at

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
uh you know training courses and some of

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,559
these events

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,039
you know there's quite a few fields here

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,080
like date cost delivery event details

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
and so on

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
um so we thought it would be a good

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,240
thing to throw this tool out and see

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,000
if it could do anything or not so so i'm

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,520
going to pop into the tool this is the

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
welcome page that you get when it's

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,640
first

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,159
installed um and it gives you like

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,360
here's the things that you need to do

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,960
so um what we work off of is a copy

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,960
of your drupal 7 database and files

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
so that we can reference them throughout

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
the migration process and i'll talk

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,120
about that in a minute but for now i'm

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,120
just going to log in

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,399
with my extremely secure password

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,799
um no i do not uh and then the first

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,799
step

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,880
of the process is to choose which data

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,399
to import

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,159
so once again this is reading from the

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,760
drupal 7 copy of your database

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,679
and we put all this stuff in site

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
builder terminology so you can see it's

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,640
called things like aqueous

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,200
certifications taxonomy terms

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,320
user accounts it's not called like d7

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,679
underscore user da blah blah blah

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
we thought that was really important for

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,679
people to feel familiarity with

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,039
their new drupal 9 site and it looks a

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,320
lot like their old triple seven site

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,000
that was the goal

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,679
um it automatically knows to skip

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
anything with zero pieces of content so

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,799
you can see that this

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,000
this um this site was not using private

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,960
file so it's just gonna skip it

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,559
automatically

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,559
i could also choose to skip anything

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,840
else but one thing i can't skip is

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,159
anything like filter format

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,120
configuration that other migrations

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,880
rely on so there's deep knowledge of

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,640
what migration dependencies exist so

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
that you can't for example

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,399
import article comments without first

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,320
importing articles without first

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,399
importing tags and so on

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
so i'm going to start this just leave

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,360
the defaults here

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,360
and this will take me to the migrations

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,039
dashboard so

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,880
initially this doesn't import and what

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,640
this is doing is it's automatically

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,640
creating in drupal 9

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,559
the various containers for moving my

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
content over so it's creating content

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,799
types vocabularies

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,520
filter formats all this kind of stuff so

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,360
that

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,960
when we start looking at some of the

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,960
actual content in the system you know

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
like web forms or events or this kind of

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
thing

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
we can be sure that there's something to

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,960
actually move those things into

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,880
there's an overall progress meter here

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,120
to keep you posted on how you're doing

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
there's also a tracker number of errors

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,399
and then as things get moved over

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,799
they automatically get stuck into these

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,399
workflow uh situations like needs review

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
means it imported but there were some

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,799
problems

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
and completed means it imported and

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,200
there were no problems so good for you

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,640
um if i wanted to import these aqueous

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
certifications taxonomy turns you can

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,120
see that i can't

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
this is grayed out and that's because i

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,480
have unmet dependencies

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,320
which is that this needs public files in

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
order to continue so let's

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,520
import public files so i'm going to

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,600
click that

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
um so that instantly cues it up you can

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,039
see our our progress meter which i like

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
to call the swooshy bushy

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,399
starts moving and you can see the

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,640
progress counts up

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,320
once it's completed it moves out either

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,600
to needs review if there were problems

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,799
which there were in this case or

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,760
completed

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,679
depending on the situation so i'm going

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
to click on needs review

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,039
and let's take a look at these messages

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,679
that are coming up so

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,200
let's take a look here um so this is the

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,720
messages console this is to help you

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,679
debug any problems that are happening

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
your migrations

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
and i know none of your migrations are

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
going to have problems but just as a

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,799
general rule

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,559
when people migrate there are problems

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,640
so what this is telling you is this is

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,799
the message that came back from drupal

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,159
a lot of these are very funny funny

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,960
little messages that are

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,399
really fun to parse out and read but the

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
nice thing is that these are surfaced in

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,679
a ui for you because currently you have

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,240
to basically read an sql

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,600
table in order to get access to these um

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,080
and then we provide

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,679
where possible a user-friendly solution

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
uh column to these so what this is

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,559
telling

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,320
you is that uh this file is owned by a

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,080
user that no longer exists

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
um this is wrong in your drupal 7 site

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
too so please fix it there

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,600
and then refresh the source database and

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
roll back and import this migration

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,039
um and this is really nice because it's

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,159
tracking entity validation errors and

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,520
what that means is

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,600
these are data integrity problems you

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
have on your existing drupal 7 site

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
that when you bring them over into

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,159
drupal 9 are going to cause you problems

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,799
so this will surface those for you so

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
you can see

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,200
aha let me fix that in my drupal 7 set

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,720
and then once i've done that

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
i can come back to needs review and i

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,120
can say okay let's take public files

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,919
roll back and import and try it again

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,919
and see what happens

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,919
the other thing i want to point out that

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,519
we've done here again really focusing on

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,200
that site builder persona is

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,120
the concept of preview so you can see

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,919
now i don't have any unmet dependencies

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,519
for my

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,080
taxonomy terms so i can click in here

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,279
and i can see and and mind you nothing

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,440
has been imported yet

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,480
so i have imported zero of my taxonomy

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
terms but it will

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
give you kind of a mocked up preview of

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,159
what this is going to look like so

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
you can see that the source values

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,600
originally were this

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,000
the destination values are going to be

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,919
this and then we even offer a content

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,919
preview and i can just you know page

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
through a couple of these so you can see

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,640
um and it will show you a rendered

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,240
preview of what that's going to look

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,480
like and that's really helpful for

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
for example image paths you know it

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
might say you know

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,600
file blah blah blah and that sounds good

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,399
but uh but might be a broken image in

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,559
the end

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,399
um it also helps with like dates if

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,039
something's suddenly showing up as

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,080
you know january 1st of 1970 you know

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,600
there was some kind of a problem with

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,039
the mapping

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,880
and my favorite thing is that you can

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,880
actually browse uh

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,559
by the original url on the source site

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,000
so let me go to taxonomy here for a

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,840
second

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,640
and uh was it aqueous certifications i

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,840
think it was

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,919
well let's just pick i don't know uh

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,320
site factory pro why not

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,320
um if i copy and paste this whoops i'm

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,600
sorry uh this url from my

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,600
drupal 7 site um

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,880
into here it'll automatically pull that

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,320
up so i can preview that so that's

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,519
really helpful if you have

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,600
for example 700 billion articles but you

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,279
really care about the ceo's

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,960
fancy welcome message one and making

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,919
sure that the formatting came over okay

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,120
in that

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,720
um so you know pretty cool so i'm like

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,559
okay that looks great let's just import

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,600
a bunch of these and just let it fly and

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
see what happens

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,279
and so you can see that it uh you know

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,840
counts them up as it's completing takes

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,440
them out

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,279
if it highlights in green it's moving to

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
completed if it highlights in yellow

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,200
it's moving to knees review

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,919
and kind of going forth like that um

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,519
this if i

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,880
if i let it import everything because

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,640
there's thousands of records here

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,519
there's like something like 27 000

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,679
records

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
um it'll take about 15 minutes which i

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,159
don't want to take up that amount of

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,559
time because i want to leave time for q

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
a

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,840
so here's a finished one uh that i did

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,080
run through all of them on and you can

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,440
see as we start clicking around here

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,440
um i have content

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,279
and here's all my stuff from my drupal 7

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,559
site

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,440
here's an event for example um that you

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
can check out

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
you can see that the the front end of my

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,200
site has you know my study guide

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,640
link that's linking to my list of study

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
guides and so on

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,799
um so yeah pretty cool you can get

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
pretty far in a short amount of time

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,240
we're really focusing

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,120
again on that site builder use case and

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
trying to give people

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,080
early wins possible um because you know

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,000
it it can be scary and we want people to

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,119
feel successful and we want people to to

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,119
end up on drupal 9 and love it so that's

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,200
my spiel

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,200
uh questions on that

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,679
the wayne's world reference i'm so glad

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,000
someone in this audience is old enough

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,760
to know

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,040
what that is so that makes me very happy

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,720
all right um so that's a live demo uh if

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,040
you want to learn more there's this page

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,560
on aqua.com i can paste the link in chat

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,879
as well

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,000
if you're curious uh there's a forum

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,919
there

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,280
that they'll use again and uh when can

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,040
you try it i don't i'm

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,320
i'm not i'm trying to be very careful to

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,159
not give exact dates

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,599
uh if you're an aqua customer you can

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,839
talk to your am or your t

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,280
or your tam account manager technical

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,639
account manager

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,240
and they can talk to me and we can get

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,359
you hooked up if you meet the criteria

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,760
for beta

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,480
if you don't then i'm hoping that we can

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
release this very early on in q4

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
that's the idea because we want to get

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,359
people up to speed on getting these

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,359
migrations going

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,480
um but if you participate in the beta

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,160
the nice thing there is we're going to

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,560
work on your module problems first

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,000
and uh you get some say in how we

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,880
prioritize features that this thing

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,400
doesn't do

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,680
because uh people in the audience will

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,200
be quick to note that okay well this

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,800
does the content migration but there's

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,280
all kinds of other things that come

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,560
you know come into a migration and you

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,359
know for example

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,320
one uh hot uh feature request is the

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,680
ability to

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,000
um to fuss with the data model

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,200
as it's coming in so for example i don't

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,440
want you know to have field taxonomy one

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,320
move to drupal 9 i want to call it you

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
know

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
board game category or something like

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
that uh

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
so we're working on you know in the

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,320
future roadmap features like that that

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
allow you to mend your data so that

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,800
you're not stuck with decisions that you

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,880
made back in the in the drupal 7 days

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
and then yeah once again what you get

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
out of this if you're not an aqua

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,240
customer

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
upstream contributions galore because

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,839
anytime we find a bug in a module

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,320
or a core migration path or something

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,920
we are filing a patch for it and uh

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
we're adding the patch to our composer

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
json but you can just as easily add

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,000
patches to your composer json as well so

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,760
once again

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,359
the whole goal of this thing everybody

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
wins

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
okay blah blah blah enough with the

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
sales pitch already bringing it back

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,280
home

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,560
yes ma'am which is past me scolding

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,200
myself anyway

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,960
uh the summary drupal 9 lots and lots

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
and lots of new features lots of future

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,640
innovation it's so exciting to finally

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,280
have a version of drupal

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,880
that the core developers and the users

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,720
are on at the same time

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
i can't tell you how awesome that is

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,119
because that is not how it usually goes

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,079
um among these features is a really

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,480
powerful migration

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,760
system it's extremely flexible you can

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,680
move from anything

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
to drupal you can move from anything to

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,040
something else you can transform it in

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,079
all kinds of

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,839
fun and unholy ways there are tons of

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,839
things you can do right now to make your

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,240
drupal 7 site easier to migrate you can

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,839
do

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,520
some house cleaning you can do some

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,760
content content auditing

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,880
you can install that upgrade status

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,480
module to get a

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,599
picture of what your migration pack is

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,560
going to look like in terms of your

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,560
modules

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
i want to be clear if you want you can

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,599
go from seven and nine

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,520
directly you don't have to go to eight

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,200
first you can if you want there are more

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,960
modules available on drupal 8

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,640
right now anyway so you might have an

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
easier time but i just want to point

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,359
that out that depending on where you are

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,440
in your planning process

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,280
that's an option for you there are tons

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,800
and tons and tons of modules tutorials

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,400
etc that are available to help

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
and if you need extra help there's a

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
product for that so either way no matter

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
which way you go i really hope to see

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,119
you on drupal 9

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,720
soon and now we'll go one more time to

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,720
the chat see if we have some questions

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,440
uh do we have to be an awkward customer

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,640
to use acronym angry currently

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,760
yes once we get the product launched and

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,320
we get you know

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,960
all kinds of i don't know marketing and

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,839
sales

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,280
blue blue blue from it um that is one

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,480
thing i'm hoping we can do is just open

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,040
source the entire thing

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
um currently the what is open source

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,760
there any upstream contributions any

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,599
bugs patches we

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,000
need a file to fix problems in core and

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,560
contrib as well as the back end module

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,800
itself that is also going to be gpl v2

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,240
but the react ui that i was showing you

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,760
as well as the module recommendation

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,400
engine those are going to be proprietary

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,400
at least for now

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,240
cool how long does a migration take

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,320
that is such a fun question and the

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,359
answer is it depends

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,359
um so when we are trying to figure out

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,400
how long a migration takes one important

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,119
factor

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
that we uh lump into that is how much of

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,480
your

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
you know overall code base is covered in

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,240
drupal 9.

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,920
so a big thing that goes into factoring

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,359
that calculation is how many contrib

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,800
modules do you have versus how many

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,960
custom modules you have

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
one thing that people new to drupal can

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,079
get themselves in a lot of trouble with

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,760
especially if they're like php

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,920
developers uh

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,760
is they they think drupal's a framework

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
and they see it as apis and like oh

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,160
wonderful i can just start writing code

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,920
and making use of these wonderful apis

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
and then they get into trouble because

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,480
if they had used for example

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,839
panels or whatever contrib solution was

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,440
available at the time

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,040
they could have just checked a checkbox

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,520
to get that functionality instead of

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,920
writing 25 000 lines of code and now

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,520
that 25 000 lines of code needs to be

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,160
converted from the old procedural

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,040
functions

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,480
to the new object-oriented way um so

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,280
that would be my first question is how

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
many contrib

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,400
versus custom modules do you have

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
hopefully the ratios like

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,079
lots of contrib a little bit of custom

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,280
almost always your theme is going to be

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,599
custom and that's

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,119
that's understandable um the second

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,040
thing that i'd look at is like how

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,680
complex of a data model are you using

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,280
so for example are you um you know do

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,960
you do you have like tons and tons and

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,359
tons of content types are they using all

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,480
kinds of esoteric fields like a geo

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,960
field with a postgresql

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,160
you know geo location blah blah those

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,079
things are going to be harder to move

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,920
over than things that like say the top

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,359
200 modules that the community is using

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
because most of those

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,480
are getting a lot of really good

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,440
attention so i want to actually

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,800
pull up this page i'm gonna have to do

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,480
this from memory because again

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:20,319
chrome not my usual browser um

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,359
but where is it yeah this

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,640
um so this is a dashboard i can paste a

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,640
link to that in chat as well

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,640
this is a dashboard showing all of the

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,160
modules uh porting process to drupal 9.

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,160
so as you can see

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,079
um you know that's the only part that's

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,680
explicitly drupal 9 compatible which is

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,720
a third of the modules which is pretty

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,640
impressive actually

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,920
anybody who's around when drupal 8 first

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,599
came out knows

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,119
that the initial modules that were ready

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,040
for drupal 8 were like

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,800
maybe that at best i don't even think it

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,880
was that much it was it was not much

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,560
so this is pretty much 30 of the modules

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,440
an additional 30 percent need

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,400
one line change to one file and then

00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,599
they're ready to go

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
and there are patches already in the

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,560
queue ready for them to go so

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,200
um so you know check your contributed

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,200
modules

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,880
against this list you can search you

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,119
know if you have like the

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,599
i don't know the bibliography module see

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,760
if i can spell bibliography on a

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,880
tuesday afternoon nope apparently i

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,200
can't um

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,079
but anyway if you if you have a drupal 8

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,359
let's do

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:27,040
not views that's in core now web form

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,359
sure not web from that's a different

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,000
thing

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
okay um wow okay well the search is not

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,359
working right now that's cool

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,240
i love finding i love that the live demo

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,760
of my thing

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,359
that could have broken in a million ways

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,400
went okay but then this is not working

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,359
but anyway

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
um so web form i can just show you is

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,599
like

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,880
i don't know somewhere on this list here

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,880
we go so you can say yep

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,319
it's exclusive it's explicitly drupal 9

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,319
compatible um

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,160
there's any notes left by the maintainer

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,760
about what's required to do that

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,680
so going through and auditing your

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,800
modules that way is a good first step to

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,640
see how it goes

00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
and then um and then it also depends on

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,560
like you know how much cleanup you want

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,160
to do

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,680
if you're doing a just kind of a lift

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,760
and shift just like ah get it in a

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,520
drupal 9 and we'll sort it out later

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,440
or if you're trying to couple this with

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,400
like say a big redesign which a lot of

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
people do

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,599
um you know because they want to update

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,800
the design system that they were using

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,440
back in 2011

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,000
and use the latest stuff pattern based

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,200
web component blah blah blah

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,680
they'll often couple it with that and

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,359
then that also adds more time

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,880
and effort to the migration but then the

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,640
result that you get at the end will be a

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,079
lot more appealing to marketing and

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,200
and other people have to use the website

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,079
because a lot of people don't want to

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,640
just pay

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,160
especially right now for an it upgrade

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,920
they want it coupled with some nice

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,760
you know benefits and stuff like that so

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,680
oh on the pie chart i noticed rector

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
what is that yeah it sounds like a

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,240
horrible procedure you get at the doctor

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,599
but no

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,480
um rector is a a library for

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,640
uh automatically converting php code to

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
new php code very similar to what drupal

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,640
module upgrader does actually

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,079
but it's only for uh the latest

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,760
object-oriented php

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,200
because that's much easier to move from

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,680
one thing to another than the

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,319
kind of horrible things we had to do so

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,720
um

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,880
yeah what it is is it's an automatic uh

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:16,000
code refactor thing for php

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,839
which you can see here

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,280
um and it's it's a general purpose

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,119
library so you can see we're you know

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
we're on that list but symphony uses it

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,000
cake php

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,920
lots of different people a big move in

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,800
the in the drupal 8 space in general is

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,720
just kind of

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,800
jumping on the you know the the let's

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,480
find the best tool for the job and use

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,880
it instead of us writing all our own

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
stuff

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,319
from scratch so that's uh yet another

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,319
manifestation of that

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,200
um organic groups i don't know off the

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,920
top of my head and yes that is my cat

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,440
behind me sorry about that um if anyone

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,640
knows how to muzzle a cat i'm just

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,560
kidding no it's fine

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,319
um she's just very excited she gets very

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,280
excited about drupal she's been involved

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,839
in drupal for

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,640
almost as long as i have really so um

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,160
it's fine

00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,760
for organic groups i don't know off the

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,800
top of my head that is not one we've

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,119
managed to

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
dig into very much but i do know that

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,160
there is a project called

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,359
group typing

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,400
sorry um that a lot of people are

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,760
using in drupal 8 anyway to do the same

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,359
types of things that organic groups

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,520
module could do in the past

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,280
but i haven't personally used it um i

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,520
can't really vouch for it i would not be

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,599
the best person to answer that right now

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,880
but maybe by the end of the year i can

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,319
answer that for you because we'll have

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
it built into our thing to do it for you

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,599
automatically that would be the hope

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,280
um all right i think i'm at time thank

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,359
you so much everybody for coming

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,839
and for asking such great questions and

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,520
i will i will copy and paste this chat

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,319
and see if i can get uh

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,440
more answers out somehow um but yeah

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,040
thank you so much

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,359
have a great drupalcon and i think the

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,359
