hi everyone welcome back to the main

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,160
stage at drupalcon

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,040
on day three um i'm very pleased to be

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,360
bringing you this

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
next session uh from ben morse a

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,040
developer advocate at drupal

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,440
um he's going to be talking about

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
quantitative measures of user experience

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,279
the web vitals metrics that are used to

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
help us judge the quality of web

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320
experiences

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,840
so without further ado i'm going to let

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,400
ben take it away and tell us all about

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,120
it

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
thanks tim my name is indeed ben morris

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
i'm talking about

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
web vitals and some new tools and new

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,360
ways to measure web performance and make

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,960
your users happier

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,800
i have to admit despite what tim just

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
said actually there's an odd rhyme over

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
here

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
i'm not actually a worker for for drupal

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
actually i work for a different company

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,879
that almost rhymes

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
called google it's even called a slant

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,120
rhyme

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
coupon i feel like i'm at home you know

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
it's like a mighty part of the family so

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
i appreciate that

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
uh you didn't say i worked for like

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,159
wordpress or joomla or

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,119
typo3 or something else so i indeed do

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,479
work at google

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
i've actually made drupal sites before

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,880
though before i worked here and uh my

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,520
job is help the web be faster

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,200
and more beautiful and easier kind of

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
easier for developers to make fast

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
nice sites and easier for users to use

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
the web in general

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
you may see behind me also in my attic

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
here in this house in lovely new jersey

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,479
a bunch of music stuff which is because

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
before i worked for home happened

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,680
this was my attic music studio that's

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
where i am

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
pretty much all the time anyway good to

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
meet you

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
so your goal as a person who makes a

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,200
website use on mobile phones

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
for people to see your site and just go

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
hey this site is awesome

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,079
this content is great this design is

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
wonderful

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,320
this is useful for me and also look how

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
fast that loaded

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
that was so pleasant and a lot of

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
studies have shown this a lot of large

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,479
companies have done various studies to

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
show that

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,600
when a site loads faster people just

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
like it better

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,040
it's just they trust it more it's a

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
better user experience they just think

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,439
wow that was quick

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
somehow it's like your phone has to

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,360
respond to like part of your body

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
when your phone responds slowly it's

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,319
like you try to move your hand

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,920
and hook a hand move and like then it

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,640
moves it's just not the same kind of

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
hand

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
your phone is like that people wanted to

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
do things immediately whether it's like

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,040
you're using a messaging app

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,959
or something else or playing a game you

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
press a button something happens

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,560
when you press the button and say go to

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
this wonderful drupal site

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
and then it kind of loads up slowly and

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
the thing shifts around on the screen as

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
it loads

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
and then things pop in and pop out you

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,920
lose that experience

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,480
of wonder you get from the web also

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
if you're using a really high-powered

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
phone

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
like a nice iphone or a galaxy or a

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,000
pixel or whatever

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
on a nice 4g connection then web speed

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,879
isn't always as

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
important studies show that it still

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,599
matters but it's not as crucial

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,640
but a lot of users use phones that are

00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
lower powered

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,519
actually a lot of phones that are being

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
sold these days are not that high

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
powered

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,800
and these phones will execute code more

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
slowly and render the page

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
more slowly and they stress the browser

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
out more even find that scrolling with

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
animations and things like that

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,120
involved may just look kind of funny

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
and people may be also having slower

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
connections especially if you're in a

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
wealthy

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,920
country in a nice city if you're on a

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
train or on a bus or traveling somewhere

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
it could drop out i get that every day i

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,200
used to get that when i used to commute

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
to new york from new jersey

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
i had horrible connections for 30

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
minutes every day and no connection at

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,360
all when i was in the tunnel

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
if you're in a rural area you may have

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080
worse connections if you're in a certain

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
part of a building

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
and especially if you're in many

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
countries in the world connections often

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,599
aren't that fast

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,680
4g is common in many areas in some areas

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
3g is more common and the last thing

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
that i saw

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,120
last time i saw the numbers it was that

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
the average mobile page takes 12

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
seconds slowed on a 3g connection now

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
this is improved somewhat

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
when speeds when 3g speeds were lower

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,519
and pages were a little bit heavier

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,799
it was 19 seconds a couple years ago 12

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
seconds is better

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
it's still kind of a long time but it

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,640
could be worse than that

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,959
back when i used to travel places i have

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
t-mobile and t-mobile gave me the gift

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,479
of free

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
wi-fi in every country or many countries

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,079
in the world

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
but always in a 2g connection and on a

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,320
2g connection

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
many sites didn't load at all or took a

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
minute sometimes

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
and you knew after a while which you

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
could use were sites you couldn't use

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
and in fact last time i saw the numbers

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,960
on this in fact 40

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
of bubble connections worldwide are 2g

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
connections so imagine loading

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
a 2 megabyte heavy site on a 2g

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
connection

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,080
it's not going to happen so to make a

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
site that everyone can use

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
in different different places different

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
situations it's not accessible to

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
everybody

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
web performance is still pretty

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
important otherwise you've got things

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
like this where this guy is here at this

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
beautiful cafe table

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
trying to wait for your site to load

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
it's still not loading yet and look at

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
this he's taking up smoking

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
and drinking to cope with the stress of

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
watching this site load

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,320
so in order to prolong this person's

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
lifespan you must make your site faster

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
okay so there actually were some

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,759
wonderful talks yesterday on web

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
performance there's a whole session on

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,720
performance yesterday

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
or a whole i forget what it was called i

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,759
watched a couple of these talks

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
wonderful talks about web performance we

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,960
know that it matters there's many ways

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
to measure web performance

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
and you know what is it lots of things

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
out there

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
there's the load event there's dom

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
content loaded event there is a speed

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
index

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,039
first contentful paint so how do we

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,720
focus on metrics that seem to really be

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,720
the most important metrics

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
also there's more than just speed that

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
matters the other aspects for example

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
if your site loads up and people are

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,880
looking at your content and they press a

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
button

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,479
and nothing happens because javascript

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
is still waiting to get executed

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
or a long task is happening that's

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
blocking the browser from even sending

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,919
you the

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
event in the first place if your site

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,759
isn't responsive

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
it's also not a good user experience and

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
furthermore

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
if you're looking at a page i get

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
there's a lot these days with recipe

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
sites

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,919
you're looking at a page you lit up some

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
content and then suddenly

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
an ad pops in somewhere or an image pops

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
in

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,680
or even worse out of the video pops in

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
things all move around all of a sudden

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
contact can move down and move to the

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
side to make room for that new content

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
and the shifting can happen sometimes

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
four or five times during a page load

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
that kind of bouncing around of content

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
is also not a good user experience

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
and our speed metrics don't really

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,880
capture that we know that it's not good

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,560
but it's hard to capture that with speed

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,680
in fact you can't so

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
what do we do well a lot of folks spent

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
the last

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
couple years talking about this as

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
people do people at the w3c web

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
performance working group

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,800
people at google other companies

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
discussed these things for a long time

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,479
and came up with some metrics that they

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,599
liked which are called

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,400
web vitals web vitals there you go

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,880
and this is uh three metrics that people

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
have

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
aligned around that are good metrics to

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
measure whether your site

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
is healthy and performant now of course

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
these may change with time

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
they are iterative but this is the first

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
version of these

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
notices from a chromium blog and we're

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
saying here in the chromium blog

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
that google wants to have unified

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,360
guidance so our attempt at google

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,880
is to all discuss the same things which

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
doesn't always occur at a large company

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,599
you may have noticed before

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,319
if you follow things to companies like

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,800
google but in this case we've got

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,599
our ducks in a row thank you very much

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
because

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
also right around the same time there's

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,720
an announcement here

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,400
on the google webmaster blog over here

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
and uh they made a very interesting

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,120
announcement they said that

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,400
soon these cobalt vitals would be used

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
as a ranking signal

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
in google search so you probably already

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
are aware

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,720
that that page speed is a ranking signal

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
in google search especially in mobile

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
well that will soon be changing

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
to core web vitals instead not changing

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,759
immediately because

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,639
they won't get folks time to adjust to

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
the idea and plus due to covid19

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,840
people are working from home you can't

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
make big changes now on your site that

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,319
easily

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
so at some point in the near future

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
perhaps early next year perhaps some

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
other time

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
this will happen it'll be a new ranking

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
signal i'll have various links here

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
during this talk

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,879
there's a long link there on the bottom

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,319
i think i have more short links in

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
general later on

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,160
so this happened also notice in that box

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,520
over there the thing about the top

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,360
stories carousel

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,360
if you use google.com you may have seen

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,639
on the wrong tab here we go this top

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
stories carousel

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
all of these things here are amp pages

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
they're pages that use amp

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
a technology which is open source

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,560
started by google

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
mostly still developed by google but it

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,240
is an open source project that's now

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,839
under the family of the openjs

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,040
administration so openjs runs uh or has

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
it's part of the open jazz family

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,320
basically uh these pages here are amp

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
an amp is a is a web web components

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
library

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,600
that makes it simple to make fast sites

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
and has a lot of restrictions you can't

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
make

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
slow sites quite as easily everything in

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
this top stories carousel

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
over here is an amp page well this will

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,040
be changing now

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
so in the future the near future this

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
badge may change

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,959
and instead of this being just amp pages

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,399
it'll be any pages that meet web vitals

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,880
criteria

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,320
to repeat that these top stories will be

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,440
replaced by things that meet web vitals

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,040
criteria

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
now amp pages are still a pretty easy

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,959
way to get to these criteria because

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
amp pages tend to be fast and not shift

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,360
around that much because they're not

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
allowed to be

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,080
that slow without a lot of difficulty

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
but this is going to be a big change

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
so there's various reasons why web

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
vitals are important to

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
try to learn about of course the most

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
important thing really is make your page

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
better for your users

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
i mean i think it's secondary whatever

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,560
google does in search the most important

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,080
thing is a good user experience

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
but web vitals are hopefully a good

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
proxy for good user experience in terms

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,040
of speed

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,040
and stability and and uh interaction

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
so given that wonderful preamble there

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,519
what are web vitals

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
good question so the idea is to meet

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
these three criteria i was talking about

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,920
before

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
number one loading speed users looking

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,279
at your screen there

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,800
are things happening is it loaded is it

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,000
not there yet

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,320
page load number two interactivity does

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,279
the page respond to user actions

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,640
and number three visual stability what i

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
was discussing before

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
as the page loads up do things shift

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,040
around a lot or is it just like

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
it appears and there it is things don't

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
shift around

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
the core web vitals are designed to meet

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,600
these three needs

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
on the left over here the first one

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,560
largest contentful paint

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,680
uh middle there first input delay for

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,160
interactivity

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,360
and on the right cumulative layout shift

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
for stability

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,959
notice that these are measured in

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
different kinds of ways largest content

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,920
full paint

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
uh we think that good is two and a half

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,399
seconds or less before that appears

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
and then between that and four seconds

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,959
is pretty good

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
above four seconds you should try to

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
improve it first input delay we think

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
should be less 100 milliseconds

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,160
and cumulative layout shift is the

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,560
scoring which we'll be discussing

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,839
in a little bit so these are the things

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
you want to be able to meet

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,320
and the goal that has been set is that

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,200
75 of user interactions

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
meet these criteria now i've said user

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
interactions

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
these actually are being uh measured

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
from real data in the real world

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
it isn't on some server somewhere

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
sitting around at google or somewhere

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
else

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
this is from the chrome user experience

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
report

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
here's an article on that from search

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
engine land you may have noticed if you

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
use pagespeed insights to measure your

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,959
performance

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
that a couple of years ago they added in

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,360
something called

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
uh field data as well as lab data so in

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
the past

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,640
it measured performance based on there

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,640
were some servers somewhere and you ran

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
the site on some browsers and measured

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
what happened under certain simulated

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
conditions

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
certain speeds certain kinds of phone

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
speeds

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,160
certain network speeds and so on what

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,440
now is happening is that it's using

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,000
something called the chrome

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,680
user experience report which is

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,959
anonymized data from many many chrome

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
users out there

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,079
this actually is how real users are

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
using your page

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,000
and this data is accessible to everybody

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you can go into bigquery and query this

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
data and check out your site or any

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,639
site and see how fast it is how stable

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
it is and so on

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
so let's go into these metrics in some

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
more detail now the first one

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,639
largest content full paint again there

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
are metrics like dom content loaded and

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,920
load events things like that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,000
there was first contentful paint which

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
is useful but a loading indicator can

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,519
kind of trick that

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
first meaningful paint is a good one

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
speed index is a

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
favorite of mine for a long time speed

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
index web page tests used to determine

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
kind of how much of the stuff above the

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,120
fold was appearing

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
but it turns out the largest contentful

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,440
paint is pretty easy to measure

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
and a pretty good proxy for page load

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,560
and very easy to explain

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,040
speed index required using some calculus

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,160
to explain this simply is

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,880
when the biggest thing above the fold

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
appears that's lcp the biggest thing

00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,440
might have been an image

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
it could have been a video it could have

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,920
been a block of text a background image

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,240
the biggest thing that appeared when

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
that appeared above the fold

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
by about the fold i mean if you're

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
looking at a device the stuff that you

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
see

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
before you scroll down so it's kind of

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
intuitive you're looking at a page over

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,839
here

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
and the biggest thing that's going to

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,079
appear appears there it is

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,000
largest content full that's number one

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
so to see more about this i have a lot

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,040
of links in this presentation

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,160
to see more details there's a lot more

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,480
web.dev lcp

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,880
and then fid the text we have over here

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
uh first input delay also simple to

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,880
explain

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,279
is simply between the time when the page

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,399
actually is at first interacted with

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,600
until the browser

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,079
can respond to it so once the page is

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
painted

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
and things appear and things are on

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
there and the user does something

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
how long does it take for the user to

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,680
actually be able to do something

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,680
and get a response from that often this

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
is between the first contentful paint

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,800
and time to interactive but we think

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,279
that a delay

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
of more than one tenth of a second is

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
not that great

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
when have the user go there see a menu

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,199
button press the menu button and

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
something happens

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,839
for more information on this go to

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,600
web.dev

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,800
fid and then

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,399
cls cumulative layout shift uh

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
actually a little more complicated to

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
explain but simple to show again the

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
example there in front of you

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
there's a button there that's appearing

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
when the button appears

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,279
everything just kind of shifts on down

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
that's a bad user experience

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
this is measured by simply taking the

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
sum of all layout shifts that occur

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
as the page is being painted and adding

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
those things together

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
and each of those is measured as

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
followed is impact fraction

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
times distance fraction impact fraction

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,360
is how much of the page moves

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,920
distance is how far it moves measured as

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,320
percentage of the actual viewport itself

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,480
so if it moves if you have 400 pixels

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,360
high and 400 pixels wide

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
moving down to 200 pixels multiply those

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
percentages together

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,320
and there it is so again it's the

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,639
percentage of stuff that moves

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
times how far it moves and the sum of

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
all those things together

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,399
is called cumulative layout shift many

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,120
sites have a good score in this

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
some of them don't

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,839
uh what river this is repeating things

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,120
here ltp fid i'm confused everything i

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,880
press the wrong button

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,399
going on a little bit here all these

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
things again are from real

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
user measurements sometimes called rum

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
to be cute this is all based on chrome

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
user experience data

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,839
you also can measure these things on

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
your computer which you call lab data

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,519
and there's various ways to measure

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
these things again there's three

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,079
website urls there to have more

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,920
information

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:48,160
web.id lcp

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
and slash cls you can use the event

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
timing api

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,680
to determine fid and you see the rest of

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,519
the i'll read all the things that's on

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,639
the slide but there they are to find

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,600
more about these things

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,360
there's more information on on web.dev

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
the two links at the bottom tell you

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,880
how these were chosen and how we chose

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,079
the thresholds

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,560
the numbers that you saw and why 75

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,000
percent of people was useful

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
if you have questions also or you have

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,320
comments please put those things in the

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,320
chat because i may

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,839
look at those if i have notice over

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
there with things in the chat

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,959
i'll try to uh say hello and answer

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
questions or

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
take those things so it turns out these

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
things are useful

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,959
there was a test that was done they

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,480
looked at lots of different pager

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,000
impressions and found that i think the

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,720
meteos criteria

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
uh the user is 24 less likely to abandon

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
page loads

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,399
before the first content is painted so

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,160
as sites met these thresholds better

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
people stayed on your site more and of

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
course it's on your site more

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
they'll stay there for longer for your

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,839
content if you're selling things

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
they could buy more things the key is

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,480
the funnel of users is bigger from the

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,920
beginning

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
so if you have goals for users on your

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,440
site all those goals get met more often

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,399
if they don't just leave your site

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,600
because they're sitting there looking at

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,440
their phone and things are not loading

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,759
so then of course the question is how

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,679
about drupal

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
how do drupal sites do on these things

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
here's a measurement from a bunch of

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,400
drupal sites out there on the web

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
you can see we tested lots of different

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
sites out there the drupal sites

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
because this data is all available in

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,760
the chrome user experience report

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,000
you can do this yourself too and you see

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,280
that each metric is actually not too bad

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,079
lcp cls fid are

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,439
all met in most cases but of course

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
beating all three of those cases is

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
harder because

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,960
if you meet say a logic content full

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
paint and three quarters of cases

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
and everything else is three quarters of

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
cases then to meet all three is three

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
quarters to the third power which is 27

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
60 fourths

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,880
which is less than half so you see that

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,919
a bit less than half of pages uh they're

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,039
just desktop pages

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,760
past all three and less than a quarter

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,280
on mobile notice a difference over here

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,600
especially in first input delay

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,559
on desktop pages rarely ever a problem

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
with drupal sites

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,400
triple sets excel at low first input

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,320
delay on mobile

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
it's harder and of course the reasons

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,559
for that mobile sites tend to be

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,400
on worse connections and mobile phones

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,640
tend to execute javascript more slowly

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,480
than desktop devices do

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
so drupal sites do pretty well actually

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
but could do better

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,919
so how do we actually make that better

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
by of course measuring it first

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,039
how do you measure what vital scores

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
know what they are so you can improve

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,679
them

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
there are many ways to do this and once

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,000
again we have all of our ducks

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,520
in a row because there's various tools

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,039
that google offers

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,559
that do this and most of these do it

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,400
page speed insights which is a popular

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,760
tool for measuring these things

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
the chrome user experience report we've

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,440
been discussing google's search console

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,360
chrome and chrome dev tools lighthouse

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
and web vitals extension are all ways to

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
do this of course there are more but

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,520
these are six of the ways you can use

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,480
to measure these things now it turns out

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,480
that again

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
these things are measured by google with

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
this field data from the chrome user

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
experience report

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
you can't get those things in dev tools

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
because you're on your own computer

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
lighthouse also runs on your own

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,480
computer in general

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
so what you can get instead is total

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
blocking time

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
which is how long javascript blocks

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,039
things from running

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,960
which is a pretty good proxy for fid if

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
tbt isn't good fid will probably be

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,760
suffering as well

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
see what i can get all these metrics

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,679
more or less from six different

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,039
tools number one page speed insights

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
this is a tool that you may have seen

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,480
before you go to this pageview insights

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
page over here

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,320
you check you put in the url and it

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,960
gives you data on this url

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,919
it used to again go to google servers

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
run some tests

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
and give you the results now it does

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,960
that still but it combines us with

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
results from the chrome user experience

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
report

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
so you get a combination of this lab

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,679
data from running it on google servers

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
right now

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,080
and the field data from actual users it

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
gives you a score from 0 to 100

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,440
which often is talked about but i kind

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,280
of would ignore that score unless it's

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
really really bad or really really good

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,400
and consider more the kind of web vital

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,559
scores over here

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,760
how are these scores uh doing on page

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
speed insights

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
and also look at the advice it gives you

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,320
on how to fix things

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
this is from a site i looked at

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
yesterday i won't say what it is because

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,000
it didn't do very well

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,360
but there's a lot of things over here

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,559
yes you can test your site

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,039
as talk is going on uh this is this is

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,360
hard

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
making performance good is a challenge

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
so we'll be discussing some ways to

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,640
improve your performance at the end of

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,400
this talk

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,080
it's just hard because you can make a

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
site faster and then you add some

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,440
modules to your page

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
add some more images or large images by

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
mistake and it gets slow again

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
it takes some work there also are some

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,679
shortcuts we can discuss at the end of

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,760
this talk as well

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,280
so yes you'll find recommendations here

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
on ways to improve your site

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,520
for example looking at the top there

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,960
premium removing unused javascript of

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,799
course the javascript is there

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
and it isn't being used loading its

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,919
waste of time

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
uh looking down there a little or

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,200
further multiple page redirects of

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
course each page redirect involves a

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,640
network request

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,159
which can slow things down third-party

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,360
code is a common problem at the bottom

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
there of the page

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,520
trackers uh pixels all those kinds of

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
things you add to your page for business

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
reasons

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,480
that sometimes load before visible

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
content does

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
so there's that number two the chrome

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,320
user experience report

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,480
this is a little more for developers to

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,559
use again this is based on

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,760
real chrome users around the world and

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
data from them

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
you can use google bigquery to run

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,039
queries over here

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,480
you can visualize it in data studio

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,760
there's also an api

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:32,159
to try this yourself go to bit.ly slash

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,000
crux hyphen tool and there you go

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,440
in fact i did this myself yesterday it

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,360
was pretty easy to make

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,520
something here oh sorry this is not that

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
is this that no this is not that this is

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,679
yeah this is mine okay they're at the

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
top there's a little

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,760
chrome user experience dashboard of ben

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
so i just ran this thing really quickly

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
on google.com which is a site that's on

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,440
the internet somewhere

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,480
and saw that google.com had good lcps

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
the fid was good on desktop on phone fid

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
was a little bit slow so

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
interesting feedback to the google team

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,799
maybe watch the first input delay

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
pretty easy to use number three if you

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,480
use google search console

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,679
they're now integrated there too so if

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
you care about this for search

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,960
reasons in google for your search

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
ranking you can get a report

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,919
right there in search console and there

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
it is from the chrome user experience

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,440
report again

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,080
you can see this site over here had a

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
lot of good

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,159
results some that needed improvement and

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
some that weren't considered to be poor

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,600
so if you use a search console you can

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,120
do it there too

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
something else my favorite tool of all

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,080
is chrome dev tools this is an easy way

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,200
to look at your site

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,360
and to see what's going on so simply uh

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,360
go to network panel over there i like to

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,880
throttle to a fast 3g connection

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,640
that kind of thing and just see what

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
loads when it loads

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
and see what it seems like it's

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,480
extraneous or big this is not a devtools

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
talk over here i can't do a demo for you

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,600
right now because we don't have time

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,360
but you've used this before probably if

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
you use firefox or other browsers

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,320
they have tools like this as well

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
especially edge does these days it's

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,679
very similar now to chrome devtools

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,360
because edge now uses chromium

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
you'll find big javascript files

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,039
sometimes that

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
go load up before visible content you'll

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,600
find big images pretty frequently

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,360
just go through here find big files that

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
load up before things happen

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,760
and see if you need those files or not

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,679
if certain modules add those files

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,799
see if you can dump those modules or use

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,600
different modules that have less

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,120
javascript

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,039
or at least having them enqueue those

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,679
things on fewer pages

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,799
or enqueue those things not in the head

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
but somewhere else

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,880
on the page something else you can get

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,240
from devtools over here is this

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
performance tab

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
which has been around for a little while

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
it will show you the

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,720
film strip would just be somewhere else

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
you can now see actually

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
a little little snapshots of how your

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
site's loading and where it is at

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,200
various points so two seconds in are

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
things visible

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,320
four seconds in what's been painted yet

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,159
10 seconds in

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
what's been painted yet those kinds of

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,240
things that also now gives you

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,840
cumulative layout shifts you can see

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,760
there in red those things saying layout

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,120
shift under the experience area

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,960
it will now find when there are layout

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,559
shifting as the page loads and

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,400
mark those things for you until you even

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,039
where things have moved too

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
and give you a score so again you can

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,320
use this tool now

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,840
to get cumulative layout shift as well

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,799
as information about how long the page

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,919
takes to load

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,080
and first input delay

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,400
what else do we have here number five

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
lighthouse this is a tool that you can

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,279
use

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,640
to again measure all of these metrics

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,240
lighthouses api is also used by

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,440
pagespeed insights it's the same api now

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,039
so you'll see the same information and

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,720
both of these things

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,400
plus more information also in php

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,919
insights if you want to see more about

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,000
lighthouse go to web.dev

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,159
performance scoring it discusses how

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,679
these scores get calculated over here

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,840
lighthouse you can use right there in

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,440
devtools is one of the tabs now in dev

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,480
tools by elements and console there's

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,520
lighthouse

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
you can also use it as a command line

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,320
tool

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,440
or in a node module which means you can

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
actually use that

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,120
in a hold on the wrong slide you can use

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
it also in continuous integration you

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
can just have

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,159
lighthouse api be part of your part of

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,480
your uh you know before you commit code

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,919
when it's run a run a test see how it's

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,440
doing

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,960
also a new thing in lighthouse is called

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,400
house stack packs

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,919
they are adding in these things that are

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,799
specific recommendations for certain

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,080
cms's

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,919
there's now a drupal set of

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,520
recommendations so it will give you

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,600
recommendations that include

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,960
this drupal specific language like okay

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,960
i want to do this thing over here

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
what modules will actually do it i'll

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,320
get recommendations here from this

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,400
this is not lighthouse yet this is a

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,960
recent commit i'm told it should be

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,520
occurring lighthouse 6.3 which should be

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,720
launching relatively soon that should

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
then appear in chrome

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
if you're using it in chrome so it'll be

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
in chrome at some point in the near

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,440
future

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,679
it's not there yet but it will get there

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
soon

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,200
also number six my last way of measuring

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,440
these things

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,559
web vitals extension this is a chrome

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,000
extension you can get

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,960
if you want to get this for chrome if

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,840
you use chrome go to bit.ly slash web

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,600
vitals extension and this just gives you

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,080
all these measurements right there

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,279
in a chrome extension pretty handy any

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,320
site you go to the site

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,240
then pop in there and see the scores

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,159
this uses a javascript library you can

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,799
also use called web vitals

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,039
it's here on github it's open source and

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,880
you can also use that if you'd like to

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,400
in fact it's just wrapper around that

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,960
library and also

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,840
in fact you can do this yourself if you

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
just incorporate

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
vitals into your project you can then

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,320
import get cls

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,240
getifyd klcp whatever you want to

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,919
and go ahead and measure and log these

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,919
things it's pretty easy to do

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,120
also saying before continuous

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,960
integration the whole package for that

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,080
as well

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,200
lighthouse-ci allows you to integrate

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,000
lighthouse into

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
your ci workflow so if you actually have

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
a regression of some sort

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
if somebody in your team adds one

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,200
megabyte image to your site

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,440
you'll notice it by this integration

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
tool

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,960
finally too i made myself which could be

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
useful for you still this is like a

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,760
non-programmer tool but i found it to be

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
pretty handy

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,600
this is called speed daemon i made this

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,760
a couple of years ago

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
and people use it to run web page test

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
results automatically

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
actually calls web page tests api and it

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,400
gives you every week

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,919
or interval that you specify it gives

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
results here on your

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,600
site so if someone adds a large image or

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,039
something else happens you'll see a

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,720
sudden change over here

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,799
it also will alert you by email if it

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,880
exceeds specials you've set yourself

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,320
this uses web page tests i should

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,600
actually change this to use lighthouse

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,799
api shouldn't i

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
you also could fork the code if you want

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
to make your own version using

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,480
lighthouse

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
uh anyway this is just a tool that can

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,039
be used by non-programmers you can give

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,720
it to your marketers

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,480
they just have a spreadsheet it runs

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,840
automatically every week and they know

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,840
whether things have gotten slow or not

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
okay so that was ways to measure it a

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,159
lot of things over there

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,520
and now of course how do we improve

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,399
things

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,120
well improving things is good so let's

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,279
see here we are the thing is with cms is

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,520
that you tend to use a lot of modules

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,399
to make your website happen so these

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,799
modules

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,080
may add their own javascript and css and

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
they may add these things every page in

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
your site

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
whether things are used there or not

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
i've seen examples for example where

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
recaptcha javascript library is loaded

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,799
on every page

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
i've always only used on somewhere like

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,720
a checkout page

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,240
so it can be hard with the cms because

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,440
modules just do things

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,559
and you don't always notice what they're

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
doing one advantage though of drupal is

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,760
that i see i don't see a lot of large

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,960
javascript bundles from react

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,640
or angular or libraries like that so i

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
see less of those things but as with all

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,679
cms as you tend to see sites with a lot

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
of javascript and css

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
maybe more than they need so too many

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,279
modules can be a problem

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,720
but also this this tools here are

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,159
supposed to indicate lots of different

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
tools using build your site

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
maybe too many tools but also some tools

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,960
you can use

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:46,240
to improve your site so for example

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,880
what what causes poor large contentful

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,200
paints

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,679
things like server response times things

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,080
like render blocking javascript and css

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,520
resources that are slowed to load i

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,360
guess client-side rendering isn't really

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,039
a problem as much for drupal

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,399
but the other ones can be a problem

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,640
we're not going to discuss server

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,840
response times over here

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
it's kind of out of scope for our

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,120
front-end talk but render blocking

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
javascript and css

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,559
you can make this better by having less

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,080
javascript less css

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,480
looking at your modules seeing which

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
ones load a lot of javascript and css

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,520
considering using something else or

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
making sure they enqueue their

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
javascript

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
so it loads later on or using async and

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,159
defer

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
so things aren't loaded immediately so

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,480
the browser can choose when to load

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
things

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,440
we can discuss more about also this one

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,960
over here slow resource load times

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
things like images are still a big

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,399
problem on the web people often just

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,919
will load up large images on their site

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,960
not realize they're so big

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
and then they forget to make them

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,000
smaller ever i've done it before

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,360
even recently we've all been there uh so

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
of course the solution is

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,960
make the images smaller okay how do you

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,039
make them smaller

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
well of course if they're really big

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,799
choose smaller sizes

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,720
or compress them until the image

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,279
optimized module is a good way to do

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
this

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,720
also for something to run in your

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,399
browser squoosh.app is a wonderful way

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,480
to look at your image

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,919
and try different kinds of compression

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,760
make sure it still looks good

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,960
make them much smaller i've often found

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
that a large image can be as small as

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,640
like 30k

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,159
40k after using the squishdon app uses

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
webassembly to do this stuff all in the

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,039
browser

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,399
it's quite nice it's also important to

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,159
use responsive images

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,679
i guess the responsive image module is

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,960
good way to do this

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
responsive images means of course you're

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
not loading larger images on smaller

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,440
devices they won't use those things

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,919
you want to have a smaller image for a

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,720
smaller device and for larger devices

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,399
larger images try to use source set try

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,919
to use tools like that to make sure

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,000
that only the image that's appropriate

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,720
for the device gets loaded

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,679
and also lazy loading is a good way to

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,320
do this because

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,679
if things are being loaded somewhere if

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,440
things are being loaded early

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,360
that are images or whatever that are

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,880
somewhere down on the screen

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,640
then those things can block things that

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,760
already are visible when you're just

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,960
first loading a site

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
so you're looking at your site over

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,840
there things aren't appearing because

00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
it's loading things that are down

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,320
somewhere

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,600
off screen so try modules like lazy load

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
and blazi for this also now html does

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,039
support

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,880
lazy loading and images natively so you

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,000
should do this it makes things faster

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,200
makes things better for javascript and

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,600
css for those

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,799
for large javascript css files of course

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,760
less of them is better

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,960
make them smaller do you compress do you

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,039
minify

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,640
don't use modules on all pages if

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,519
modules only are applied to certain

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,519
pages

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,000
as they're saying before load things

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,399
later use async and use defer to load

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
things later really compressing is very

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,360
basic

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,039
minifying is very basic using gzip on

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
your server is very basic

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,120
set those things up it makes things

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,000
better i saw also this still is possible

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,559
in drupal

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,080
you can simply concatenate css files and

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,159
js files together

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,679
which is quite useful you can also use

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,919
the advanced css

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,760
js irrigation module for this purpose

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,039
this means you have just as much css and

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,880
javascript but you have

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,039
fewer files being loaded because they're

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,440
all squashed to fewer files

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,039
now if you use http 2 this is not worth

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,600
doing because http 2

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,720
does many requests in parallel the http

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,640
1.1

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,080
you should be taking your files and

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,679
combining them together

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,240
so you have fewer files on every page

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,159
so there's that number two what causes

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,960
poor first input delay

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,480
well it's mostly about javascript so if

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,440
there's javascript that's running for a

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
long time

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,480
it can block the browser from doing

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,120
other things the browser is single

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
threaded

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,640
javascript are single threaded so if

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,559
something's happening in javascript

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,159
and an event happens the browser has to

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,919
wait until your javascript finishes

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,159
to give you the event from the event

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,320
handler that can slow things down

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,760
also of course long tasks if you have

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,120
complicated javascript from a

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,720
complicated framework

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,480
it takes a while to execute that will

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,559
slow things down as well

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,080
so you want to avoid all the success of

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,279
javascript which takes

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,600
a long time to respond to user input

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,080
finally poor content layout shift cls

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
there's uh ways to make that better well

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,519
there's a bunch of things you should be

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,360
doing

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,919
you know web fonts can suddenly get

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,679
bigger and make things shift around

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,039
especially on the third thing over there

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
it's a problem you inject an

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,880
ad or something else in the middle of a

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,799
page i think shift around

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,159
those things are a problem but look at

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
things on the left these are probably

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,559
kind of easier to solve

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,159
the problem is that when things have no

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,200
dimensions declared in advance

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,880
the browser can tell how big they're

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
going to be so if there's no dimensions

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
the bowser sticks them in there

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,360
and things may move around to make room

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,440
for your new

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:38,000
image or your ad or embed or iframe

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,600
so how do we solve that back in the

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,919
olden days best practice was to simply

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,760
give

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,200
dimensions in advance because if you

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,120
give the browser the dimensions

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
it can reserve space for your image and

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,320
you are all set with that

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,559
let me grab some water real fast over

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,120
here

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,080
this is an old best practice specifying

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,159
dimensions

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
right there in the html but it's harder

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,399
now because your responsive design

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,600
you might just be saying width is 100 or

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,760
max with 100 percent

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
and then sizing it to the container in

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,240
that case browser is not big damage is

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,840
going to be at all

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,159
and the browser can't really size things

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,639
appropriately the new best practice

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,079
is to specify the width and height as an

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,280
aspect ratio

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,040
so this could be actually the wrong

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,839
width and height but the ratio is

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,919
correct

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,960
and the browser knows the ratio once it

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,560
gets the height

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
or the width you can calculate the other

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,919
one as well

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,359
so once it knows the container size it

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,200
can then calculate everything

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,119
and it lets the browser still go ahead

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,240
and leave space for things in advance

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,560
as you could before so for images do

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,760
specified dimensions as an aspect ratio

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,320
even if they're wrong for certain

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,240
devices if the ratio is always correct

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,599
then you will be all set and then of

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,320
course for different devices specify

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,839
different widths

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,159
different image sizes use a source

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,359
also you can use amp amp does all these

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,800
things here for you

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
amp is the open source project that

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,800
google started that uh

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,960
is a web components library i mentioned

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
before you haven't used it before

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,400
it does things like it requires you to

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,359
use dimensions in all your images and

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
other objects

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,440
so you'll constantly have ship is very

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,560
slow and also if you use valid amp

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
it restricts you from using much

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,119
javascript the javascript tends to be

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,480
lower

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,880
it does a lot of things make the page

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,480
faster to make animations smooth

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320
and tries to make all these web vital

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,320
scores good out of the box

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,839
that's what it was designed to do so i

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
recommend trying amp

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,280
the thing is that there's not like a a

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,839
lot there's an amp

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,359
module for drupal it doesn't do as many

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,240
things as for example the wordpress

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,760
module does

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,440
the wordpress i guess they call it a

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,480
plugin wordpress plugin is a lot of

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,119
stuff to help you

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,000
reduce your css and convert images amp

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,760
images

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
convert youtube videos to amp youtube

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,520
videos and so on and so forth

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,440
it guides you through the whole process

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,119
that doesn't only exist for drupal

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
but there's some progress in this area

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,359
the team that makes the wordpress plugin

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,720
for amp is now trying to extract the

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,720
post processor logic

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,640
into something you can use for any cms

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
so all the stuff they use to process

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,440
style sheets to do tree shaking to

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,359
convert things to the amp html

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,560
those are being extracted into their own

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,400
php library

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,599
which any php based cms could then in

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,200
theory use

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
if you're curious about this project

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,800
then check out this issue here

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,640
on amp project slash amp dash wp

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,160
we're almost done over here i think we

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,359
actually are basically done

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,280
so web vitals try them out again they're

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,920
things that google will be using to

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,680
as a ranking signal in the search but

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,960
that isn't really as important as a good

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,640
user experience

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
what matters most is that your user gets

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,359
to your site your beautiful site loads

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,280
quickly

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,000
and things happen quickly and for more

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,520
information go to web.dev

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,800
vitals and i'm ben morse that's me on

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,720
twitter

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,760
and i'll be around today so please say

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,119
hello at some point during the

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
conference

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,640
thank you so much thank you very much

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
ben for your presentation

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
um i have seen a couple of questions

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,680
come through and i may have one or two

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,040
of my own as well

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,960
actually um but let's let's see here

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,320
the most simple question is will you be

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
able to make these slides available

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
later if people want to reference this

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
information

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
yeah there's a lot of links and things

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,040
on these slides i think i said like 10

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,960
million words in 37 37 minutes

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,240
so yes i can share this if there's some

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,680
way to share it with people

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,760
i don't know how but let me know how and

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,440
i will make it available sure yeah

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
um if you send it to me after this i'll

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,320
attach it to the session node on

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,839
drupal.org so

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,480
yeah make sure that's available to

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,440
people um chris green makes a comment

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,079
that i think actually

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,400
becomes an interesting question uh which

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,320
does anyone else find lazy load content

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,920
annoying about mainstream sites making

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,839
it hard to use browser search or use

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,200
keyboard navigation as an accessibility

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,200
concern perhaps

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,119
or have content pop in i think maybe

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,520
there's a misconception though between

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
what's happening during lazy load and

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,640
some of the other things that can happen

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,000
in terms of content shift

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,680
so would you like to talk about that a

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,160
little bit more and and

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,040
how that affects your experience i want

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,880
to grasp the question

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,000
a little better but my impression is

00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
there are sites out there that say

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,720
things like

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,320
you know here's an amazing article click

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
here to read more and then you click

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
there

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,400
and then more things appear those kinds

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
of things occur sometimes

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
lazy loading if done right simply means

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,480
that things that are lowered down on the

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,560
screen

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,000
will appear before you get there or as

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,760
you get there but not

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,119
long before you get there so this is a

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,000
really good example if you have a

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,160
youtube video for

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
example towards the bottom of a page

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,240
youtube javascript is pretty large

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,079
and so is our css then to have those

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,280
things loading immediately as you're

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,000
looking at content

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,760
loading on the top is kind of silly it's

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
better if you scroll down your page

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,240
detects

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,400
oh we'll be there in about one screen or

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,920
so there's uploading the youtube videos

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
soon

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,880
if that was the question which i hope it

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,560
was thanks chris i'm glad i i got it

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,960
mostly right if you have a follow-up

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,720
please feel free to add that as well um

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
yeah the other the other comment in here

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,440
was just about

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,880
the loading equals lazy attribute and

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
john was mentioning maybe it's only

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,160
supported in chrome my understanding is

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,079
it's actually pretty widely supported

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,680
now except for maybe one or two

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,599
mobile browsers that aren't quite there

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,000
yet um is that something you have the

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,359
data on or can comment on

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
i've been following this but not in the

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,839
last couple of months i'm not sure what

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,079
the latest is on that

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,040
i know chrome did it other browsers were

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
doing it

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
people want to do it because it seems

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
like the thing which is useful

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,040
universally

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,720
so i'm not sure what whatever you're

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
looking to right now you can go to can i

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,720
use

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,079
yeah you can see where it is i'll post a

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,119
link for you there's actually a

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,400
drupal.org

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,119
core issue for making the um

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,520
loading equals lazy attribute a default

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,720
um

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,480
in drupal's core image handling api

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,400
in the wysiwyg and in the twiggy

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,160
templating engine and in that issue i

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400
think i have a link to the can i use

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,480
page that has the browser support

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,520
and the nice thing about that attribute

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,839
is that even if

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,680
um uh even if that attribute's not

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,560
supported the fallback is clean

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,520
in basically any browser so went to kind

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,800
of user i'm seeing

00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,240
uh chrome yes firefox yes edge now

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,880
uses a chromium so yes opera yes uh ie

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,079
is not under development anymore safari

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
doesn't have it

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,800
although there's an experimental

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,319
features in safari so maybe it's coming

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,520
to safari soon

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,359
and uh it's not there on opera mini or

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,680
opera mobile

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,520
okay it's getting there yeah i think

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,280
it's coming along and that's that's

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,119
one of those features particularly the

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,319
losing the loading

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,839
attribute seems like such a no-brainer

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,760
that hopefully we'll we'll bring it into

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,000
drupal and other places soon

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,920
um on that note actually ben are you

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
aware you know there's a lot of work

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,400
that google does in general to try and

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,880
find

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,720
creative solutions or to try and

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,920
introduce new web standards and promote

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,079
their adoption

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,319
like things like the loading attribute

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,800
um for performance in general

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,160
um do you feel like that continues to be

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,000
sort of part of the strategy

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,640
is like see what new standards can be

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,240
developed i know there's a mix between

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,920
you know how long it takes to get a

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,880
standard done and the need to move

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,319
quickly but

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,920
i'm curious to hear a little bit of the

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,520
inside yeah

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,040
that is the effort as far as i can tell

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,800
people are always talking to people out

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,319
in other places and trying to get web

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,839
standards to move along

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,760
but they are slow as you know and

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,880
they're slow often for good reasons and

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,680
often they involve a lot of different

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
people

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
different walks of life different

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
browsers and so on you see google trying

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
to make web standards to improve

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,040
performance

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,560
working other projects with to

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
pre-improve performance and also just

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
going their own way sometimes like amp

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,680
for example with a way of using current

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,480
web technologies to make sites that were

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,200
faster

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,839
and using a cache to make things faster

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
so

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,359
i think both both those things are being

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,359
done it's weird because

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,440
the web is so wonderful and so diverse

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,280
and so useful and people talking about

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,240
performance now for the last 10 or 15

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,200
years

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,880
and page sizes page loads haven't really

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,720
gone down for a long time

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,040
i think they began to improve kind of

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,720
recently but for years it was just more

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,200
and more stuff larger images

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,640
more javascript and that's actually i

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,640
think began to turn around some

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,000
that took a long time i i feel like the

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,480
trend was

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,079
as soon as your internet connections got

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,240
better the pages got heavier

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,079
and the experience just wound up washing

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,520
out to the same slow times instead of

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,680
really making traction

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,119
on actually improving which it's like

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,480
software

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
you know as you get more powerful

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
computers you get more complicated

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
software and layers and layers of

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,160
abstraction so things get slower all

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,240
over again

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,760
yeah absolutely well one last question

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,040
for you which has to do with what you

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,640
said just up at the front at the

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,440
beginning of the presentation

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,680
about the google site carousel how that

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,000
currently displays amp pages but is also

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,960
being

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,640
updated to display any other site that

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,920
meets the same performance standards if

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,839
i understand that correctly

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
right so that's a good way of putting it

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,839
yeah yeah so

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,680
if those sites are those standards

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,760
specifically published yet i know that's

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,319
still an active process maybe not ready

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,640
yet

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,920
in terms of these web vital metrics like

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,200
do we know if you meet

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,800
this first contentful paint and this uh

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,720
meaningful shift and all that those

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,079
things that that's the bar that you

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,920
clear or is that information that's

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,280
maybe coming soon

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,560
i would turn back to the official word

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,760
on this because this is all official

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,280
search stuff and search tends to get

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
very officially

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,560
so i'm going to go back to the slide

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,760
over here where i had the link if i can

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,240
find it

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,880
here we go there the webmaster blog over

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,079
there

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,960
this is the information that's public

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,280
over here corporate vitals will be used

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,040
what will it be exactly that's not clear

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
to me and how big will the signal

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,280
actually be

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,720
it's always going to be kind of private

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,599
because it's just google search never

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,760
reveals

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,599
how important something is i can tell

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,640
you that amp pages do not all meet these

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,240
standards either

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,480
so it'll be a matter of just simply

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,240
pages that have meet these standards

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,160
will get this kind of privilege and

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,720
pages that don't won't get it anymore

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,200
either

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,359
it's the final decoupling of the amp

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,240
from google thing amp is now openjs

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,599
project

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,680
again deals with working out mostly are

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,640
google engineers but it really be a

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,800
matter of

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,079
how good the experience is make it good

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,359
however you want to

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,720
amp is a pretty good way to make

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,920
experiences that are good but our

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,839
restrictions with amp so

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
you have to choose how to do it and i

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,480
know goal is just having better user

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,720
experiences

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,680
exactly and i know that folks may have

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,839
questions

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,040
further about uh performance and you

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,800
mentioned earlier that you'll be hanging

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,440
around the conference if people want to

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,119
try and message you the other thing for

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,200
folks who are here in the longer term

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,560
uh david strauss who's a drupal

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,160
community member and member of the

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,640
security team for drupal

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,319
is also i believe part of an advisory

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,359
board for amp or something like that for

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,960
that project

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,400
so he happens to be another person in

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,440
the drupal community that you might talk

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,119
about

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,040
if you're curious about that and how

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
it's become decoupled from a central

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,359
drupal technology

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,119
to its own open source effort but with

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,680
that i just like to say thank you to ben

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,920
for this presentation on performance

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,760
i will get back with the slides attached

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
to the schedule mode once we get back

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,319
around to it

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,160
but again thank you very much for the

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,040
presentation and for the education on

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,319
this material

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,720
and we really appreciate that you could

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,200
join us thanks for having me i really

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,200
appreciate it

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,839
bye for now

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,760
