00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,520
we're going to do a short introduction

who everybody is

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
and also they will tell us about their

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,039
projects

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,039
how they were involved in these crazy

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
times in the last couple of months

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
what has changed and we're going to

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,040
start with adela

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,880
and from open social yes hi everyone

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
my name is adela and i'm open socials

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
market development representative

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
give me a shout out in the comments if

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
you're familiar with open social open

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
social is built with

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,920
drupal and uh we uh my

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
my role in open social is that i take

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
care of all of incoming requests for

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
open social

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
so everything is usually on the first

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
point of touch and already at the

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
beginning of covet 19 we quickly

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
realized the increase of demand for

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
community software because

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
open social is community software which

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,000
helps connect members

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,799
companies volunteers and employees

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
together

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
and we also can do that very quickly so

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
we

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
had this first week and we also had to

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
start working from home of course and it

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
was the first week that we were working

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,560
from home

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,399
and biotechnology innovation

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
organization reached out to us and they

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
really needed a platform

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to connect the entities who have don't

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
have enough resources to

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,719
with with the resources who with the

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
organizations that can actually provide

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
these resources so needed something that

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
was really simple

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
that could host a lot of traffic but

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
also get the right information to the

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,879
right people

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
and this was one of the projects so to

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
handle kind of the crisis

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,560
of the covet 19 of what it did to the

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
world

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,800
and secondly we also had another project

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
that responded to the second wave of the

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
of the coronavirus which was a little

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,840
more for the economic uh

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
impact for for example poverty and world

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
hunger

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
so that we partnered with the united

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,879
nations which was also our existing

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
client already

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,480
and we collaborated on a platform which

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
is now spark blue

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
and that connects all of united nations

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,280
employees which is around 40 000 uh

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
employees and it also connects their

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
internal and external systems to

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
communicate together so they can quickly

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
get access to the data share knowledge

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
together and also quickly react on what

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
is happening in the world and save it

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
together

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
so my part in those projects of course

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,560
for the biotechnology innovation uh

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
organizations i was one of the first and

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
we decided to do that together we stayed

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
up very late

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,400
to also handle with the with the time

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
zones

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
and uh for the spark blue i was

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
supporting and i

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
just know what uh what happened but i

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,080
wasn't very much involved with it

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,280
with the project on hand but that's a

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,480
little bit about me

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,440
and i think we can um move forward cool

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,040

uk manchester

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
i'm here to talk about the arts council

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,280
for england

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
they're a government-based body

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
dedicated to promoting

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
the performing visual and literary arts

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
in england

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,879
and cti are proud to be have been their

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,239
development partner for

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,799
since 2017. the arts council

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,959
are responsible for ensuring billions of

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
pounds of government funding is invested

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
wisely

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,360
to help create art and culture

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,799
experiences for everyone

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,200
everywhere immediately prior to lockdown

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,080
the arts council had a really big focus

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,239
on the launch of their let's create

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,440
um 10-year strategy for the arts and

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,120
culture in in

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,320
england and sodasite was full of

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
very impressive and ambitious graphics

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
and

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,919
very much a vibrant website um

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
and very aspirational suddenly on march

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,960
the 16th the government mandated the

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,320
closure of all

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
arts and culture venues meaning in turn

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
that

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
there was an immediate and complete loss

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,120
of all income for many tens of thousands

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
of people in the sector

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
uh there was a huge and urgent need for

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
uh information

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,320
uh as the and as a central body for the

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,440
arts and culture funding everyone turned

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,520
their eyes to the arts council

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
there was a lot of uh yeah obviously it

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
was a rapidly uh changing situation and

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
the government were kind of

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
having to work out how to act but by

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
march the 24th several days later the

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,880
government announced 160 million pounds

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
worth of funding

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
to protect arts bodies freelancers um as

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,320
and freelancers the coronavirus uh hit

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
revenues

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
and it had to be made available by the

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
arts council website

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
so today we're going to explain exactly

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
how we achieved that

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
and thanks to drupal and their small

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
team uh how they went about

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
a nationwide emergency response and thus

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
helping to protect the livelihoods of

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,479
thousands of people in that sector

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,840
cool thank you great project then next

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,000
christina hi everyone um

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
i am christina costello i'm a lead

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
developer at redfin solutions which is

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,639
a drupal agency located in portland

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
maine in the united states

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
and i was the team lead and also a

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,800
developer on a relatively small but

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,319
important and interesting project that

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
we worked on this spring

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
we were approached by a non-profit here

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,440
in maine called the rural aspirations

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,520
project

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
and their work is really about expanding

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,720
educational opportunities

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,440
particularly in rural areas of the state

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
and particularly by connecting students

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
to community-based resources so

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,520
organizations around the state like the

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
audubon

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,240
and coastal heritage groups even

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800
individuals artists

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
and due to the school closures there was

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
um

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,360
a bit of panic around the state due to

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,440
the inability to meet in classrooms

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,440
parents and guardians suddenly had to

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,240
homeschool while working

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,400
while continuing their daily lives and

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
it was quite a struggle at first and

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
rural aspirations identified a need to

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
have a platform to connect families and

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,400
educators

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,800
to educational resources and activities

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
for students especially in rural areas

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
given that

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
connecting is difficult enough in that

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
case

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,599
so we uh helped them out with

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
a drupal 8 site they had been operating

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
on

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,000
a popular online website building tool

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,199
that they were outgrowing the

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
capabilities of they

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
were certainly starting to need a

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,919
content management system so that's

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,160
where drupal came in

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,199
and we had to do this very rapidly we

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
had less than a month

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
to take it from discovery to launch so

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
we used

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
just core and a handful of contributed

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
modules and stocked out of the box

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
functionality wherever possible

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,080
and an important goal for the site was

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,599
to allow organizations to enter their

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
own content

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,759
so that the rural aspirations team could

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,479
get back to doing their consultancy work

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
and working with the community directly

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,520
instead of spending all day

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,840
managing their new website so

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,680
we were able to do this really quickly

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
for them and it was a really fun project

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
to work on the team over there was

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
really

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
engaging and uh really passionate about

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,160
their work

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,520
and today they connect 95 organizations

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
around the state of maine to

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,560
students all over the state

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,919
oh awesome and last but not least

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,199
toby um hi i'm going to say good morning

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
because i'm based in

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,280
canberra australia and um it is

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
very morning here um i'm the product

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
lead

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
for amazing io but probably most

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,479
relevance to this panel i'm

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
also the the former technical lead at

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
the egov cms program

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
um here in australia those are not

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
familiar already gov cms

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
is a it's managed by the australian

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,440
government department of finance and it

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
provides a whole of government

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,320
platform for drupal websites um it's

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,040
been around for five years

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,440
and as of the other week there's over

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,680
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
frontline transactional websites hosted

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,480
on govcms

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,080
and these range from department of

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,640
health websites

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,120
information about government services

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,839
communications infrastructure

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
all those kind of normal government

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
things

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
at this federal level so australia's got

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
federal state

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,640
and local government um tiers

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
so we provide a a whole of government

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
service

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
for that amazing io and their partner

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,640
salsa digital

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,160
um provide the service to the

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,360
department of finance and what this

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,279
my part of this this story is is how to

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
handle

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:40,880
unprecedented demand for government

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,440
websites that need to be authoritative

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,959
people are turning to government to get

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,720
the information they need about

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,360
arts funding about coronavira statistics

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
about

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,640
education about employment

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
all of these things people are going

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
straight to the source

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,160
to try and find out what they need to do

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
so

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
it sort of started early in sort of late

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
in january

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
um we started to see traffic surging

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,040
towards the

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
travel related parts of government um

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
and you can sort of follow that curve

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,120
all the way through for the last six

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,680
months so

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
um what i'll be talking about is is how

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,440
the cms program

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,360
weathered that storm how the platform

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
that um

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,839
that was selected so lagoon is amazing

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,040
io's hosting platform

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,760
um why that was some of the decisions

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,720
made around selecting a platform that

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
is scalable and can handle i think the

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,680
original documentation

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,600
said momentary surges in traffic um

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
five months later that traffic is still

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,519
surging there was a really good case

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,839
study released last week

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,760
by the department of finance that said

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
some of these websites are seeing

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,480
600 increases in traffic and this has

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,959
been sustained for

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,600
um well yeah we're at now five months

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,160
and websites that we're seeing

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
a few hundred thousand visitors normally

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
in a month

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
um at the peak we're seeing tens of

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,440
millions

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
of visitors and those websites are still

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
seeing

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
tens of millions of visitors every month

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
so

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,560
how do you build a platform keep a

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
platform running but we'll also go a

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,320
little bit into the

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
the underlying principle of cms which is

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,920
that

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,680
um we'll call it create once and

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,600
share with everyone but there's a really

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,240
strong drupal community

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
inside government um here in australia

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,079
so we'll talk a bit a little bit about

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,760
how drupal has become really mainstream

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,800
in government and what the enduring um

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,440
the enjoying legacy of drupal through

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,240
this covert period is

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,079
cool thank you all right so the first

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
question i have for you christina is my

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,720
understanding that you built a

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
completely new website

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,880
for um that your project was about tell

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
us a bit like

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,800
what did you use in drupal why how how

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
helped or how

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,399
made drupal this possible to build a new

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,839
completely website

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
probably quite some short amount of time

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,519
sure

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,639
um so we have heard from

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,279
the content managers that they are able

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
to

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,920
uh set up accounts and train new content

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,959
editors in under 10 minutes that

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,880
the interface for those content editors

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
is extremely intuitive and easy to use

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
and that's been

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,240
what she called really simple but

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
powerful and how often have we had

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,639
clients describe

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
drupal as simple it's been really cool

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,000
to see that

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
we could set something up configured

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,480
with drupal that is so

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,160
easy to use and we were able to given

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,360
the small scale of the site to start

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,839
uh use the claro theme for the admins

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
and they've been delighted with it they

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,519
really

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
have had no complaints and uh another

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
big win

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
was content moderation being part of

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
core that

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,560
we were able to set that up so quickly

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
and they could apply a straightforward

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
approval process for their content

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
editors

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
so trusted organizations can add their

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,240
own content and then the

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
non-profit itself can approve that

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,760
content

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,959
we're able to do that so rapidly that we

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,360
were able to

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
spend a lot more time on the important

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
part of

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
discovery and ux and wireframing so that

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,760
we can be sure to build the right site

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
for them not just

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,959
you know any site to get it up and

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,560
running in the short time that we had

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,720
what was the reaction from the customer

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,680
i believe they were quite surprised

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
when they saw how fast you built like

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
whole

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,199
workflows of approvals and things like

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,959
that how did they react

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,800
they were really delighted they have

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,399
been endlessly

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
thankful for what we've been able to put

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
together for them

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
i reached out to them about this panel

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
letting them know that i was going to be

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,560
discussing their project and

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
asked them if they had any feedback for

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,959
me and they

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,720
sent just reams of

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
passionate responses especially from

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
community members that are using the

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
site

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
they have posts on their social media of

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
people thanking them for existing and

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,320
doing this

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,720
uh so it's been really cool to watch

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
well so drupal was a good tool set in

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,040
your belt too

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,399
and it sets them up for there's a lot of

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
long-term potential now that they're on

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
drupal so we

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
plan to layer in added functionality in

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,480
the future

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
we've talked about new features that we

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
could add using other

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,560
drupal you know just the drupal

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
ecosystem really

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,800
opens up a lot of opportunity there so

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
cool awesome

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,480
all right over to paul um so tell us a

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,720
bit

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
what have you built for the arts what

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
was the actual project how did it work

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,279
what did he use of drupal

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
to my guess my understanding is how did

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,680
the

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,279
um give out all this money that they

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,839
committed to

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,199
yeah and i mean that's partly what the

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,399
site is designed to do in the first

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
place is

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,639
uh normally they have lottery funding so

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
there's millions of pounds each year

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,800
that's um

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,760
issued out to um members of the uh the

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,880
arts sector

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,079
um but the site uh when we uh

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,279
went into lockdown was uh in this much

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,160
more um celebratory uh mode

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,519
um they pretty much spent the last three

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,240
months building out this

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,160
uh area their main part of the site was

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,160
about their new strategy

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
so they were in no way shape or form in

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
a position to

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,560
be able to service that very high

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,120
traffic um

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
so what they actually did was they had

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,560
this strategy

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
so phase one was the response so to try

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,360
and protect as much as they could in the

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,639
short term whilst they plan for what

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
comes next

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
uh so the first thing they did was they

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
changed the home page to put the minimal

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,279
information out and they put one page up

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,959
so that

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,360
there was a header that was put up which

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
we actually used google tag manager to

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,279
inject

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
rather than using drupal because of

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,959
course

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,639
we support many organizations and

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,160
all of a sudden everyone wanted our

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
developers so

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
because of quite a large company we have

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
people in the marketing team so

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,600
we had to be quite nimble uh in and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,360
clever as to how we

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,360
um created a an answer to these problems

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,120
uh because high availability was uh

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
really critical we needed to try and use

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
what was there rather than develop new

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,839
things because that would take time

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,519
and introduce risk and actually the team

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,880
at the arts council running all of this

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,000
is only two people

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,240
so um fortunately um in

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,279
in about 2017 we went through this

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,199
process of

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
redeveloping their site away from a

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
page-based paradigm

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,959
using drupal paragraphs so they did have

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,000
a library of paragraphs so they could

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,120
build out pages

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,360
to address different types of need

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
and so they stay pivoted from this

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,160
highly

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,120
and need heavy approach to a very

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
minimal

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
approach so that the the load time on

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
the pages was small and also it was

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,039
available on mobile devices much easier

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,880
and

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,439
and then uh yeah they had to

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
obviously pretty much build out a whole

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
site

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,240
to service the the evolving needs and as

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,520
government policy changed one issue that

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
they had was

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,959
and they created the initial application

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,720
forms

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,000
rapidly where they're using a sas based

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
service

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
and it all looked good and then they put

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
it out onto twitter

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
and then literally thousands of people

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,679
hit this service which generally remain

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,120
unnamed

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,160
um and uh there was this big uh service

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,600
unavailable uh announcement now

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,600
they phoned us up and said the website's

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
down but actually what it was was just

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,799
this uh

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
this link system so and the good news

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,000
was that we

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
actually had web form installed but it

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,840
wasn't being used

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
uh so we were able to rapidly train them

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,160
a bit like how christine has described

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,840
uh we we gave them some minimal training

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,679
and they were able to build out these um

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,280
forms themselves

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,600
um and one of the really important

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,720
things was that the um the way that we'd

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,919
redesign the site

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,760
uh was for high availability and really

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,799
crucially it was accessible because

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,640
all public sector sites have to be uh

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
compliant with the regulations that were

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
brought in in 2018

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,760
and and as the um the site everyone

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,640
looks towards they need to be seen as

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,000
setting the example and of course it

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
needed to be secure that we're talking

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
about applications where there's

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
millions of pounds potentially being uh

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
distributed

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,160
uh and uh be digitally inclusive so it

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,400
had to

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,640
not only be accessible but um be

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,039
available to anyone on any device

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
so and uh regardless of their internet

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,000
connection so

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,919
we had to work within those uh

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
legislations but also work really really

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,360
fast

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
thank you yeah

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,720
all right so toby question to you we

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,000
heard just web form

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,280
helped save the day you have an example

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
what tool module feature of drupal

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
helped

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,440
the australian government to survive the

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
million of people want to have

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
information

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,960
i think i think the important thing is

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
is that and it's rebecca a little bit

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,679
what christina said

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,760
the drupal can be simple um

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:27,200
so drupal is a very stable

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,799
content management system um where we

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,320
really were pushing the limits of what

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,480
drupal can do is how drupal

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
can utilize infrastructure and

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,880
particularly

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,240
we over the course of the the

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,480
as the project evolved we implemented

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,440
redis caching in front of databases we

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
were doing

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,640
um hot database cluster

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,000
upgrades in the middle of the business

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,799
day which

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,080
is normally an absolute horror story but

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,760
because we got

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
the team and because we understood the

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,520
platform and because we got the buy-in

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
from the um government agencies hosting

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,360
their sites

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,080
we could do this kind of stuff with

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,480
drupal

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,799
um and if you're looking at um

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,159
187 000 sort of concurrent users if

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
you're looking at tens of millions of

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
page views

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:24,640
every single percentage you can squeeze

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,640
out of caching so there's cdn's in place

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,120
all of our content editors are now that

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
much better

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,360
watching those numbers and working out

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
how to optimize and working out how to

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,120
do

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,480
image optimization working out how to um

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
and particularly i suppose

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,120
these sites are a mix of drupal 7 and 8

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,679
triple 8 makes it so easy with

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,880
the case tags to be able to do sort of

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
the purging and but

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,120
drupal 7 you've really got to be good um

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,360
and the level of the ability of drupal

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,320
to be able to serve these multiple needs

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,440
has been has been really incredible um

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
it would have been

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
the easy option to dump these sites out

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,520
to a static

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,400
page that you know can cache until

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,600
whenever but to provide that content

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,360
experience because

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
there's now three times as many people

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,919
editing content as pages

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,039
as there were before so being able to

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
the 10-minute training

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
it's really true for a content editor

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
someone can pick up how to edit a page

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,520
on in drupal

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,440
in 10 minutes so they can expand their

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,039
team they can get more people reviewing

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
they can sort of strengthen their

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,919
content management

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,520
workflows particularly the message has

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,200
got to be absolutely right and if it's

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,039
being read by

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,559
hundreds of thousands of people at the

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,039
same time it's got to be right

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,120
first time and drupal really includes

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,320
all the tools that you need to be able

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,400
to do that

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,880
so it was it was a it's been a really

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,320
good experience i think

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
cool thank you and andela a question for

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,960
you

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
we talked about now projects being a bit

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,559
special and coordination

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,280
how was your project my understanding is

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
you you usually onboard people like

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
that's a normal thing you do but how was

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
this

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,600
different this time for you yeah

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,120
so like our typical sales process

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,280
usually takes a bit longer

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,120
because then with the software of course

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,039
there's more stakeholders involved who

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,640
have to decide not only from our site

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,360
from open social but also from the

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
client

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,880
typically there is a few discussions and

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,880
we have to do multiple meetings to

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
actually align if it if it works with

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
the concept and if it works with all of

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
the policies

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,520
but in this case because it was such a

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,600
pressing urgent matter because

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,880
we've all seen it stores just started

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,799
running out of stuff

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
out of nowhere and that's the same for

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,640
hospitals and for

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
laboratories so we really needed to do

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
that quickly

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,200
and because the timeline for this

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,280
project was actually they reached out to

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
us the first time on a monday

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,679
and then on tuesday we scheduled the

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,760
first call on wednesday we set up the

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,799
platform and on thursday we were live

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,000
with the platform

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,520
so this was all done within 48 hours and

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,280
this was also considering that we're

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
based in the netherlands and

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
bio isn't based in the us we had to

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,960
really align with the

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,640
time zones differently and how to

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,919
communicate with a project

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,840
as well typically there's um

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,039
like contracting involved but in this

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,039
case we didn't really

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
have the time to do that so we kind of

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,200
said okay well let's just trust each

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
other

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,600
and then we will sort of solve these uh

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,679
issues later but let's just work on

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
getting this project live to actually

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,880
help people first

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,360
so that's what really stood out for us

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,480
there wow great

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,159
cool and how did you um

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
how was the reception of the people i

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,159
assume some of the people use drupal

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
like there are editors that create

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,000
m content we heard now that actually

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
many people said that the drupal is

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,320
quite easy to use to onboard something

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
is the is there something similar that

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,320
you saw

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,400
uh yes so typically it is a bit more uh

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,919
a bit more difficult to explain to

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
people how to work with it because if

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,200
you're not familiar with drupal it's all

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,880
of a sudden all these buttons and i

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,640
don't know what to do with them

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
but i think they were a bit familiar

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,840
with it at least the

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,520
contact person that we were speaking to

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,320
but the rest of the organization wasn't

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,240
so much

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,240
but we focused on the specific use case

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
so in this use case we use just a

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,840
topic and it needs to have the right

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,200
taxonomy and it needs to be assigned to

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,039
the right group

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,039
so this was just the workflow and this

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,120
is a really easy workflow for people to

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,080
understand and we also configured that

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,799
if a person

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,080
says okay i can i have this many

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,640
resources and i can share

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,640
it then it just gets automatically filed

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
and if they say i can i have resources

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
it automatically gets tagged with the

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
right

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,960
tags okay that's kind of also how we

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
customize it and how

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,799
drupal helps with that cool so very

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,120
similar to what we heard from you

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,279
christina that really thinking about

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,120
who needs to see which buttons can i

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,640
hide them can i remove them to make it

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
as easy as possible

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,080
for people that have never have seen a

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,760
drupal interface that could if you show

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
every single field and every single

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,320
setting could definitely be overwhelming

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,200
but removing them and making them

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,000
um easier for them so christina question

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
for you

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
um you mentioned that there was a whole

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
team one

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
question from the stage was how big was

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
the team that he worked in and also

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,400
maybe can you tell us a bit like how was

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
the project different

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,679
compared to others like did you work

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,600
different hours

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,120
because my understanding is also you had

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,640
to go remote at the same time

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,400
yeah so we had just all gone remote

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
we usually work in an office nine to

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
five all together um

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,760
so we grabbed what we could from the

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,520
office grabbed

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
equipment chairs things like that and

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
set up shop at home

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,200
and you know things were a little

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,240
uncertain for a while we were seeing

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
clients

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,559
make adjustments in how many hours they

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,440
were committing to work with us

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,799
but we fortunately didn't lose much work

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,279
in general we

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,200
got a lot of new work this one was a

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,039
great test case for us to

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,799
take a project from scratch to live this

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,520
quickly

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,279
working remotely refine our processes so

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,120
we could continue to do that

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,679
and we because things were a little bit

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,400
um you know we were adapting the

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,000
original

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,919
a team assigned to it was just a

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,320
front-end developer and a site builder

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
with me being the team lead so just

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,760
mostly managing the

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
discovery and user story aspect things

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,080
like that uh

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,880
the flow of the project but uh we

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,440
did shift uh the team around we shuffled

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
a little bit

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,080
and i hopped on toward the end to be a

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,360
power themer to get us through

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,200
in live on time so i did work

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,440
a little hard that last weekend to get

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,880
it up and running and looking clean but

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,720
uh it was pretty smooth so

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,400
about three months yeah nice good job

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,840
and paul um how did you work like how

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,159
how was it before

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,919
covet and during this project how did

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
your work environment change as a

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,400
company

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
well it changed for us and also for our

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,159
clients

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,480
and we pride ourselves on

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,440
the face-to-face relationship we have

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,760
our clients so

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,760
they're mainly um in manchester in the

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
northwest and they're down in london

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
and we spend a lot of time with our

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,559
clients particularly

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,399
in workshops and we have a specialist

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,600
a strategy team and user experience

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,559
designers and

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,279
so very much a close relationship with

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,960
clients

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,640
now obviously when lockdown happens

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,559
our entire team based mostly in

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,760
manchester uh moved to remote

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,080
and uh so did our clients um

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,799
so it was very much a new thing for our

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,279
clients

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,039
um but it was uh it's actually been

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,279
really constructive as far as

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,720
how we've managed to expedite

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,440
conversations they've been they're

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
traveling

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,200
and um so you know once the

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
their initial challenges around getting

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,120
used to these

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,559
different um online collaboration tools

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,120
was overcome is actually

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,120
the worst to everyone's advantage really

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,520
cool and uh and are you still working

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,440
remote today as a team

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,399
oh yeah yeah i mean we're not looking to

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,480
to rush back actually um

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,640
whereas traditionally uh cti has been uh

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
very much fixated on this office based

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,440
culture um

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,880
it is surprising uh as a manager

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,279
i seem to have formed a closer

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,799
relationship individually with all of my

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,120
team it's been a very positive

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,320
experience

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,279
cool um toby see my question to you

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,000
how was the remote work with the

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,720
customers

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,520
like for me as an out if i would put an

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
outside

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,960
hat on i would not believe the

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,440
government works from home

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
or like jumps on the zoom call in the

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,840
middle of the night how

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,679
how did this change like were boundaries

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,200
broken because of the urgency here

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,600
i mean i actually think it presented an

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,480
incredible opportunity um

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,799
the one of the things that was done at

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,559
the very start of the the pandemic as it

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:17,120
started to break out is that the

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,679
cms program identified that um

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
we were going to really need to closely

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,799
support

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
our content publishers and our agency

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,760
customers

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,159
so basically a sort of in was stood up

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,360
between the gov cms um team in the

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,640
department of finance

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
between the salsa digital

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,760
oh i think we lost the connection to

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,760
australia

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,880
let's we give it a couple of seconds

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
we always make the joke that there's

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,880
probably a shark somewhere that bites

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,399
the c cables so

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,240
looks like it's a good shark this time

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,440
all right let's continue um

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,960
adela how was it for you um

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,720
you mentioned that you had a remote

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
customer in another country even but how

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,440
did it change for the team did you used

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,120
to have an office that you all saw each

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,000
other

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,600
yes so we were already allowed to work

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,440
from home but we of course had a limit

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,120
as to how much we can work from home so

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,120
this was like only 30

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,880
and most of us did not actually work

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,399
from home because it's so much easier to

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
connect in the office and if you need to

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,279
say something you just turn around and

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,679
ask them

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,399
so also there was the first week that we

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,039
had to

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,159
start working from home and it was a bit

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,760
difficult

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,240
in terms of communication because um

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
we're quite used to just uh telling each

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
other things right after something

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,360
happens

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,640
and then in uh it's takes a lot more

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,960
time to write a message

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,559
than to say a sentence in person so that

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
was a little difficult we had some kind

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,600
of

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,720
uh at the beginning we had we did have

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,720
issues that like

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,080
teams decided something and forgot to

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,600
brief the other teams

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,159
but we quickly kind of made the

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,720
turnaround realized the mistakes and um

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,000
actually made it work and now we're

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,519
still working from

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,279
home partially although some of our

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
colleagues do go to work

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,720
personally i have to travel a bit

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
further to the office so i still don't

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,960
go because i don't i prefer to stay away

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,960
from public transport for now

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
but uh we're slowly getting back into

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
the flow and starting to open up a

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,960
little more

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,399
back into the world

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
all right slowly getting back to

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,279
normality

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,080
good and one of the last questions that

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,640
i'm really interested in is hearing

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,200
and do you have an example of how your

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,679
project

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,360
actually impacted the the people that

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,159
visit the sites or something that you

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,200
really

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,519
was unexpected that happened during

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,240
this project regarding people using

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,240
their websites

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:56,159
christina sure so i heard from the

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,720
nonprofit that owns the site we

00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
uh through this fight they were able to

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
connect

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,760
a portland-based comic book artist with

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,840
a rural sixth grade class and they

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,120
together virtually

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,480
created comic strip material

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,320
based on their own coronavirus

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,919
experiences and i think that's like

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,519
a super cool way to process what's going

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,640
on in the world especially for a kid

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,159
this must be

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,000
pretty confusing i know it's confusing

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,880
for me so

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
um i i thought that was a really great

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,039
story

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,320
and they have lots like that yeah

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,799
cool yeah maybe we should all learn how

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,799
to write comics to handle

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,600
i'd also remember these times because i

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,360
think we're gonna forget as well

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,360
and toby welcome back looks like the

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,480
shark that he's eating on the undersea

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,679
cable isn't wasn't that good

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,039
i got a message from my internet

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,760
provider saying they're experiencing an

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,960
outage

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,960
in the middle of it

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
i might just finish the point that i

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,399
started before i disappeared

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,880
and that's that um remote work has

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,880
allowed all of these teams to be

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,200
together in one place

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,720
as a normal thing so rather than flying

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
consultants around the world

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,720
and trying to get the right people in

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,679
the right place and tee up schedules

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
we're all available and so if someone's

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,760
got a question

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,279
they could reach out and we set up

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,720
groups on the various collaboration

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,600
platforms and someone

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
in an agency in a group with the

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,880
infrastructure engineers could say hey

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
we're thinking about doing this is this

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,159
a crazy idea

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,080
and i think that kind of collaboration

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,399
would have been really really hard

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,159
to do without us all being forced into a

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,279
more collaborative way so i

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,200
i think it's it's it's kind of laid a

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,600
path to the future a little bit

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,240
um made it more normal yep

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,039
definitely paul yeah i mean to answer

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,480
the question about the impact um

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,559
the uh the issues around the

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,320
whole art sector having to shut down was

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,960
was regular daily news

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,720
um yeah it was very apparent that some

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,560
people were facing a very desperate

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,599
situation as far as

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,760
um you know their personal finances um

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,520
but and that was specifically what the

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,679
arts council's role was but uh

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,200
another thing which really struck me was

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,839
um

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,919
it really uh brought home the importance

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,399
of the whole cultural and art sector

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,119
in people's lives and their well-being

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
and

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,119
there was actually uh a program ed

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,320
during the whole of lockdown with

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,200
grayson perry who's an artist and it was

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
engaging with um the members of the

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
public

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,599
and getting them um face timing onto the

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,800
tv program

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,879
and they really

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,879
yeah really sort of like doubled my

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,440
understanding of how important it was to

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,480
people's

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,359
uh mental health during this period

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,880
um and i think one of the the big

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,680
impacts will be that

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,920
out of this now that the government have

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
introduced this 1.57 billion pounds

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,920
worth of funding for the arts

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,440
it's actually going to reinvent itself

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,200
as it comes out and

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
be much stronger as a consequence

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
wow so would you say that this probably

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
has to do also with how good the website

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,200
handled that they now

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,440
invested more money in it yeah well

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,320
they've used the website to um

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,520
canvas opinion of the arts and culture

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,119
sector

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,200
they're both individuals and very large

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,240
national organizations as to

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,000
how that money should be in invested so

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,280
it's been like this public uh

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,119
a public consultation with the sector um

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,040
because of course this policy is

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,000
evolving as time passes they want to

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
make sure that

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,640
it's being used most wisely and

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,760
appropriately

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,000
cool all right adela do you have an

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
example

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,040
yes i was just going to say well like

00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,440
the

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,760
biohub what we actually saw like

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,839
immediately i started to get a lot of uh

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,440
traffic and of course a lot of uh people

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,040
asking for resources

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,200
and by now there are over uh 1200

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,160
members and the platform handled more

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,320
than 400

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,560
requests and that's how we know it

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,200
actually made impact

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,680
we of course don't have direct contact

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,480
with the

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,359
end users but i believe it made a big

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,599
impact

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,839
and uh with the other project that we

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,359
had with spark blue which connected all

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,760
of united nations employees which was

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,440
already i think that speaks for itself

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,400
to connect all of the employees all over

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,760
the world with

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
the world becoming more and more

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,040
decentralized now we're trying to get

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,280
it back together to connect

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:50,640
cool all right okay we're already

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,320
oh yeah toby go ahead um i think

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,079
the the primary measure of success for

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,160
government websites is that they're the

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,680
authoritative source

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,040
i think we live in a time when people

00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,760
get information from an awful lot of

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,560
places

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,760
but generally people trust governments

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,800
and for the websites that are running

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,359
on these platforms to to make sure that

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,640
they're the place that people go to um

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,000
they've got to be the place that people

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,119
go to to get the most current and

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,400
up-to-date information

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,599
um and the agencies running these sites

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,240
have to be confident

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,680
in their infrastructure i think what

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,480
this period has demonstrated is that

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,839
yeah government

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,960
can be it can it can we

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,359
we've all heard the stories of

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,599
government websites falling apart under

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,680
pressure

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,760
i think we've really managed to put this

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,119
to bed over the last few months

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,920
um and massively unprecedented

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,359
time but we've built sites and we've

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,520
built a platform

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,400
that can host this kind of surge in

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,520
demand

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,640
um so yeah i think for the agencies

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,560
being able to trust

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,160
that they can get their message out well

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,040
and it echoes a little bit of what

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
paul's done

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
there's a mechanism for making sure that

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,400
people can access the information they

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,560
need to at the time they need to

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,240
and yeah it's level of confidence both

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,839
ways

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,880
cool um all right we're already nearing

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,599
the last question

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,040
so for the last question for all of us

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,200
what is something that

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,280
you learned during this project or

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
during the pentamic in general is

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,720
is it for your company for you

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,119
personally that you really think will

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,520
change or shape the future

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,640
and how you work how you types of

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,359
customers

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,160
so a silver lining of all of the

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,520
horrible things that happened but um

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,760
that we find for the future

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,880
paul i think uh one of the things that

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,160
that's been a

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,480
triumph in this situation is that the

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,839
investment that the client made in

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,560
refactoring their site

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,760
some time ago and the way that we

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
approached it not just

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,680
solving the client will always ask for

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,960
something specifically

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,960
you know what they need and they'll want

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,760
a specific thing in response

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,520
what we try and do is to respond in us

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,079
in a way that's a bit more flexible so

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,200
that it's a

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,160
more an open solution and

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,119
and and what we did was uh it was very

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,079
fortunate that

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,280
we built a system which was able to

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,400
solve many different

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,040
challenges and i suppose what i'm trying

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,160
to say is

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,160
that yeah think

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,480
about the building flexible and open

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,599
systems that um

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,720
that there does help to solve the

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,160
problems of the future

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,160
and not just the ones that you face

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,160
right in front of you

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,400
cool so a manifestation that building

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,520
flexible systems will help you

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,599
in the future and that's something

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,119
you're going to continue to do yeah yeah

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,000
i think it's our responsibility as an

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,520
agency and as

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,520
maybe they do for projects they'll be

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,280
thinking much more broadly

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,160
um if the client doesn't always know

00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:00,079
what's best for them

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,440
um christina you mentioned that there is

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,240
that you actually got some additional

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,839
projects out of the one that you did

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,599
yeah um so this was a bit of an unusual

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,520
client for us we

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,319
typically do much larger scale work

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,640
with larger organizations and spend you

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,560
know

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,839
a good part of a year on a project like

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,560
this

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,160
so this was an opportunity to really

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,920
give back to our community right here in

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,960
maine not a lot of our clients are even

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,240
in our home state

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,760
so that was really i thought

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,880
a good move for us as a team

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,520
and as an agency and i think

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,880
another thing that i learned was it's

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,720
even though it can feel

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,480
risky you know logically it's the right

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,800
thing to do to spend a lot more time on

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,280
discovery in ux and planning

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,480
uh you especially as a developer i want

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,440
to get right in there and build the

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,960
thing but

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,119
um it's it can be really valuable to

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,200
be patient and take your time in the

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,400
beginning phases of a project so you

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,599
should you're sure you're building the

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,000
right thing not

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,880
spending time building unuseful features

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
things like that that's a good point

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,720
and yeah it has led to a um much larger

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560
project for

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,760
a much larger organization here in maine

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,280
so it

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,800
you know a referral made itself back

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
around so it's been good

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
cool good job and adela something you

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,800
learned

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,480
yes so it wasn't so much what we learned

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,280
knew from it but what it actually

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,599
confirmed

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
that was a real uh what about for

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,720
example that the world is becoming more

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,200
and more decentralized but we still need

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,040
to find a way how to connect everybody

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,040
and we also knew that with open social

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,440
we can set up platforms quickly but

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,000
also be able to prove it and actually do

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,240
it in practice and within 48 hours

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
we were also internally of course very

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,440
happy about that and also to see the

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,960
success of the platform

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,160
that's something definitely that we will

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,240
take together uh for the future with us

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,960
cool i think from

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,720
the largest takeaway for um for gav cms

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,920
is that we've now got

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,319
a large base of people who are used

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,240
who are now used to doing this to

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,359
building battle tested

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,359
sites and um

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,480
sort of paul echoed the how to um

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,640
it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,280
complicated um

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,960
simple wins we've now got a much larger

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,160
contingent of people who are singing

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,079
from the same hymn sheet

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,119
um keep it simple make sure that it can

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,599
scale

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,560
that's and i think having more of that

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,560
knowledge

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,839
across more agencies and across more

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,960
people um

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,359
it's going to be good and it's going to

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
demonstrate the ongoing viability of

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,079
drupal as cms

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,400
of the platforms we run and yeah

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,560
instead of being a niche skill the more

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,319
people that are scale ninjas out there

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,040
the the better it is i think

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,000
cool all right that's good to hear all

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,160
right i don't

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
i think all of you christina paul and

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
ella and toby for either

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,000
staying up late or getting up very early

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,640
um yeah thanks for sharing this deep

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,079
insights into your projects and i think

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,640
this showed um how drupal can help

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,640
in unprecedented cases is it now a site

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,720
that needs to scale a lot

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,160
need to build a new site or existing

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,760
tooling can

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,079
um enable things and that were maybe not

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,920
meant

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,680
for before so that's really good to hear

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,599
and i think gives all of us

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,119
a good feeling to go in the future of

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,119
drupal and continue

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,040
and using it and i think like we've

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
heard also like continue investing into

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,520
it to make it

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,960
flexible scalable and usable so i thank

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,960
all of yours um

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,480
and also thanks for everybody that

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,200
listened to us and

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
i wish you all a really good day thank

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,839
you

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,839
