experience designer

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,920
at lullabot so

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
generally known as the at the drupal

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
cons but we are a

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,840
web strategy design development uh

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,159
and support community a company excuse

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
me

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
it's fully distributed so i've been

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,720
there for about five years

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
doing ux for some large sale drupal

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
sites

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
georgia.gov recently georgia public

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,439
broadcasting

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
pantheon and the grammys so that's all

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,000
i'm going to talk about

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:59,520
about us i'm really here to talk about

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,079
uh sketching so i want to share ideas

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
uh this was my initial uh title i've had

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
uh sketching in ux but

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
the the point that is a little too long

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,440
for some of the

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
list components is that i want to sketch

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
to make decisions

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
and just get on with it in a process so

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,319
i know that sketching can be simple

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
as a concept but i wanted to get deeper

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,120
today into

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,440
a couple things that i've learned after

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,440
about a decade of sketching yeah

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so i had a lot of fun building this talk

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,680
and going through

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,200
a shelf of sketchbooks that i still had

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
so i did have to throw in just a couple

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,760
highlights to get rolling here

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,480
these are from college so doing icon

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,440
design obviously dinosaurs

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,319
octpie and some rocket ships for a

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
branding project

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
when i was an art director uh just

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
getting into web

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
you can see starting with wireframes but

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,920
really more high level

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,040
a lot of branding and some interaction

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
states in there a more recent fun

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
example

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,239
was for a hackathon called ludum dare

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,239
where you make a game in a weekend

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
and i did want to throw in one more

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,920
general point here

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,159
uh because my experience at least

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,840
personally lately has been that there's

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,879
a lot of unexpected

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
unusual stuff going on right now and

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
it's forcing us to adapt really quickly

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
so it's even

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
more important you know it's not a

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
hackathon but it's really important to

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
keep track of all the things and all the

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
plates

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,879
and and to be able to do it with less

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
effort in case you aren't running on a

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
full tank so

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
like i started this talk because people

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
said how do you keep your

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
your sketches so clean or this or that

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
and then i've also had

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,799
um you please i hope you don't mind me

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,959
going a little personal here but i've

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
i've had people in my personal life just

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,239
sort of ask me how i keep my like

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,879
s word together my stuff is together

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
and so the the reason uh the way that i

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
do that

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
um besides uh keeping my stuff together

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
with

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,760
an obscene amount of animal crossing is

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,479
stuff like this

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,280
is that my dining table is always full

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,160
of lists

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,079
often on the back of bills i have

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
calendars that remind me of things but i

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,880
need

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
some sort of visual layout and symbol

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
system to help my to help myself

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
understand

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
what fires that i need to put out today

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
in my own like 2020

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
dumpster

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,199
and so back to my sketchbooks

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,639
and away from what the back of my mail

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
looks like you can see

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,000
uh the topic is different now for ux

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,400
and content strategy projects this was a

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
large set of government sites on drupal

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
and of course sketching is still a big

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,000
part of that so i'm going to touch back

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
to this case study later on but during

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
this

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,000
some co-workers did have some questions

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,160
like the ones i just mentioned of just

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
some of my process and also shared some

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
really insightful observations with me

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,400
that prompted this talk so

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
thanks to them so to tonight i want to

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
look

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,560
at why when and how i integrate

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
sketching into our process

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,240
say tonight in providence rhode island

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,440
but of course

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,960
uh good morning and good evening and

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
good night such a thing

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
so if you if you want the tldr for today

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,639
and and you know want to switch over to

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
something else i think really the point

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
is that

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,560
in all of these examples that i'm giving

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
that are varied

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,479
and bizarre that

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,479
um i really have to sketch because i

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,280
just haven't found a better way

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,960
to communicate and to save things so

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,880
it's a really great way for me to

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
quickly note an idea for me

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,639
but it's also a really quick way to

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
communicate it with others and get

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
feedback and stuff like that so

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
i know that's not for everybody but

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,759
that's sort of why i'm here

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,520
my agenda i want to cover why i think

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,440
sketching rocks and why i think

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
you should too i'll try to keep my pitch

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
short

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,919
what sketching is for and the different

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,919
ways that i sketch

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,600
so you can consider which ones work for

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
yourself and then

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
go over a couple pro tips beyond the

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,400
like pen pencil stuff

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,160
um including uh what to do remotely

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,479
which is something that lullabot has

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
uh been thinking about for a long time

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
but i think is a little more top of mind

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
now

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
um and as i mentioned sort of a case

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
study

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
example

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,360
okay so um at this point my notes say

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,120
you know hand out paper

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
jokes on me so please

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,880
if you feel so inclined and you have a

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
little mental space

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
i would encourage you to enjoy this

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,759
moment where you can be at your desk

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,360
and doodle too if you have a little

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,160
notebook or piece of paper

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
um i would love to see any sketches

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
afterwards

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
it's a really fantastic sketch note

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
recently that has been you know like one

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
of the more

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,319
rewarding parts of this talk for me so

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
uh

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,280
yeah exactly i have paper in my printer

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
and a big stack right here for workshops

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,120
um from the before

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,360
times so yeah um i'd love to see this in

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,800
slack or in twitter or what have you

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,400
so thanks for that okay

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,960
why i love sketching i think that

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
dollars and cents this is a process that

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,599
offers a real return on investment

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
for your design projects because it's

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,639
super fast

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,840
it's a very light thing to do and so

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,080
it's cheap which is nice it's agile

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,400
so i think that is usually a nice cell

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
that it's not a really big process

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
and you can sort of work that in when

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,400
you need there

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
isn't a really big learning curve or you

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
know training required it's just that

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,039
you can sort of sketch at your level

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,360
so of course this is really relevant for

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,039
uh visual or ux uh sort of focused folks

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
but i think it's relevant to a lot of

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,919
other roles if you're in

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,639
content or product ownership

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,319
or project management or even developers

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
have said they wanted to like visualize

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,199
something complex

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,199
and so if you're trying to explain

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,280
something that might

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,120
benefit from mapping i think you know

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,440
you can you can apply this to a lot of

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
things

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,159
it also doesn't really uh require

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,279
expensive tools which is nice

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,760
so i i know if you

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
uh ask some folks they have like the

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,279
marker

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,040
and that's the one but and i think

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
that's amazing uh you know we joke

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
around like don't talk about whiteboards

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,760
because then we'll

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
we'll start but it honestly doesn't

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,600
matter

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
and i think that the best tool is the

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,160
one that you

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,320
have and so um honestly

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,519
one of the as i said before times on

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
sites

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,640
i had some ideas i remember i wanted to

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
work on

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,320
that we had discussed at a workshop

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
and prepare some things for the next day

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
so honestly i went down to the hotel

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,920
lobby

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,880
and i took a big sack out of the printer

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,120
of paper

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,200
and excuse me and then i used the pen

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
that they gave me in my hotel room and

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
that was enough

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,920
you know the the client wasn't asking me

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,800
about the tools or the training

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,800
you know it was enough

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,360
it's also fast to understand uh beyond

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
fast to make

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,000
so i i have definitely been guilty

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,760
of writing these 70 page briefs uh

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
and i know that not everybody's going to

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
read that maybe i make a bulleted list

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
at the beginning and i hope people read

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
that

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,640
but it really is easy to grok a visual

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,519
flow of something

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,800
um and it's just less mental energy for

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,839
the other person

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,839
to you know get that communicated across

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,360
i love that it's really iterative you

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
can quickly make new versions you can

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
modify something i've seen people

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,160
literally tear them apart and put them

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
together

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,600
i fold stuff and it's gross and it

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
doesn't matter

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
it's okay and i encourage you to make

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
something really messy

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
and uh because it's more easily

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
modifiable

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
so eventually you're going to get there

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,839
and you need it to look nice but

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,160
this is a time that that's okay and one

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,480
one point that i want to raise there is

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,720
uh especially as a designer

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
doing you know beautiful comp sometimes

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,480
of a website it can be really hard to

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
throw something out that didn't work in

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
testing so i

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
like that sketching sort of sets up that

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,880
expectation to

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,640
kill your darlings and sketch four of

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
something and only use one so you're

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
inherently going to throw out three you

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,760
know it's just easier

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,000
to find i think a better solution

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,560
okay so i'm going to assume that you're

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
all sold

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,120
and now i'll go into a sort of beginning

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
to end through a project

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
the examples of how it fits into my

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
process

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,040
discovery so uh this is a big

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,839
section of lullabot i love

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
um the onset that we do often as part of

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,519
planning work

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800
for upcoming projects or strategy sort

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,920
of consultations

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,279
these can take on a lot of different um

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,440
that's great a lot of different sorts of

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,200
forms and variations of groups and

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,839
sketching and activities

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
but they usually really fall under the

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
theme

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,240
or the thread that we're just trying

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,639
to understand a problem we want group

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,800
consensus we want everybody to agree

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,720
we want to write an sow that makes sense

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,920
to everybody if we are planning

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
something really

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,600
major and so i had written we try to

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
solve the problem but first we just need

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
to understand that

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,480
and comes back again to

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
clarifying assumptions to reduce risk

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,120
and really help with

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
project planning

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,560
it's a bit of a mess but i wanted to

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,959
make this point somewhere

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,399
somehow and so i wanted to show that

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,200
especially in discovery

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,560
when a client is just telling us all the

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,800
stuff

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,079
sketching is really huge to just take a

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,440
note to just sketch

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,360
a concept maybe a thumbnail or

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
something i have to follow up on but

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
just somehow digest

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,720
all of that information that we're

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,079
getting or things that are coming up

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,959
so this is just some notes of mine from

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,440
like a 20 person demo a couple weeks ago

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
and

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
uh so i guess you know the way time is

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,639
passing now

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,120
uh you can see oh like june 29th

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
when even was june you know it's really

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
nice to have these notes

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,079
and just use them not as this visual

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
thing but just as

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
a quick shorthand for me to remember

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,200
what we were talking about when i picked

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,279
this up again

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,040
but more specifically on this slide i

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,440
was going to show that

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
i'm developing my own shorthand and

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,959
everybody should think about

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
what serves them because i know that a

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
queue requires

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
client follow-up or a star means

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,880
something or arrows or

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,959
sort of a decision flow so um i

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
i hope that you you know there's lots of

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,360
guys out there and great resources for

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
that sort of thing if you want a starter

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
but

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,000
it's interesting to think about what you

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
want to clarify

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
okay lots of ideas lots of ways to

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
generate sketches

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
um and work through ideas with sketching

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,760
so i'm going to scope this

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,800
right now to the familiar topic

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
of generating wireframes so let's say um

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
the the lullabot team the design team is

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,560
going to do a remote sketch session

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,839
to build out some wires

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,680
the way that most of our wires start is

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
actually these sorts of paper docs that

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
we call presentation models

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
so i'm going to try not to go at least

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,639
second to the whole research here but

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
we have some key audiences key user

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
tasks

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,839
which are balanced against the business

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
needs we have sort of different pages or

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,720
components built out this way

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,399
and uh tons of research that we've we've

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
gathered previously so

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
again sketching is often about

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
putting ourselves in front of this sort

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,920
of uh fire hose of information

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
and then quickly being able to

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
transcribe that visually

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
so then we're looking at this

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
information and

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
knowing that we need visuals for the

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
hierarchy

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
or the flow content or how that layout

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
really

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
appears when we sketch

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,199
this fake workshop is a half a day

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,880
so it looks like a lot of time together

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
but i did want to make the point

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,199
that we aren't like on the phone the

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,399
whole time so if we're hopping on to

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,639
a google me or zoom what have you um

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,560
we will go through our presentation

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,959
model circles for the day

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
as you can see sort of a briefing and

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,040
then

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,680
go off to sketch so sort of put our

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,519
cells on mute go away and and have our

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,279
private time to just sort of focus

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,600
i also wanted to point out that it's

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
short you know we start with 15 minutes

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
and as

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,279
the team gets better it's often 10. uh

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
just

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,800
real quick real focused come back and

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
then

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
take some time to review together i also

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
wanted to recommend

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,079
that you take some time for a second

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,560
sketch session

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,680
after that review period even if it's

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
five minutes

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,079
or if you do two sketch sessions and

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,440
then sort of a

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:55,120
you know revise of a and b two

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,440
uh what have you but i think that you

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,360
have a very amazing opportunity when you

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
hear the feedback of your team

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
and your co-workers and you can jot down

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,680
ideas or see what they've done

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
and really iterate from there and having

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
to stop and move on

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
really misses a lot of opportunity as

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
i'm saying so

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,560
definitely take a little more time and

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,560
record those things before you go on

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,360
specifically going through that process

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,759
this is kind of what

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,759
my my notes look like at first

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,759
i got the question you know how your

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
sketch is so clean and i chuckle because

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
this is what they look like at first and

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
so

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
a lot of thumbnails that are very close

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,199
between

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,880
the bulleted lists and the actual comps

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,360
i'm trying to create

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,160
thumbnails then i'm iterating and trying

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
to clean that up

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
and show the team something that looks

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,399
like a page and it doesn't originally

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
have all those notes on it but as we're

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,880
walking through it in that review phase

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,240
we are coming up with a lot of ideas or

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,959
making decisions

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,639
and then finally that has this longer

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
page which you can see sort of cut with

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,480
the squiggles

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
that has a little more detail and those

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,079
questions answered

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,480
um finally if we want to take this

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,319
wireframe from the sketch session

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
digitally i mean you can go as far as

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,199
you want

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
i'll talk a little bit more about this

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
in the tools section but

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,079
i guess for process reasons it's great

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,760
to do this

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
if you want to keep iterating without

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,079
drawing a new sketch

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,039
and you can again get very messy with

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,000
this of

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,600
uh cutting something up in photoshop or

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
just duping a bunch of things in the

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
list and calling it a day

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
and flattening it you know i've done it

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,240
and it looks fine because it

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,799
communicates what you need

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,559
but there are fancier tools if you

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,679
really want to get into

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,039
building vector wireframes but yeah i'll

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,039
go i'll go back to that in my

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,840
um shiny object section later on

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,960
okay so as far as the the people in

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
politics side

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
uh this was a really interesting

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,600
discovery for me

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,799
so i had noted that i

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,840
will primarily sketch so far to take

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,640
notes for myself

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
and to start working on on a design

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,720
concept

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,520
but it really was a fairly

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,280
internal or personal experience it was

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
to help me complete my work

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,480
or to work very closely with designers

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,520
doing the same

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
work but i found lately that

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
there's an amazing amount of

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,960
collaboration that can come

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
from sharing visuals from meetings or

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,559
notes or

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,840
workshops in different activities you

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,000
might be participating in you know

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,760
there's a lot of ways to do this

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
so i just wanted to show some examples

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,679
of how it can help

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,840
more than one person um

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
this is uh some these are some sketches

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
from actually my father who's an

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,200
architect

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
because he doesn't relate to a lot of

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
the the web work that we do

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
uh but there are certain things that do

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
overlap

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,679
and one of them is like this phrase i'll

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,240
know it when i see it

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,600
which is sort of this issue of chasing a

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
client's moving target

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,440
of what success might look like so

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
there's a lot of different ways to

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
define that but

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,880
what i really like that he does is he

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,200
has um potential clients out for lunch

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,559
if he wants to do an architecture

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,160
project remodel a new new house

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,440
and just hears them out and a lot of

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,559
times they'll say okay i figured out

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,799
what my project is

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,760
but then it's kind of crazy so it's like

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
a futuristic

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,400
vintage like boho tiny car

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,640
what what is that and so you know i he

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,679
might not have the shared vocabulary

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,240
of the the uh the industry right and so

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
um

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,880
my my father gets out a legal pad and

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
starts sketching at lunch and

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
you know the client is loving it because

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,919
he thinks he's getting all this value

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,600
over like chips and then uh

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,039
my dad loves it because he's deciding if

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,880
he wants to go in on this

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,240
with this client make this commitment

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,160
and really um

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
skip over that so that now they have a

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
shared vocabulary and they can point and

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,760
do this sort of this not that

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,720
and really narrow down uh their

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,440
direction together

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,559
so you can kind of avoid those surprises

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,559
and those moving targets

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
i love how collaborative it can be when

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,679
everybody sketches

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
it's a really helpful way for others to

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,799
communicate things they

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,919
might not think to so when you can

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,240
i think having stakeholders and

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,960
developers and everybody in between

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
participate

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,200
and i have heard a couple clients say

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,880
this is like an engaging activity that

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,799
you know seems to be really beneficial

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,799
for the workshop so

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,400
yeah i think that's great uh as well but

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,120
my favorite is really more

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
that having development involved early

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
and showing

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,679
their sorts of implementation or

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,520
experience recommendations

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,080
it can curb a lot of those um really

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,120
large overhead or not performant ideas

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,440
that we might sort of

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
fall in love with early on like i joke

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,960
that i'd really rather have my bubble

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,960
popped and have it popped early

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,240
to that point uh these were some

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,679
examples of sketches that actually were

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,799
from a lullaby product and so there is a

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,080
sort of developer a back-end developer

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,280
for one of these and a business

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
stakeholder for the other

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,000
and they did end up influencing that

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,000
final product

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
a compromise sketching together is

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
breaking out into small groups

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,480
one possible put a job eating at each

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,919
group uh you know but we do try to have

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,480
someone that is more comfortable

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
or internally to the team um but it

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
helps you combine different perspectives

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,840
like we're talking about here

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
also if you're if you're strapped for

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,240
time doing these small groups can let

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,679
you

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,440
divide and conquer across multiple

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,200
tasks of pages i did want to make the

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,159
point though that this was not always

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,679
the situation

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,159
and you can collaborate with sketching

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,520
even if you're the only one sketching

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,360
so sometimes you know maybe you're just

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
hurting a lot of cats at that workshop

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,360
or people are uncomfortable with

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,720
sketching in particular or maybe just

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,799
like the website

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,360
process in general so if i can we're an

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,039
in person at a workshop i would like to

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,919
stand up at a white board or a sticky

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
pad and

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,320
and ask confirming clarifying questions

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,159
and then just visualize what i'm hearing

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,280
so you were trying to describe that as

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,440
being the marker for the group is still

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,039
helpful for ways to

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,960
use sketching to visualize what they're

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,120
saying without forcing

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,120
a marker into to their hand

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,400
i just my question about an application

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
that i'm recommending and i'm curious uh

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,679
if there's something that you mean in

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,280
particular what i had been

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,440
referencing previously was figma

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
and i'm using a remarkable tablet for

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,600
some of these sketches so

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,360
that will come in um but honestly a lot

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
of what i

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,480
am talking about is yes thank you the

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
sharpie

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,960
a post-it um and and i do have a tool

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,280
section that i'll get into

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
but it really is you know what's at your

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,559
desk and

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,000
and what is your client comfortable with

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,000
yeah so that was actually perfect

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,799
going into documenting um this is a way

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
that i have been starting to sketch a

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
little more

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,000
and it's very different than this sort

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
of in-process artifact that i was using

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,520
and then throwing away

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,360
but we're almost using it like an

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,360
initial round of deliverables

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
this is again about communication but at

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
a later phase of design

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,039
i believe that dan maul said this better

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
than i did

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,919
or will but uh when we do these static

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,440
photoshop comps of websites in his

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
example you know we're not actually

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,000
making websites

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,600
we're just making pretty pictures of

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,880
websites so i you know

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,080
switch over to um a mindset of

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,720
communicating

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,919
or really documentation to document how

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,679
to build that website

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,960
uh i think we can really focus on what

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
is important without

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,679
wasting a lot of time on the

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,000
presentation of the design

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,919
so as obvious as it sounds uh ask

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,799
yourself where is clarity needed you

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,200
know what

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,360
do you specifically need to recommend

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,760
and what are you adding to your comps

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,799
that is just distracting to stakeholders

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,720
so again um keeping it messy can be good

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,000
it can also encourage stakeholders to

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
provide more honest feedback

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,799
because it doesn't look so nice

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,640
and and like i say the content might be

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,640
less distracting excuse me

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,679
i like to start as far as my fidelity

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,760
with something like this

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,080
you can see that the image on the left

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
is just a box with an accident i used to

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,640
draw with the image was

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,440
and then they would have discussions

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
about you know if if that should be that

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
exact

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,720
uh race that we want to show that runner

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
from and those kinds of details um

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,080
that can take away from sort of the

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,159
wireframe

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,640
goals uh you can see there as well

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,440
heading one goes here like this

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
i don't want it to be too distracting or

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
to

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,919
talk too much about copy that can be

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,520
edited in a cms later

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,159
i'd rather tie it back to a style guide

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,919
or

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,880
a hierarchy of information so i can see

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,200
maybe instead of having one it says

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,159
compelling actionable case study title

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
goes here

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
you know that sorts of things that are

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,400
that are helpful i think is great

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,760
um but if you try to to label that case

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,840
study you might get a little stuck

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,880
um also you can see sort of my squiggly

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,600
metadata

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
uh links for boxes and um things like

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,159
that

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,520
um and um yeah i think i think

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,679
if you if you go through that question

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,600
each time you can sort of hit that sweet

00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,159
spot each time

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,039
now to relate this to your style guide

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
uh

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,559
something that i struggle with is maybe

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,640
leaving a mistake in a comp where

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,120
there's some extra padding and now

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
you know someone has a question of if

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,240
that's new

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,760
and we need to build that in and so i

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,240
think that um

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,360
using a sketch that's vague and giving

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,200
yourself a little wiggle room

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,039
is good uh because you can be leveraging

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,000
your component library and referencing

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,600
your existing patterns

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
so just to that point you know i've made

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
that mistake of is this a regular button

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,320
because there was just a little extra

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
space

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,799
no i wanted i want to literally right

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,919
here this is just the primary button

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,159
that is referencing an existing system

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
so a huge disclaimer here um you know

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,840
with all this knowledge sharing

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
yeah this these sketches are great i am

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
an advocate but

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,600
wireframe sketches don't give us the

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,600
full picture because we need to

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,360
create a finalized pattern library out

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,640
of these to really make our components

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,080
final

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
so that we have something that we're

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,039
referencing that we know what's going

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
into these sketches

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,840
so we need to show

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,559
our design aesthetic and type systems

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,960
and color

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,000
and you know very specific ui within a

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,039
style guide

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,640
so that that can you know not force us

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,039
to assemble everything together

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
every single time and then really the

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,080
developers are the ones that are

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,559
bringing this to life so that's the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
magic

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,320
section uh there was a session yesterday

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,440
called big systems big

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,159
problems that i think

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,000
dug into this really nicely it was kate

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
and carl so look at their recording if

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,320
you didn't get a chance

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,320
to see that live

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,600
so um another point i want to make here

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,600
is just that i want us to get away from

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,279
the expectation of creating these full

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,039
page comps for every single thing

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,039
i think there's a lot of simplification

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
that we can offer here and and sketching

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,880
is one of the tools to

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,760
to do that so you know this is this is

00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,840
not a new

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,520
argument that it can be a little

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,720
difficult to have

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,919
a sketch and

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,120
comp pixel perfect versions

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,159
of a page at every size at every

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,320
iteration

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
of different interactions that have

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,760
various states and show all of that

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,360
and then make one change and have to

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,679
ripple that through

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,600
all of those but then we get into these

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,760
sort of complicated

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,120
variables with the opportunities that

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,640
drupal affords

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,679
now you know when you are building

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,720
a landing page for a client and you want

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,159
to explain that

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,840
it's going to be done with layout

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,640
builder with a really robust set of

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,960
components

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,120
you know what what should you do you you

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,679
know you have the option of comping

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
every single version of this blog post

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,039
out

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
with its you know extra guacamole as

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,039
they've described it here

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,799
or um you know what i would do is push

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,440
towards a sketch of two page layouts

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
like this

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
with a bunch of arrows in it so that

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,799
it's a lot easier to just like agree on

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
that concept and go off and then build

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
the thing

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,080
instead of having to make all those um

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,760
first and then build a thing

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,640
because i think even if it is possible

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,559
it's just not as effective

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,840
now just really it's a little further to

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,600
drupal it's another

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,440
reason we don't want to be hyper

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,279
prescriptive with our comps

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,200
uh the same way that i had said you know

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,039
i just want a button here

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,240
i have definitely experienced that

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,240
before where

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
our team has designed you know a

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
beautiful

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
piece of ui maybe in a calendar picker

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
or a schedule

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,360
something like that and then this

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,799
component ends up getting shelved as far

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,039
as the front end because we

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
find something out of the box that is

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,600
great uh it doesn't need those specs

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760
because

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,120
it is you know totally different

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
implementation

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,159
that followed this robust ui phase where

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,399
we could have had a lean sketch with a

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,559
box that says the calendar goes here

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,840
and then found what you know we were

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,399
going to do at that point

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,399
later on

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
i hope everybody saved up some money for

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
this talk because it sounds like we're

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,159
getting uh

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,679
quite a bit of products ready i'm really

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,720
excited about that and you guys are very

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,880
ready for the tools section

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
so i have been very excited you know

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
focused on and excited about my role as

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,080
a designer

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,240
but i do want to talk about how these

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
artifacts were leveraged by other people

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,679
so um you can know kind of what to

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,679
expect when the pieces fit together

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,559
so all these lean wireframes i'm showing

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,840
allowed us to create this sort of design

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,720
systems checklist

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,520
which was one of many spreadsheets that

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
we made

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,000
so uh this was great because in this

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,080
project for example we were able to

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
i was working with a support designer

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,840
doing ui sort of running

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,520
off with things that i had started the

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,159
ux for in tandem

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,919
so this allowed us to track the work

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,120
what was highest priority what was still

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,440
remaining to do

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,799
you know and really assist with project

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,399
management for design

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
and just allocating stuff within

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,919
ourselves it helped with getting

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,480
approvals to see what was ready

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
and needed client review and and all of

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,720
that

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,279
here we have some content annotations so

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,640
again i love this because it's ugly

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,480
um but it also does work so um what

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
uh the content strategist and i were

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,559
doing were essentially

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,559
working on a data dictionary and like

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,039
content modeling

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,720
at the same time as a page building and

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,279
working on wireframes so

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,559
we were able to validate them and test

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,279
against each other

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,399
so here he is annotating against the

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,480
content model

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,559
and seeing how we might want to make

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,200
some edits or what needs to be automated

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,760
and then

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,440
you know adding those details to a

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,080
particular field you know those kinds of

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,519
things

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
which was great to just make sure we

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,559
were on the right page before we

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,279
got too far and i live you know a

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,039
spreadsheet

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,320
but i do think that uh sometimes these

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,360
like ugly things can

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
speak a little louder

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,399
and finally uh these annotations served

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,039
as for back-end development so

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,559
uh as well as content strategy so you

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,080
can see like we're just marking all over

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,000
these with numbers

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,440
i think it's okay that they're a mess

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,399
you can get really fancy

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,960
if you want with sigma or envision is

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,919
great

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,919
because they have cont comment features

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,159
and you can color code them that this is

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,480
a dead note this is urgent and

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
stuff but you know the the point still

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,679
works here

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,600
i i love this one because if you can't

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,640
read it the comments just says i don't

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,640
know what this is

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
and so we were able to go through the

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,880
rest of it and see i understand how this

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,480
works

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,519
and then just prompt a conversation

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,640
while reviewing the rest of the

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,320
documentation

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,919
and it you know we figured out what goes

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,919
in that sidebar and how it's populated

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,360
okay we made it i can't wait to hear all

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
about the rocket book

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,840
so as i said you really can use anything

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,080
i do think experimentation is great as

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
far as tools for sketching

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,360
because you just find what's more

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,640
comfortable for you sometimes

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
i really like forcing myself to use a

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,760
big

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,799
chunky marker to help you you know move

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,720
really fast

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,559
but maybe sometimes you just have to

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,159
have an eraser

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
and so actually this is going to be a

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,200
blast because i'm stuck at my desk

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,360
so i'm going to give you um a couple

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,399
examples of my tools

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,279
i'm really sad i just had a um a vincent

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,320
van gogh

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,760
ear eraser um that i cannot get my hands

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,600
back on that's in my

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,720
my pile of desks somewhere so there's a

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,840
couple things like that that are just

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,080
fantastic but

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,080
i'm going to show you a couple so um

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,320
let's see the most basic thing

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,279
is just you know i said that the thing

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
you have with you

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,960
um is the best and so um i really like

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,559
these little

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,480
uh i'm like the sponsor uh field notes

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,240
are an erin draplin product but they're

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
just like really tiny little books that

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,399
fit in a pocket

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,919
if you have pockets and then they're

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,879
doctorate as well which

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,480
i know we've been talking about yeah

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,720
those are nice

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:23,200
if you don't want to go full on digital

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,119
i also like to use dot grid or some sort

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,480
of grid uh when i sketch

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,240
you can get really fancy about the

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,000
templates that you use so

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,359
um we have a couple that we use for

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,599
responsive design

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,119
that include um that include uh grid

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,440
widths and that kind of thing

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,440
um sketch eyes is a good one for that

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,359
that has just things you can print out

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,440
notice also that there's a name of the

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,839
project and a date i would also put your

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
name

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,480
and maybe what page you're working on or

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,560
what concept this sketch session was in

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,560
because we often lose track of those

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,800
things

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,640
space pens are awesome i just had to had

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,440
to shout out to that i love that

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,680
except they roll off the table uh the

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,079
jotnot app is very cool

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,160
uh we we struggle a lot with a problem

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,520
of the you know the on-site together

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,000
somebody goes home with that manila

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
folder or we have a remote

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,160
uh review like i described and now we're

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,720
losing

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,160
um it because the call is ending and we

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,440
didn't actually get a file unless you

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
took a screenshot of this

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
you know screen share or something so

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,760
jotnot is a couple bucks i think it's in

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,880
before

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,520
5 usd but when you take a photo

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880
it allows you to skew to the corner of

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,079
the page so it is

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,599
correctly uh proportioned and then uh

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,200
really ups the contrast so it kind of

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,119
looks like a nice uh

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,839
scan and then of course you just have to

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,280
put it into like a google folder or

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:47,680
something

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
i really love dry erase boards i'm not

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,320
just going to like

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,760
pick one up right now yet

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,359
but i like these because they sort of

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,200
force everybody to stand around them and

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,720
like make a decision and then leave

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,320
you sort of expect that you have to

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,160
erase it when you're done

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,359
and it's it's okay to sort of iterate on

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,880
top of each other and

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,680
and reference it as well um

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,359
another thing that is nice in a similar

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,359
way are these giant pads

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,200
of like sticky pages like just like

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,040
giant post-its and so of course like

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,079
post-its on post-its like it's very like

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,720
mtv

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,640
tv show um but i really like these if

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,280
you put them up on

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
the wall and just sort of keep going

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
throughout

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
the you know maybe a workshop of a

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,680
couple days

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,440
and you can really quickly reference

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,240
what you were discussing

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,720
or what your persona activity resulted

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,800
in

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,839
when you're making this tone decision

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,839
for example

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,359
okay so i uh i actually do have a

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,359
whiteboard that i'm just gonna pick up

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,800
so one of my co-workers um did this very

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,839
cool thing

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
and it's bizarrely simple he's laminated

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,200
paper

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,560
so this is a jeff eaton laminated these

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,359
11 by 17

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,400
pieces of paper and dry erase markers

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,119
work on them

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,000
and it's really fantastic to like hand

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,520
them out

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,680
they sort of fit in your suitcase

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,119
backpack you can wipe them off

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,720
but you take a picture first of each

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,599
side you know it's really

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,400
it's really handy um so i really do

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,280
recommend that

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,000
um and then i have this little um these

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,480
little

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,440
uh markers and yes i absolutely love

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,359
this idea

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,040
that you could laminate anything so you

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,839
can combine that with your dockrid

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,400
or you can combine that with a you know

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,320
blank

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
image of your website with a header in

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,640
it you know or

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,640
whatever you want to get creative with

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,960
so i often get this question of how i

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,640
keep my uh sketches so clean and

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
straight and i always kind of laugh

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,680
because i use like a straight thing

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
so i don't even mean a ruler um so let

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,480
me just find here in my little bag of

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,880
tricks

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,720
um so this is just like a a name plate

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,760
that i had a long time ago

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,599
um and i put these little dots on this

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
um and so literally this is often my

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,160
ruler

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,160
it's just like over something from

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,440
recycling you should be throwing away

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,440
um so i'm going to put this right up to

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,040
my camera and see if i can show you

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,000
um i have some some marks on the edges

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,000
here

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,359
that look like nothing but these are

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,760
actually um

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,880
the widths that i use for wireframe

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,560
pages

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,040
and the content grid within the

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,480
wireframe so if i have to sketch a

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,560
really long page

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,520
across multiple pages of my sketchbook

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,680
or something

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,359
i know that they're going to line up

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,680
when i like frankenstein them together

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,680
later

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
that is a thing

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,960
um and yes i literally have been using a

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,200
christmas card from all about for years

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,200
as a ruler because it's just always here

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,240
oh since i didn't since i don't always

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,960
have a live demo

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
at my desk okay so the final one that i

00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,599
really like

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
and i do want to say they're not

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,839
sponsoring

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,040
the talk is this remarkable tablet and

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,480
so i'm going to show

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,920
you what that looks like it's a fairly

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,119
light

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,800
small e-reader tablet um this is a

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,560
picture of the cat

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
in it um and so i can have like

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
notebooks and folders and different

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
things

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,920
um i did use it to um complete this talk

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,359
and it does have a couple really

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
interesting features

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,480
of you know being able to lasso

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,599
something and move it

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,800
or duplicate it you can email yourself

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,480
you can have

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,119
um mediocre transcripts like

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
speech or excuse me handwriting to text

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,040
but the best thing about it is

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,040
that it allows you to to send yourself

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,800
svgs and sort of sync them

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,240
so you can sort of quick view it as a

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,680
pdf sort of thing

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,800
or you can um send yourself vector files

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,240
of all of these

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,680
these sketches so that is uh how i'm

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,839
getting into these fancy

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
figma files um and so i will say again

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,079
you know i

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,160
they didn't sponsor this i would love

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,160
that um but there is the remarkable two

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,160
i believe coming out later this year

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,839
uh of course it's been a little um a

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,839
little delayed

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,119
okay so i had touched on this before but

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,920
i did just want to repeat in the tools

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,839
section

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,079
i do think it's really important for you

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,880
to use um

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,480
whatever ui program or design program

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,280
that you're already using that you like

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,720
to use

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,000
um you know familiarity is important

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,440
uh figma is cool uh envision does a lot

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,640
of the same things there's a lot of

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,640
different programs

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,240
i've been using axure and it offers a

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,720
lot of the same features and i was

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
really

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,000
pleased with that so you know whatever

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,800
you use great um

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,839
but yeah it can be you know a hacky

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,920
photoshop or it can be

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,599
something something vector like this

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,880
just a starting point for

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,880
the design down the road

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,560
as far as specifically remote tools this

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,800
is going to sound

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,000
like a right you know sort of kicking

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
the can but

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,119
just use what you actually use already

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
so

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,640
there's a lot of artifacts that we use

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,560
to make these happen

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,079
long video calls are important so

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,960
whatever your screen share

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,800
of choice is uh we prep notes in advance

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,359
as you saw and then we take more live

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,560
so whatever your document of choice is

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,119
we like paper

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,240
um we're trying a lot of different video

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,760
tools

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
and then you know make sure that you

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,599
have a folder

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,920
of um somehow to share these so

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,800
google drive dropbox is is pretty common

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,640
for us

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,680
uh sometimes it's just a photo album of

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,319
the day uh and i did wanna just say

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,560
slack again uh because we really like

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,839
sharing in there as sort of a timeline

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,839
so let's say we have a three-day

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,280
workshop and not everyone can attend

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,359
um it's easy to keep up in slack

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,800
or i want to refer back to it later or i

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,880
want to start a thread on something

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,319
um i've been surprised that that is less

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,260
of a mess

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,760
than i thought it would be um

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,760
[Music]

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,599
yeah um so i just thought like really

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,599
quickly a question fly by

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,800
can you ever see yourself going 100

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,480
digital with your sketching and

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,960
wireframing

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,240
possibly i mean that's pretty close to

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,440
what we're doing

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,160
um but not all the time it just depends

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
um

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,839
i haven't i've been liking the

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,280
remarkable tablet it's pretty close

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,520
but you know sometimes i'm just going to

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,720
draw on a napkin i suppose

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,440
i hope that helps another tool i did

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,839
want to share

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,720
i was disappointed to find um my

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,240
specific one is actually discontinued

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,319
but i am using an ipivo uh camera

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,839
and so what it allows you to do is um

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,000
place a document here

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,960
and then uh or a notebook and sort of

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,520
gesture

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,480
um and tilt and focus and take photos

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,960
that way as well

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,640
so you can do a live presentation or you

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,440
can you know sort of use it in place of

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,160
a scanner

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,240
um so mine was about eighty dollars and

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,040
um it looks like now you can really

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,800
um choose how luxurious you want your

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,000
document camera experience

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,319
to be but it is really nice to just like

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,160
poke a pencil in and be able to

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,520
write down a suggestion or a thumbnail

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,079
of what someone's telling you in real

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,200
time

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,200
and have that feedback

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,960
okay so really quickly i know i'm almost

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,599
at my time here i wanted to

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,400
um show a quick case study

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,040
georgia gov we did a lot of sketches

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,200
just taking notes as wireframes and

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,440
i did some just trying to keep up in a

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,880
conversation i thought i couldn't

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
and then i found that actually sharing

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,640
them with others was helpful

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
in the previous example it gave us the

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,560
work uh for the wires and in this one it

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
helped me validate something and got

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,119
people talking

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,920
and finally we got to actually do page

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,000
building

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,280
um with some content editors using

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,480
sketches and these

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,400
um little white uh whiteboard sheets

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,680
so it allowed us to show them page

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,920
building and

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,800
um validate the components that we were

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,200
designing

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,800
so you can just see how you know them

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,520
sketching a sketching

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,359
of taking notes working collaboratively

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
there's a couple different variations of

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,480
how these fit

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,839
together yeah so that's my feel um sorry

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
to go over just a little bit

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,280
i did want to note that this is really

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,760
personal so please take in

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,920
and leave and just pepper in what you

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,599
see is maybe having value

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,440
and of course make sure that this is

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,720
seamless with your team and with your

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,839
clients you know you want to set

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,200
expectations

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:49,440
um so that everybody is not expecting

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,760
the perfect comp and of course i really

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,319
scoped this to wire so um i'm going to

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,040
throw in one more example here

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,599
um this is why i can't go just digital

00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,680
because

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,040
i uh just drew this on the back of some

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,359
stamps last year

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,440
um but it doesn't matter that it's messy

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,720
because this wasn't the deliverable

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,079
my deliverable was this

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,839
uh halloween costume for my dog

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,319
to become the coffee cup from game of

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,640
thrones so you know it was okay that i

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,920
drew

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,319
something really messy while i'm on

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,599
youtube um because it allowed me to

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,000
deliver what i needed

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,079
um so yeah my point being keep your eyes

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,520
peeled uh for weird places that

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,359
sketching fits into your life

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,839
yeah um so um i i don't know if anyone

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,839
can

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,200
can stay for for questions hopefully i

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,720
don't get booted yet

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,200
um but thanks and i i also want to add

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,280
um

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,119
don't forget please the drupalcon

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,680
evaluations i would love

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,480
feedback and i would love any sketches

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,680
if anybody

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,880
uh did a thing uh please share a thing

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,920
thanks again have a great night uh do we

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,119
have time

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,040
for questions

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,240
let's see oh there's so much to scroll

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,240
through i'm so excited

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,400
i see some people uh having some

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,920
concerns about sketching and i want to

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,960
encourage you to

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,560
to make a mess and and aim for ugly

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,680
uh because then you're not disappointed

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,280
um yeah recommending figma for example

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,040
um i am recommending pen and paper

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,520
i'm loving seeing some of the apps that

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:42,560
others are working on like concepts

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:44,400
good notes um i do really like the 1917

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,000
notebook that someone called out

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:57,280
a little expensive but it's gorgeous

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:59,200
any other questions let's see

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,640
how is john better than google drive app

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,640
native scan function

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,000
honestly i'm not sure that might be

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,359
better um

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
i think it just came out um at a time

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,520
where

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,599
it was not better um so if that works

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,280
for you i think that's great

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,520
i'd like to take a look at that because

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,760
it's been a minute um i didn't

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,839
i didn't love this the skew i think at

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,640
the time but it's certainly been a

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,920
minute

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,920
um let's see

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,200
dry erase markers on mirrors is great um

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,640
i also have seen people

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,119
uh use them in offices full of glass

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,640
laminating a template or a drop grid uh

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:53,839
using dry erase markers in the fridge

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:53,839
all some great comments in the chat

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,559
i just wanted this thing i really liked

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,680
uh seeing in the chat is um

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,880
that uh drawing on paper can help

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,160
with object permanence as well so that

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,400
does make a lot of sense that that can

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,240
be easier for someone and so having

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,240
that flexibility in their their tools

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,240
versus digital drawing i think is a good

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
consideration

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,319
um i did draw as a kid but actually not

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,720
a lot a lot of my friends in my graphics

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,319
uh

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,559
programs actually were way more

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,760
illustrators um i was more like a

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,359
colorer

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,400
is that a thing i really liked redrawing

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,160
pokemon

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,760
that was a big task apparently

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,280
thank you everyone for sharing all of

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,480
these tools i know there's a lot of

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,160
tools

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,800
um usability testing remotely

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,839
of a lot of things uh i would say a lot

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,040
of what we like to do

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,920
is really just like a moderated

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,880
hangout where we can keep it as crappy

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,480
as we need to

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,000
we can use tree tests and those sorts of

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,359
things that are

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,079
just showing off a sketch in a figma

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,960
preview

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,440
you know figma does give a really good

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,839
sort of

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,880
share link and interactive prototyping

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,640
options so

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
that's great um we've definitely been

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,520
playing around

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,359
with different uh video tools and

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,640
recording tools and so i'm still trying

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,480
to nail down

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,400
what i would recommend for you i know

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,119
that go to meeting

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
um and envision was it was a pretty

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,960
successful

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,359
combination with us for a while as well

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,960
there's a lot of other tools

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:50,240
i would also even just say i think

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,440
that otter io is a helpful one even

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,359
though it's not directly for for

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,839
usability testing but for transcripts

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:59,839
while

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:59,839
testing yeah

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,079
any other questions i might have missed

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,800
i think i have finally

00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,480
oh how would you use uh sketching in a

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,800
real-time remote communication okay if

00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,559
there are any other questions that i

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
haven't answered please repost them

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,480
because i missed it

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,520
um yeah so as far as um sketching real

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,559
time remotely

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,960
um that is great i mean i do that a lot

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,119
um so one of the things i like about the

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,440
remarkable is that the

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,319
notebooks think pretty quickly so i can

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,760
screen share

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,480
my remarkable app and then pop out of

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,559
the notebook

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,160
while i'm working on it and then share

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,119
that screen or

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,000
drop a screenshot into a slack i do that

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,079
a lot

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,240
i make something very ugly and i drop it

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,880
into the slack as a screenshot um so i

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,640
think

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,800
that can work i know it's a little

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,480
asynchronous but even just being on a

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,000
call with somebody and they're walking

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,920
through something

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,280
being able to very quickly snap a

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,359
picture on your phone

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,119
or have something that uploads digitally

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,319
and then slack them and say is this what

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,559
you're talking about

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,680
and be able to you know keep it as real

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,359
time as possible

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,079
is great a lot of times after these big

00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,839
um product planning calls i'll try to

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,599
clean up my notes and share them out

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,440
immediately after just to say you know

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,839
are we all leaving on the same page

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,599
so i think it's it's really about just

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,200
using the real-time remote communication

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,200
tools that you already use

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,680
more

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,280
yes sometimes i just sketch something in

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,280
a notebook take a photo with my phone

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,520
and upload it into slack i do this a lot

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,880
um i i have held things up to a camera

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,000
during a zoom meeting but

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,640
i find that um everybody's mileage

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,880
varies

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,720
and they might see a lot of pixels or

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,319
they might see like one inch off from my

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,920
notebook and not see any of the sketch

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,240
that i'm trying to hold up so i've given

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,079
up doing that personally

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,440
the ipvocam does really help for that

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,440
but i know that not everybody has that

00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,520
opportunity any other

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,520
questions

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,960
all right thank you so much for for

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,480
attending and uh hope you have a great

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:28,319
rest of your

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,319
