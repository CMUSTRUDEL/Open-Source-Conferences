hopefully um we won't have uh

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
too many people miss out on the start um

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
so really thank you very much for

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,080
joining me today

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,840
my name is will huggins um i've been

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,240
involved with the jew pupil community

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,440
for about 10 years now

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,400
i founded a drupal agency called zucha

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,279
um mainly in the uk but we also work

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
throughout spain

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,320
and the us and brazil um so

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,039
um we are very much involved with

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,200
contributing to the drupal community and

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
one of the things that i wanted to

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
do as part of drupalcon global was to

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
talk about project discovery

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
because it's something that we've

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,600
already learned a lot about particularly

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
over the last few years working with

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,239
lots of different types of clients

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,320
and and also analyzing when projects

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
don't really go right

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,160
so yeah today we're going to talk about

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
discovery and why getting discovery

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,480
right can build the foundation

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,719
for successful projects

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
we're going to start with a a kind of

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,159
trip back in time to look at

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,840
a lesson from history when not

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,880
thinking about discovery was a real

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
costly mistake for one brand

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
we're also going to then look at the

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
role of discovery so what does what does

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
discovery mean

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
and we're going to look at it also in

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,640
the context of how

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,240
agile has evolved and what does that

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
mean for discovery

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,680
i want to kind of talk through some

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,799
tools as well for

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,040
um using when we're uh

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,799
when we're undertaking discovery um and

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
trying to use those tools to

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
to make sure that we really understand

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
what uh what we're doing before we go

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
into

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,439
the later phases of projects and then

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
i'm going to finish with another example

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
of when in contrast to the first trip

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
back in time

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,159
when actually a successful discovery

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,840
phase

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,280
underpinned a successful project

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,600
delivery so

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,880
our kind of presentation really starts

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,520
with this trip back in time to

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,320
1996 and we are in

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,920
oakbrook illinois at the mcdonald's

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
headquarters

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
and it's been another really bad board

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
meeting

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,520
no one's really happy with the

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,640
performance and in particular

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
market share has been falling and both

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
burger king and wendy's share

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,319
has been rising burger king is perceived

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
by the board to have stronger

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,640
quality values wendy's perceived to have

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
a more sophisticated menu

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
and the ceo remarks to the board that

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
even his son's family have stopped

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
eating at mcdonald's

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,200
so with those perceived competitive

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
strengths and anecdotal feedback

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
the board move into action the

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
mcdonald's corporate machine to find a

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
solution

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
for for their problem and the solution

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
they come up with is

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
is the arch deluxe people who are as old

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
as i am can probably remember

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,840
what that looks and tastes like but it's

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,200
basically a more gourmet style burger

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,319
with dijon mayonnaise fresh tomato

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,560
and and it was i ideally kind of placed

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,080
in the minds of the uh mcdonald's

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
executives

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,440
to take on the the flame grilled whopper

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,560
and and the kind of more extensive menu

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,120
that uh that wendy's offered

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
um they didn't go half-assed at this

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
they they decided to take this one

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,760
on head-on um and so they stuck behind

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,879
it a hundred million dollar

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
record-breaking uh advertising budget

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,000
so really no product launch had ever

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,480
seen this kind of

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
expenditure before um but you know they

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,280
they thought this was going to turn

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
around their market share problems

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,879
and deliver them an extra billion

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,640
dollars of revenue a year

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,040
so kind of 100 million felt right um

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
but then 100 million turned into 150

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,360
million

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,159
and uh things were still not quite

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
working and

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
to put it in the the slightly uh

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
sanitized words of the

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,080
of the board at the time uh the

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,400
archdeluxe failed to meet expectations

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
and basically within a year they started

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
to roll back the product

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
and within four years it had completely

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,720
disappeared from menus

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,040
around the globe and

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,479
to kind of underpin the failing it's

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
really interesting to see some of the

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,840
quotes

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
from the executives at the time so

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,919
different board members had different

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
views

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,400
uh the executive chef who developed the

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
product maybe predictably blamed it on

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
price and said it was too expensive

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
one of the board directors said it was

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
too different for the the mcdonald's

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,919
audience to accept

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
another board director said it was not

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
different enough

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
and actually they should have been more

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
radical and so

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
not only did this highlight the fact

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,199
they didn't know why their solution had

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
failed

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
it shows they didn't even understand the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,360
problem they were trying to solve

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
they've kind of taken this huge budget

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
and this

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
energy of fixing their problem uh

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
straight to the

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
solution phase um and i'm sure they did

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
loads of research with people

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
but by that point their research was all

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,919
about the solution they hadn't really

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,440
thought about the problem

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,280
so what does this mean for discovery

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
well discovery

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,560
really is all about the problem um and

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
in the words of

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
of uh one of the 20th century's great

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,479
thinkers

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
um uh einstein said you know given an

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,600
hour to solve a problem

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
he'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
problem

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
and five minutes thinking about the

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,919
solution

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,400
discovery is all about the problem uh

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,600
it's that's where we live with discovery

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,720
we live in the problem

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
and really we kind of we're not

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
interested in solutions we want to

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
understand

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
what uh is wrong or what needs to be

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
done and why

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
and then we can start thinking about the

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,479
how and the what

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,400
of the solution so to put it another way

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,400
the role of discovery is to ask that

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,759
question is to ask why

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,319
to understand what we're doing um

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
really requires you to ask why and that

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
gives you the platform then

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
to decide how you want to do it and what

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,759
the solution will be

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,000
if you don't do that you then start

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,199
creating this kind of self-fulfilling

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
um loop of of justifying what

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,440
the solution is going to be and why

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,440
you've picked it

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
the the context of discovery i think is

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,319
really interesting in the evolution of

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
agile because

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
um i think a lot of people assume and i

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
certainly do used to

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
that if you're using agile how the

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
discovery's part and parcel of agile

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,919
you know we all know the playbook and so

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,919
if i'm doing agile i'm doing discovery

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
and everything will be good but actually

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,479
there's a lot of myths to that

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
um and the history of agile has

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,960
developed in such a way i think that you

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
know kind of even

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,960
back before mcdonald's launched their

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,160
uh archdeluxe uh we we kind of started

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
to see things like scrum

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,199
emerge and then they were followed by

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,240
extreme programming feature driven

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,199
development

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
um culminating really in 2001 with the

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
agile manifesto

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
you know promoting individuals above

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,599
process

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
um making things work ahead of

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,919
documentation

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
etc and and kind of you know all the way

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,599
through to

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
um not too many years ago when eric

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,280
reese

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
wrote the lean startup again a real

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,880
bible for a lot of people

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
like me who who are passionate about

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
agile

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
but really a lot of these things evolve

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,199
to think about the how

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,720
and the what um they still weren't a lot

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,440
of things to think about the

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
why um even the tools so there's some

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
such great tools around for delivering

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
agile projects

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
um many of these i'm sure you're

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,680
familiar with there's many more

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
um that are really excellent ways but

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
again

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
they very much focus around the how and

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
the what

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
there aren't that many tools and

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
structures that really help us to figure

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,919
out the why

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,400
again a lot of you will probably uh

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
be familiar with this double diamond um

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
approach

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,639
and and again you know this for me you

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
know really clearly

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,759
summarizes the process um

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
and for me what it's about is is you

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,440
know the first half of a project

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
really is all about the problem it's all

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,479
about the whys to discover and define

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,400
the problem

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,800
um but a lot of i think a lot of people

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
interpret this differently and i'd be

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
very surprised i mean you know we don't

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
have to go to the extreme of einstein

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
and go 55 minutes to five minutes in

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
terms of ratio

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
but i'd be very surprised how many uh

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
projects

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,279
have the resources and time apportioned

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,120
50 percent

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,120
between discovery and delivery

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,160
and the la that lack of structure and

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
that kind of confusion

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,320
that i think has been generated in in

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,360
the agile

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,200
evolution of agile methodologies um has

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
created the risk of getting discovery

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,360
wrong so not not not doing it

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
we we kind of know and we get told in

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
the methodologies that we need to do it

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,839
as part of

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
uh you know the sprint planning and

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
defining user stories

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
but there is a real risk that we get it

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
wrong

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,279
confirmation bias discovery is one of

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
the the reasons that crops up

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
many many times so this is where you

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,240
kind of think you know

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
what the answer is and what the solution

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,920
should be and so all of your death

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
testing and all of your discovery

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,279
is really just around justifying a

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,080
decision you've already made

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,680
at the start of the project partial team

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
discovery is one of the most common

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
and again i'll talk about this a little

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
bit later on

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,640
in the one of the biggest things about

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,279
discovery is involving

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,040
a a team that incorporates all of an

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,240
organization all of the stakeholders and

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
all of the users

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,519
um they're going to be affected so that

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,920
you have a

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,560
much more holistic view of where the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,279
problems lie and what solutions

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
you need to find in order to solve those

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,480
problems

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,120
outsource discovery is a really big one

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
i think for organizations

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
where they kind of think you know they

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
can pay a consultant or an agency

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
or a specialist to come in tell them

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
what to do and then they can go away and

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
do it

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
well actually again that kind of is

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,120
looking at it the wrong way around is

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
you know the problems

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,440
are their problems and it needs some

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
self-reflection

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,920
as part of that kind of bigger discovery

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
team to be able to identify them

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
and the other one which i'll talk about

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,959
a little bit more towards the end is is

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,279
this notion of a big bang discovery

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
so like you know at the end of discovery

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,720
that's it my work's done now we can send

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
the researchers home

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,880
the business analysts can kind of focus

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,000
on uh articulating user stories and

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,680
requirements

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,279
but actually there's a completely wrong

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
way to look at it discovery is happening

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,240
all the time

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
we're learning all the time people are

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,800
changing all the time

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,519
so really trying to embed a notion that

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,399
um discovery runs throughout the process

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,760
it is a really important part of

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,320
of how to make discovery work

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
and again you know it all makes sense

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,880
people

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,720
um great thinkers uh have said it

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,640
and and this one characteristically in

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
few words if you define the problem

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
correctly you

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,240
almost have the solution so you know in

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,640
other words get discovery right

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,279
and you'll have the foundation to

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,800
deliver

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,320
successful solutions so kind of some of

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,040
the tools i wanted to talk through so

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,040
these are the things that

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,360
we use regularly i use regularly to

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
try to make sure that we're getting

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
discovery right we're asking the right

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,519
questions and we're building

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
a platform to go on and deliver the

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,800
right solutions

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,200
so the first one is is that one about

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
the team so assembling the right team

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
and nurturing this cross

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
cross-functional collaboration is such

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
an important part

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,440
of of agile but it's really an important

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
part of discovery

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,720
um and again i think um the partial team

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,680
discovery

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
problem crops up so many times where

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
maybe the developers get involved too

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
late they don't really understand the

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
context

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
of the problem that they're trying to

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,839
solve or

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,079
researchers leave the project after

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,399
discovery

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,320
and kind of hand off to someone else it

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,680
just doesn't work you know you need this

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,240
really collaborative one-team approach

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,120
to make sure that discovery builds that

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,519
foundation of insight and understanding

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,200
on which you can build good solutions

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
and deliver successful projects

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
communication um really this is this is

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
the

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
you know this is the one you've got to

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,880
listen to end users

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
you've got to listen to stakeholders

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
the team members within the team you

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
know a lot of the insights from

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,959
discovery will come from

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
the team members that are working

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,120
through

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
whether they're focused on user research

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
whether they're focused on internal

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
stakeholder management

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
they will be the ones that are driving

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,399
these insights and

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,160
and making sure that you're listening to

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
them throughout the team

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
uh throughout that process is really

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,839
important

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,279
just a quick diversion um i see

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,320
someone's asked about the link to the

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,000
slides i will

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
share that with you with you all before

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
you go i think at the moment it's just

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
on a private google slides

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
but i will make it public and share that

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
at the end

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,399
final tip on the communication work

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
really hard

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,399
to reach marginalized groups this

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
is really important for lots of reasons

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,240
one because they're voices that aren't

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
often heard but also

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
the more you listen to the voices of

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
marginalized groups the more you hear

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
issues and problems that maybe go

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,440
unnoticed

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,279
or are buried or hidden from view by

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,959
doing more broad sweeping

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,199
uh research or or insight gathering

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,160
and actually i find some of the most

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,760
useful insights

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,279
not just for communicating with and

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
delivering solutions for marginalized

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,360
groups but for

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
all of the audiences that you're

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
communicating with come from those

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,839
groups

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,920
because they are acutely aware

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,519
of of solutions that fail for them they

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
really help you to understand how

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,920
solutions can be delivered to uh to to

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,240
be successful for

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,480
everybody that's uh that's accessing

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,480
them

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
impact mapping so some of these will be

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
um either

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,800
uh examples of methodologies that you're

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
familiar with or you use or variations

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
there's lots of different flavors of

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,399
these of these tools um

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and and i think the key is to to really

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
experiment and make sure that you kind

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
of pick in the flavor that works best

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,519
for you

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
um i like impact mapping because it

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,519
keeps the problem

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,000
at the center so it's like what you know

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,240
what are we trying to do here why are we

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,199
are we trying to build a solution

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
um it then puts the user next so it's

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,199
kind of it's out

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
orientated but it's also user centered

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,399
and what's really good about it when you

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,880
kind of map the problem

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,560
who you're trying to fix the problem for

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
what the impact of solving that problem

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
is

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
and what the potential solution is for

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,639
all of the different users

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
all of the different problems and all

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
the different impacts and

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,760
solutions you start to highlight

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,480
assumptions

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
and you start to highlight where your

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
assumptions are built on

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,040
weak or on strong insights and it really

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,399
helps to guide that

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,760
that ongoing discovery piece it's also a

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,880
really quick way

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,240
of helping to kind of map where you want

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
to focus

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,519
the resources that you have within the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,279
project

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
user story mapping this is really a user

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,720
journey mapping this is really

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
commonly used in agile and again

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639
what's great about it is user-centric it

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
really encourages collaboration and it

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,160
demands research

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
you can't do user journey mapping

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
without talking to the users

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,519
that are undertaking those journeys or

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,800
trying to achieve those

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,399
objectives or reach those goals it also

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
has a really visual output

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
user journey mapping is a great way of

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,639
communicating to stakeholders

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
about what the insights from users have

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
told you

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,279
and why you're developing designing and

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,959
working on the solutions that you are um

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,199
user story mapping so this is kind of

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,759
the next level down

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,040
so individually user story level making

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
sure that everything's

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,680
again outcome orientated so what problem

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,480
am i trying to solve

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,639
user-centered prioritization so thinking

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
not just in terms of

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,240
the the hierarchy of opportunity but

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,519
then hierarchy

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,279
the uh the problems by users

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,720
focusing on end-to-end journeys so again

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,079
making sure that you're not looking at

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
problems in isolation

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,279
but understanding a more holistic view

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
of what

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,320
problems people face and what they're

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,759
trying to achieve with the services that

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
you're designing for them

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,560
and again you know the great thing about

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,079
user story mapping and why it's so

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
popular in agile it

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,399
is a really fast efficient way of

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,240
planning what it is you want to do

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,720
and and kind of moving into those

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,680
delivery stages

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,519
and then finally embedding these tools

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,480
and behaviors

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,319
as part of an ongoing process so rather

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
than having discovery

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
again one of the other words i hate

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,880
about that's sometimes used for

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,439
discovery is pre-work

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,039
like the real work happens later but you

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,799
know we'll just do some pre-work

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,400
you know it's completely the wrong way

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
of looking at it discovery is always

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,439
going on discovery is so important to

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,280
underpin

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,199
uh the insight and the information

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,600
needed for the delivery phase to be

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,840
successful

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,520
so just to kind of give you um an

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,640
example of making it happen

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
so this was a learning journey that we

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,039
that we

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
were on for for the last couple of years

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,640
really and the story starts going kind

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
of getting back into our time machine

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
and going

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,320
back to 2012 at this time

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,600
and the olympics is coming to london my

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,840
home city almost i live just outside

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,360
and you know hosting a mega event is

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
huge undertaking

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,679
and one of the big challenges for the

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
city

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,200
it was to mobilize volunteers to help

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,559
deliver

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,840
a really great olympics and and to do

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,080
that the city created

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,200
team london this kind of concept of

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,880
bringing together

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,360
people of all ages all

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
walks of life to come and volunteer

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,000
their time and to make

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,559
uh visit london so team london and the

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,080
london olympics a great success

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,600
and it was an incredible success um

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,480
it's uh you know as a

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
kind of uh way of delivering games but

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
also

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,120
as a mechanism for bringing people

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,320
together and so one of the legacies

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,200
that the the city wanted to take from

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
the olympics

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,559
was to continue that and to keep team

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,320
london going

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
so we constantly had this energy around

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,600
volunteering and making london a better

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,480
place

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,400
so fast forward to 2018 there's a

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,080
digital platform in place

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
to enable people to apply for

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,000
volunteering opportunities

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
to enable causes to post the

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
opportunities to enable them to

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,960
collaborate with volunteers

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
but the motivations were waning it was

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
slowing down

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,480
people weren't using it um and actually

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
you know it was starting to really go

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,880
stale

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
so we assembled a cross-functional team

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,760
so we brought everyone together

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,000
from across the city and the mayor's

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
office and everyone that was involved

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,080
with running team london as well as the

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
development team and the design team and

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
the researchers and we really built this

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,600
multi

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,240
uh disciplined collaborative team to try

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,679
and understand

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
what was the problem and what we quickly

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,960
realized was we knew the problem in 2012

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
the problem was we need to host an

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
olympics

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
what's the problem now that we're trying

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
to solve so we went back to the drawing

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
board

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,280
and we started talking to people talking

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
to users talking to charities talking to

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,960
good causes people that lived in the

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,799
city residents

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
really tried to speak to everybody that

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,159
we could um

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,360
and as a research task that can be quite

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
overwhelming

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,799
um but the insight was really surprising

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,039
and and it was transformative um and it

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,720
challenged all of our preconceived ideas

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,760
and it turned all of our assumptions on

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,679
their on their head i mean for example

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
um one of our assumptions was that a lot

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,480
of the expectations

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,840
um that people had around volunteering

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
and reasons why they volunteered was

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,480
linked to age

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,320
but actually it was completely nothing

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
to do with age it was all about

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
motivation

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
some people wanted to learn new skills

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,320
brush up on their

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,679
uh kind of cv and resume um

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
other people just wanted to give back to

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,799
a particular cause

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,559
so it really gave it a different

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,919
perspective when we were writing those

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
user stories and mapping

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
the user journeys all the way through

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,799
i'm thinking of volunteering

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
right the way through to turning up

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,159
somewhere physically on a day

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,600
and and volunteering somewhere um

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,440
so it's uh it's really interesting that

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,880
um again you know the approach we took

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,039
was all built around team

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
and it was all built around user

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
interactions

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
and ultimately delivered a really

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,240
successful um

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,960
drupal project um which is uh always the

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,600
good

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
the good thing at the end of it so um

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,880
what

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,159
i i'm gonna rush to a finish now and i

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
just wanted to finish with one more

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
quote

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
um this time from russell akov which is

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
successful problem solving

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
requires finding the right solution to

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
the right problem we fail more often

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,240
because we solve the wrong problem

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
not because we get the wrong solution to

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,679
the right problem and discovery we're

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
all about finding

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,120
what the problem is so that we can build

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,640
solutions that address the right

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,200
problems

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
so thank you everybody i will take

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
questions i mean

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,280
i've had someone who's uh interested in

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,159
coming up um so i'm gonna

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
add you to the

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,840
session um

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,960
i thought i had but maybe you've uh

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,000
gone offline but does anyone have any um

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,880
any questions um that you want to ask

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,080
as i said i will share uh the slides a

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
link to the slides

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,880
um straight after i'm really happy for

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,320
you to use them share them

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,440
uh however i really hope it was useful

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,799
um so tools for the mapping phases um

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
i have started to use i'll give you a

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
bit of a

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,919
quick evolution of them um so we used to

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
use trello a lot for that

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,840
um it was kind of the first it was the

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,000
first place we could find where we could

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
you know kind of drag and drop

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
cards and and have a really

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,640
collaborative process

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,960
around working on those mapping phases

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,960
myro now and i think i'm pronouncing it

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,840
right certainly how i pronounce it

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,840
myro or miro i'll type it in

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
chat and that's one that we've used um a

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,880
lot at the moment and

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,919
um we find it again really great for

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,360
collaborating

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,039
we've had some amazing sessions

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,520
particularly during lockdown

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
we've you know a lot of our clients and

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
partners

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,559
are government organizations and so you

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
know they they couldn't put stuff on

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,559
hold during

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,840
lockdown that they got busier so we

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,520
couldn't stop we couldn't stop

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,520
research and we couldn't stop uh

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,880
discovery processes and so we've been

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,600
working with people

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,640
obviously remotely and myro has been

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,000
really good

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,840
um for that um uh

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
some more about pitfalls i've come back

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,799
onto the tools i think it's an

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,640
interesting one and definitely i think

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,240
people you know add any tools to the

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,280
chat that you use because

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,919
um uh miro yeah thank you um

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,520
uh because it's uh definitely uh you

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,039
know i'd like to learn more about the

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,880
tools that we can use

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,640
um so more about the pitfalls of

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,799
outsource discovery yeah this one

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,080
i think is key and i'm saying this from

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,240
an agency so

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,120
you know i'm an agency that people

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,480
outsource

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,799
uh you know work to my teams um but um

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,840
the way that we work and the way that i

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
try to

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,320
um you know the culture i try to build

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,360
is is one that we become an extension of

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,919
the client's team

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,960
so we're not an outsourced function

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
we're almost like an

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,320
in-sourced uh resource you know we're

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,760
kind of

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,039
you know helping to to build skills

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,760
and capacity and capability um within

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,520
um you know within the the individual

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,799
clients teams

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,559
and that's really important you know we

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,840
want to share knowledge we want

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,840
um to create a culture where

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
everybody's learning from the process

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
and everybody's learning from the

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
insights

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,200
and so i think you know when you do it

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
that way

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,039
it can work really well i think the

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,200
pitfalls are when you kind of do

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
you know like clients i've seen do an

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
rfp

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,840
for a discovery phase and they expect

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,279
you know their involvement to be

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,600
i'll speak to you at the beginning to

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,799
brief you and we'll see you at the end

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,200
when you present back

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,320
your discovery findings uh it's kind of

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
how it's i kind of you know

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,080
i read those and i think how how on

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
earth do they think

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
that you know someone from outside the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
organization is going to come to it

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,600
and you know just drop on them these

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,039
insights from nowhere without having

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,440
proper collaboration

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,640
and a fluid dialogue with them along the

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,320
way so

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,279
um yeah that's kind of i'd say you know

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,159
outsourcing it completely bad um think

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,320
of it as more of

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,000
insourcing extra resources and extra

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,279
skills that's kind of how i like to look

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,520
at it

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,440
so question uh user journey storyboards

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,279
business model canvas survey tools card

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
sorting prototyping

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,200
user-centered design strategies do you

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,960
use any of these and do you find

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,720
any particularly powerful so i'll start

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
with user centered design for me it's

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,760
all about user-centered design

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
and discovery definitely um

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,600
is is what underpins user-centered

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,440
design you know it's it's not about

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
the assumptions of a design team or a

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,039
particular

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
stakeholder it's it's a collaborative

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
process

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
um that that gets to the bottom of what

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
the problems are and then gives the

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,320
design team something really powerful to

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,679
work on

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
that's centered around those human

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,640
problems um storyboards

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,440
um to an extent but again we tend to use

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,559
these

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
more towards the solutions end so once

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
we kind of

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,640
once we've mapped those user journeys we

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
maybe start to storyboard

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,120
a little bit around how we want those

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
interactions to work maybe

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
and again getting into things like

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,720
prototyping

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
um definitely kind of starts to happen

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
at that kind of read

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,159
you know once you've defined the problem

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,799
you sort of diverge again

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,720
as you test different solutions um card

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,000
sorting definitely used card sorting a

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
lot

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
and and you know anyone who thinks they

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,400
can uh

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,039
create an information architecture for

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,000
a website without uh doing any sort of

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,080
card sorting or collaborative

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,480
insight gathering from users is is

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
probably

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,360
deluding themselves so example

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,279
impacts you strive for so yeah so the

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,279
impact mapping it's a good question and

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,400
i did wonder whether i should put some

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
examples but i mean

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
the one that kind of struck me as the

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,520
obvious one is you know

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,799
problem we need to

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,840
move from drupalcon minneapolis big

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,200
physical event with stans and

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,080
sessions and auditoriums to a virtual

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,039
user well one of the users is uh

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
exhibitors

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,240
you know these are the guys that pay

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,919
money and and keep

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:37,520
uh drupal con and and drupal association

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:40,240
moving forward financially so you've got

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,840
problem switching to virtual user

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,080
advertiser

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
impact so the impact is you know i want

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,080
to make sure that my advertising revenue

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
is delivering a return on investment

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,399
so what you know what impact can we have

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,559
to solve that problem

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,919
um and then you know finally solution

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,600
you know the solution

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,360
as we've seen here you know exhibit hall

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,240
i don't know if any of you have

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
um kind of taken a stroll a virtual

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
stroll around

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,640
and had a look i think it's really i

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,360
think it's great and actually as

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,080
someone who um kind of struggles i think

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
to

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
dive into the exhibit halls at

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,320
drupalcon's the physical drupal cons

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,679
i found the the exhibit hall for

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
drupalcon global actually quite

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
refreshing

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
um and i probably engaged more with

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,520
sponsors at this drupalcon i think than

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
i have

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,640
any other drupalcon um so kind of

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,840
a bit diverse but um i hope that

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,760
um makes sense so examples of continuous

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
discovery and how it practically works i

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
mean

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,760
this it's a really good question and

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,640
there's a couple of ways

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,080
is what we call dual track and so kind

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
of a little bit like the

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,360
the diagram that i showed on the slide

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,080
where you've got the continuous

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
discovery then

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,120
that kind of flows down into the

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,279
continuous delivery

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,159
um and that can work really well and you

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,320
can have uh

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,159
dedicated discovery sprints that operate

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,240
in parallel throughout

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,440
the agile process and that can work

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,679
really well

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,799
the other way is to incorporate this is

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
the way i prefer

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,559
is to incorporate it as part of the

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,760
backlog management

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,960
so when you're working through the

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,559
backlog and prioritizing is to really go

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,000
through all of the discovery learnings

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,159
and think about not just am i

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,159
prioritizing the right stories

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,919
am i building the right things at this

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,159
stage and in this sprint

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,679
but also has my learning changed are

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,480
these stories still right

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,200
is there anything we've learned from uh

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,000
testing

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,679
or uh stakeholder engagement or

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
collaboration that's kind of making us

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,679
question this and tweak it so

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,240
for me it's making that continuous

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,279
discovery be part of the overall kind of

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,440
backlog management that's kind of how i

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,520
like to do it

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,039
the biggest challenges for discovery

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,039
efforts in quarantine

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,600
is is really about getting

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,320
uh engagement with with the right people

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
um

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,080
so recruiting uh research candidates is

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,039
difficult

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,159
at the best of time but obviously when

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,799
you throw into the mix

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
people are working from home many of

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,440
them for the very first

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,880
time or if they uh

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,159
if they don't work their lives have been

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,799
thrown into turmoil because

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,799
husbands or wives are now at home or

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,640
children are not at school so

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,159
uh really trying to be sympathetic to

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
people um

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,279
and still get them to to give them your

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,880
time

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,279
whether they're an end user or a

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,240
stakeholder working in an organization

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,279
or an external stakeholder really trying

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,200
to get them to engage

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,240
has been has been a real challenge if

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
i'm honest it's been a great learning

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
but it's been that's probably been the

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,320
biggest challenge

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,279
so another question

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,159
pre-work um not being a good approach um

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,799
yeah so

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,159
uh for me and another one that i don't

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,080
like is sprint zero

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
i've sometimes heard discovery called

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,519
sprint zero

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
um and it kind of it almost demeans it

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,519
it makes it sound like it's something

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,960
that

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,799
um is uh you know

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,240
uh just kind of something you gotta do

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,080
it's almost like the admin bit before

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,240
you get the real work started

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,440
um and for me it's just you know i don't

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,360
like that tone

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,720
i think the better the better way of

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,760
looking at discovery is

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,200
is this is this platform of insight um

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,640
that helps you to understand the problem

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,919
you're going to solve before you even

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,480
start worrying about how you're going to

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,840
do it

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,000
or what the solution is going to look

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,880
like you kind of you're starting from

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,880
this base

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,559
this base point that gives you a really

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
good understanding of what it is you're

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,399
trying to solve

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,240
is it different from prototyping um i

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,720
mean you know prototyping

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,600
has a role in discovery um again i

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,919
always

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,000
would advise against not rushing into

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,440
prototyping too quickly

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,679
for the worry of that that thing i

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,760
mentioned earlier which is the

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,880
confirmation bias discovery it's the

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,240
kind of i know

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,159
i know what my solution is going to look

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,200
like i just need to prove to people that

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
it's right by

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,480
testing it and getting people to say

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
that it's right and so

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,679
you know diving into prototyping too

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,559
soon can be

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,640
problematic but there is no doubt that

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,399
prototyping has a role to play

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
sometimes when you're engaging with

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,320
users bringing things to

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,080
life for them in a prototype

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
particularly for a service

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
or a problem that they maybe don't have

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,600
a solution to yet

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
so there's no other point of reference

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,240
to help them

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,840
um absolutely you know kind of you know

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,440
prototyping can be um a really good way

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
of bringing things to life and helping

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,760
people to visualize

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
um and articulate the problems that

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,240
they're facing

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
the clicking noise i think it was me

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,919
tapping on the desk i'm afraid

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,039
so i really apologize if it stopped now

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,080
it was definitely me

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,600
tapping on the desk so

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,600
i think i've answered any more questions

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,320
