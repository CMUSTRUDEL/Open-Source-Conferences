00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
for ways to stay connected and really

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,599

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
really understand the rapidly evolving

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039

dialing in for this very first triple

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,039
con global event

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,840
i am grace and i have had the honor and

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,840
pleasure

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
of having worked in developer relations

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,039
for well over 16 years

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
across a number of really large and

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
small companies from

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,199
enterprise to fintech to small business

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,040
as well as gaming

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
now last fall i had the honor and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
pleasure of being invited

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
to be considered to be part of the

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,280
drupal association board

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,200
and for me that was just such a

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
highlight of last year because

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,280
i had it almost been a decade since the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,640
first time i had actually worked with

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,880
the drupal community

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
and i had actually helped with the very

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
first corporate sponsorship through

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
microsoft

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
with the drupal association at that time

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
i don't think i really

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
really knew what a big deal that was

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,240
until i joined to the board and jacob

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
reading was telling me what a big deal

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
it was

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,320
so it was really nice to hear that you

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
know all things come in a circle and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
that

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
i can now participate again in this

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
capacity so it's been really great to be

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
part of the board

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
and i still had my account but i was

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
locked out because it was

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
still associated with my microsoft email

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,880
account so thank you tim for helping me

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,960
recover

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,479
my old granola account so i can be

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
crunchy once again in the drupal

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,159
community many thanks

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
now it goes without saying that we are

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
living in

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,239
really extremely difficult times

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and for me i've been thinking a lot

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
about this book i read actually many

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,319
many years ago

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
love in the time of cholera which is how

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,080
i

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
was inspired for the title of my talk uh

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
my favorite author wrote this book

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
gabriel garcia marquez

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,879
and the other book that i've read from

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
that was 100 years of solitude highly

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,239
recommend both

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
and this particular book is really about

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,440
this romance between men and women

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,680
they meet in their late teens early 20s

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,120
and in the span of 50 years

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,400
they're separated by space time and

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,440
marriage

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
more multiple cholera outbreaks

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
and actually you may not know this

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
cholera was a pandemic itself

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,480
and it had seven incidences in the stand

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
of 150 years

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
now in this particular story in this

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,440
romance this couple was separated

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
for 50 years and they reunited finally

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,159
towards the end

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
and this book deals with some really

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,959
difficult topics about death

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
and aging death of romance death of

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,959
relationship

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,760
death in general and you know just

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
facing the

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,800
hardships of what life is really about

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
especially

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,959
in the middle of war and a pandemic like

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
cholera and also dressing issues of

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,720
isolation

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
mortality so i recommend this book it's

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
very

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
timely actually given what we're living

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
through right now

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
i think about this a lot i also think

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
about this

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,480
the twilight zone every time almost

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,920
every time i wake up i think am i still

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,239
in that twilight episode am i am i

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,519
and so clearly the washington post folks

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,360
felt the same

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
and someone wrote this article about

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
seven twilight zone episodes are so

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
appropriate for this time period of ours

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
right now

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,959
um and eerily enough

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,760
the pilot episode the very very first

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,959
episode

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,400
is entitled where is everybody if you

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,480
watch this episode i encourage you to

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
watch this this is available i think on

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,879
netflix and you watch our first episode

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
the guy wakes up

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,280
he's in an air force pilot's uniform he

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
doesn't know who he is he doesn't know

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
where he is

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,519
and he's walking around this town that

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,840
has signs of life

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
everywhere he goes but he can't find a

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,759
single

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
human being so he's walking around he

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,400
sees

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,919
like there's a hot pot of coffee the

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,360
stove is hot and he's

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,759
going from place to place and seeing

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
these real signs that people

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
must have been there but they're not

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
there for him

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,400
they're all gone for some reason he has

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
this weird feeling that he's being

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
watched the whole time

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
and at some point uh as his fear

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
escalates right this isolation can be

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,520
really scary

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
he says to himself it's time to wake up

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
now it's time to go now it's time to

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
wake up now

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,639
i thought i feel that every day do you i

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
feel like saying to myself it's time to

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
wake up it's time to wake up

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
and this fear gets even worse he runs

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
out to the town square and he says

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,880
where is everybody and when i walk out

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
the door sometimes i feel like that in

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,720
some of these desolate streets

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,639
where is everybody that's a question i

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,840
often ask myself too

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,199
big enemy in this story is isolation

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
which i know some of you

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
are facing right now and thinking about

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
on a daily basis and it is hard

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
and this is something that we have to

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,039
deal with on personal basis and work

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
basis

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,479
it's a tough time for all of us and the

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
internet

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,880
is changing well this sorry pandemic is

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
changing

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
everything in the way that we internet

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
particularly

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,960
many of us obviously are trying to

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,520
maintain those social

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
connections so things like facebook has

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
skyrocketed

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
and i'm i don't know about you guys if

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
you are on facebook i see

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
people cropping back up on facebook that

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,960
have been there for years

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
as they're seeking that social

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
connection that they usually maintain

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
in person it's really difficult to do

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,840
that during this pandemic

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
and equally so we're seeing a remarkable

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
number of people

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
going to entertainment sites so on one

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
hand we want to connect

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,680
on the one hand we want to forget so

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
these sites are growing up significantly

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
not too surprisingly mobile app usage

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
has gone down

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,000
because we're really not very mobile

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,919
right now

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
also not terribly surprising i don't

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
know about you guys but when

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,319
we started shelter in place here i think

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
i was probably checking the news every

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
five to ten minutes

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
trying to figure out you know what's

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,560
going on where the virus is

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,840
where is everybody what's going on right

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
so i was checking the news quite a bit

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,479
and clearly a lot of other people are

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
checking

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
news outlets quite frequently just to

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
understand what what am i missing where

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
is everybody

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
and i will tell you where everybody is

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
they're here

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,880
on zoom right in this muppet land and

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,199
zoom we're all living right now

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,319
and you know while we're connecting

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
we're not really

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
connecting the way that we're used to

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
because this is really the way we want

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
to connect with people

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
it's interesting so there's obviously

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
huge uptick in zoom usage

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,639
huge uptick in other platforms like

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,639
google duo

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
and house party things that some of us

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,360
have never heard of

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
huge spike in that but this

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,599
is a little bit more of what some of us

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
want this interpersonal connection

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,800
but even this this one-on-one with

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
kermie

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
isn't quite you know hitting that zone

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,599
of like really connecting because as you

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
can see

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,520
kearney's eyes are floating off to a

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,360
different part of the screen so

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,039
you're not making that eye connection

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
and then you think you're looking at him

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,720
but he thinks you're not looking at him

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
so you're not making that real human

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
connection that you need

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
so badly as you're talking to someone

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,759
very challenging

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,319
and as we are all all of us

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,840
taxing our home internet situations

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
to an extreme that none of these

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
internet service providers have ever

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,199
planned for we're hooked up being our

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
way through internet space

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
and often leaving our zoom or other

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
platform

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,440
experiences frozen in time like this

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,440
because our internet gave up on us in

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,039
the middle of a meeting and we often

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
leave these meetings with an expression

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,120
just like this han solo being frozen in

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
carbonite

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
this is often what i look like when my

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
internet hiccups on me

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
and you know hopefully it's not when i'm

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
having a meeting with my boss

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,240
or my peers because this is not the

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,800
expression i want to leave with them for

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,000
the rest of the day

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,719
now all of that oh my god is this just

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
really

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
exhausting when you're sitting and

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
looking at a screen

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
all day long trying to make that human

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,760
connection that's so hard to do

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,080
in this virtual format so i i often

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
go out for walks and i spend a lot of

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
time

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
contemplating meaning of life how we're

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
gonna connect

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
in this time period with this pandemic

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,200
and

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,440
you know really how do we you know

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
belong in our communities when we can't

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
be face to face like we're doing right

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,640
now we're doing a virtual conference

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
how do we really have those meaningful

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,120
connections

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,120
and that meaningful impact together

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
of course then you get home your furry

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
friends that you've been taking on

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,399
multiple completed walks a day

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
are absolutely exhausted exhausted

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,240
and really they're reflecting the pure

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
exhaustion we're all

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
feeling in trying to live this

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,200
experience this way

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,080
this is such a shift in the way that we

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
are working

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
from day to day today where many of us

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
are literally sitting

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,000
in front of a screen having our meetings

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,680
all day long

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
whereas in person you're hopping from at

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,839
least room to room yet

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
at least a few minutes of walking time

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,680
between meeting room

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
if nothing else but in this situation

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,640
many of us are just sitting

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,800
literally just connecting from meeting

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,600
to meetings it is really

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
really tiring

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,560
now the most the

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,440
massive open online courses the moocs

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
at some point last year having some

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,880
serious decline

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
in academic circles they just didn't see

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,279
that this kind of concept was gonna

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,760
survive

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,360
well they are the comeback kids of the

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,560
pandemic and they're seeing

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
seven times the traffic that they were

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
seeing

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,839
during this pandemic right now so

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,160
they're having a huge lift as many of us

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
are really seeking meaning through

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
learning

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
right and we're seeking meaning by

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
learning new programming languages

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,720
new disciplines like data science and

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,560
interestingly enough the breakout hit of

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,839
the pandemic season is

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
the science of well-being because we're

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,519
all struggling to keep our ceremony

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,399
during this time period right so

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,680
we're looking for education around how

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
we're going to stay sane

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,320
as we're sheltered in place and we can't

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
see eye to eye we can't be in person

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,160
and all these things and so these

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
mooc sites are really enjoying a level

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
of traffic and engagement

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
that they've never seen before and thank

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
goodness that they're there and they

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,240
offer

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,160
an outlet for people who really want to

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
learn and really engage in this way

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
now evans data put out this forecast

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,760
last year where we're

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,959
ending 2019 with almost 24 million

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,079
global

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,600
developers in the world was india

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,160
outpacing us in 2024. so

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
that's a massive number of developers

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,399
but if you

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
sort of calculate all the people that

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,279
are shifting careers right now

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,160
where our kind of work is so

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,320
accommodating

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
to working anywhere in the world working

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
from your home your kitchen wherever you

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
might be

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
and as people are shifting because they

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,920
have to their whatever work they were

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
doing before

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
was not accommodating to this new world

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,120
that we're operating in with this

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
pandemic

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,279
i expect that we'll be seeing more

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,639
developers joining forces with us

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,639
as as time goes on

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
massive massive shifts obviously to the

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
conference experience

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
even the biggest developer conferences

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
in the world

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,720
microsoft apple um

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,720
and google either cancelled or postponed

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
or virtualized their their conference

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
that's a big big shift for these massive

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,839
massive conferences

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
and now i show you my favorite picture

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
of fish why am i showing you a picture

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
of fish

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,680
well i show this picture to my teams a

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
lot in devrel at mongodb

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
and this is really about the message

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,480
around the fact that

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,240
you can't meet 24 million developers

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
globally in person

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
so you always have to have a strategy

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
around scaling

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,279
to the masses of developers that are

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
online globally so it's really

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
always about thinking about how we scale

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,760
all the things we do in person to

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,040
that online format through programs

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
through community

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
through content and so we were already

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
doing those sorts of things

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
such as making sure there it's really

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,440
great engaging content

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
on our developer hub on

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,920
developer.mongodb.com

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,680
so here we engage with them in written

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,600
content sample code

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,839
tutorials our twitch streams

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
and you know the message to the team has

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
always been about scaling county scaling

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
we have forums on that dev hub

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,399
and you know just always think about how

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
we get to global developers not just how

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,240
we get to them in person

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,720
now i will be honest though we miss this

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
we miss being on a plane getting to that

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,279
next destination

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,440
to go speak in person at a conference

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,680
this you do we really love this

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,079
experience

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,760
nothing nothing replaces the experience

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,639
of being on stage

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,079
doing a presentation seeing the crowd

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
and feeling the energy

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
in the community and engaging with you

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,160
this way

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
it's so hard to replicate this an online

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
format

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,120
this is one of our favorite things to do

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
and particularly afterwards the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,199
one-on-one questions that we get

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
as you're engaging with us on whatever

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,240
we spoke about you miss

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
this this is so hard

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
and the thing that i am often reminded

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
of many many years ago when i was in an

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,440
open source conference

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,760
it might have actually been a drupalcon

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,480
conference honestly i had done some kind

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,279
of talk

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,320
i was walking around in the hallways an

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,440
attendee came

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
up to me randomly and said so are you

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,720
relating yet

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,040
and i thought what oh

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
right he's asking me this question

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,399
because in my title is

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,079
the word relations developer relations

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,800
so i have been asking myself this

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,839
question quite a bit recently which is

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
are you relating yet how do we relate in

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
this

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,959
online format that we're in right now

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,880
and to be very honest with you there's

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,440
no magic bullet there's no silver bullet

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
to this

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,920
we're all learning as we go

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,920
because really truly how do we relate in

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,360
this muppet madness that we have to

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,040
operate in right now

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,240
how do we belong we're so far apart and

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,279
this is as close

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,120
as we're going to get

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,360
well some of us are seeking belonging

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,800
by really leaning into the things that

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,000
still matter to us

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,759
with our technical skills such as

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
saving the oceans and building

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
applications to help those

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,880
who are engaged and making sure that our

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
oceans

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,519
are protected for some

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,880
it's about creating net new solutions in

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,560
this battle against kobit 19.

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
great example of that there are

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,279
employees from

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
apple alphabet from amazon and for

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,560
mongodb

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
who joined forces in partnership with

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
boston children's hospital

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,959
and harvard medical school to build this

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,160
crowdsource application

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,600
so that folks can tell it tell the app

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,639
if they have uh coronavirus and so this

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
allows

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
uh researchers and medical officials to

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
really understand

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
where the trends of a coronavirus are

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,079
happening in the united

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,560
states and so this solution was based on

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,360
the work that these volunteer employees

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,240
did

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,000
and based on and put on mongodb atlas

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
which is our cloud product

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
and so this was done in literally a

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
week's time frame

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
because they actually repurposed the

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
same crowdsource

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
crowdsource solution that was used for

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,399
flu near you

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
very relatable type of solution it's

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
variable

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,000
transitions very quickly for the purpose

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,560
of covet 19.

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,360
and here in the drupal community the

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,079
drupal association has a high dependency

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
on in-person events right for

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,560
fundraising

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,039
and as cova 19 shut down our event our

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,919
event opportunities that left us with

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,839
a hole in the funds that the association

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,760
really needed to operate

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,880
and the drupal association is really at

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,919
the heart and core

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,079
of the drupal community and so we ran

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,199
this campaign around jupiter cares

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,319
we raised 500k

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,319
in just a little over 30 days with the

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,440
help of 150 businesses

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,919
and 2 000 individuals

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
right because drupal association is part

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,960
is the heart and core of the community

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
we have to keep that going because you

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,200
know what

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,360
we have people in the front lines of

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,160
coven 19 that depend

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,520
on drupal and need drupal as part of the

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
functioning of their business

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,960
and the work that they're doing in the

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
battle against copen19

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
so that work is meaningful so if you

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
haven't joined the drupal association

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
yet

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,039
i encourage you to do it the minimal

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,559
that you need to sign up for is

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,679
15 us dollars or 15 euros please sign up

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,880
it'll help the community out

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,440
now back to mongodb for a second we have

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
our

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
largest event uh in the beginning of

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
summer it's called mongodb world

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
and just like all the other conferences

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
we had to virtualize this really quickly

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
and so we reformatted it we called it

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
mongodb live

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
and this is of course hard for us as

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,000
well because this is the opportunity

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,640
where we

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,720
create nurture that sense of belonging

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
and togetherness right for our community

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
of mongodb

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,520
developers but we decided to lean

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,480
in full on to really reflect

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
the reality of however operating today

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,240
including

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
having our keynote speakers all in one

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,160
zoom-like picture

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
as part of the keynote because this is

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
the world that we're living and

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,320
operating in today

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,120
and as many of you know an experienced

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,160
day-to-day

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
many of us have pets we have partners we

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,520
have children

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,200
running in the background and so we

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,440
close the keynote with the help

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,960
of one of our keynote speakers children

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
and you can see you know the background

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,559
of his

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
one of his rooms and she's closing out

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,760
the keynote

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,200
and you know this is really about the

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
the reflection of

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
how we are living and operating today

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,640
that is hard

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,400
and not everything is polished

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,720
and the other thing we wanted to do is

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,960
to really use i'm going to be live

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
as a platform to educate about black

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,960
lives matters because

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
every single day there's social

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,360
injustice happening to black americans

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,799
from day to day today that we really

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,039
need to stop

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,919
now shifting gears a little bit i will

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,320
say

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,480
and i always love this some of the best

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,640
ideas come from the community

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
this devops conference is just about to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,720
be canceled right

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,440
and one of the participants sort of put

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
together this mock-up of a virtual booth

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,880
and his favorite gaming platform animal

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
crossings

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,200
and put this picture up on twitter and

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,960
said hey check out my booth

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,360
and someone else of course quickly

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
replied said we should do the conference

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,159
there

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,919
guess what they sure did and one of our

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,679
developer advocates adrian

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,600
participated in the single track

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,280
conference that actually reached

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,520
8 500 unique users on the platform

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
and what a great platform to use if you

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,120
think about it

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
gaming platforms are really really

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,559
extraordinarily great

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
and set up for scale and one of the best

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,600
platforms you can use

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
you're thinking about massive online

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
engagement skill

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
and to food at least as you saw in this

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
previous picture

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
she's wearing mongodb swag and then

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
created other swag to share with the

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,559
other attendees

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,400
so i'm not quite the same and you know

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,880
everyone came into the

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
theater as their avatar selves but she

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
was able to engage with them speak with

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
them

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,360
do her presentation and then give out

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,720
some swag

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,760
going back to han solo for a second here

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,039
i feel like this from time to time where

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,640
the feeling is that i'm frozen in time

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,600
waiting waiting waiting for things to go

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,200
back to normal does this resonate with

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,400
you guys

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,039
yeah and it's hard but

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
the reality is we're not getting back to

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,919
that normal

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
anytime soon we're getting to a new

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,120
normal

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
and you can see that reinforced with

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
news items like last week fujitsu

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,159
announcing

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,440
that they are planning for permanent

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,880
work from home plans

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,760
for 80 000 global employees for most of

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,159
them to be working from home permanently

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,840
so that's a big deal so yes

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,919
this is the experience that we're in

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,480
right now it's not optimal

00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,960
but we can be together or far apart

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,679
and i encourage you to really think

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,240
about

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,600
special skills that you have that you

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,520
can bring to bear

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,720
in this really difficult situation we're

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,039
all in

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
we can continue to make a difference

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,760
while we're apart we're intact we're so

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
fortunate to be able to work from home

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,400
and do the things that we do

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,400
in a remote capacities we are living in

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,559
a world full of chaos and hurt right now

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,240
so i encourage you to think about

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,039
leaning in and helping where you can

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,840
so whether it's in the ongoing battle

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,240
against kobe 19

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,320
or to help organizations in fighting

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,000
those social injustices that black

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,120
americans face day after day

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,360
after day here in the u.s

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
or really just continuing to contribute

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,960
to open innovation and rights and

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,960
communities of open source

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,080
so if you're done with just

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,000
learning and

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,000
yes you can keep binge watching but is

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,200
that still satisfying do you really just

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
want to binge watch all the time

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,799
this is good exercise please continue to

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,480
do this but maybe

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,280
you're done with just doing those kind

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,280
of plated walks

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
are you relating to this yet does this

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,159
mean something to you

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,760
i hope it does

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:30,159
because we all long to belong to be part

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,559
of something meaningful and together

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,240
while being apart we can truly make a

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,480
huge difference

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
where is everybody where is everybody

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,760
we're all here

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,799
we are all here our communities are

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
still here

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,039
virtually together and they still need

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
you we all still need you

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,840
the world needs us more than ever right

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
now

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
thank you

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,799
thank you grace we really appreciate the

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,120
presentation and the

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,039
handling of all these topics i have some

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,640
questions that i'd love to ask you based

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,360
on some conversation that's been going

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
on

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,520
in the stage chat so there's a few

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
points one is that

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,440
i think a lot of people myself included

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,720
have been experiencing

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,279
um video conferencing fatigue um

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,080
uh gabor posted an article that suggests

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,919
that

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
because of the way video conferences

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,279
work just the the idea of staring at

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,400
faces for so long

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,600
stresses are our sort of social brains

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,880
uh quite a bit in in a video uh context

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,039
is there something that you've done

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,919
maybe with your own teams to help

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,320
find ways to to to create space to

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,960
recover from that constant feeling of of

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,640
being on those conference calls

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,240
that's that's really difficult to do

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
unless you have some way of social

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,000
distancing

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,919
in person um and i know that like

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,279
microsoft just recently released some

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
new version of their

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,279
i think it's called their teams platform

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,960
and they're trying to simulate people

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,960
being in like a theater

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,159
i don't think that meets necessarily

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
that kind of demand

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,320
i mean it removes the brady bunch feel

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
on the muppet landfill but

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,960
and then transfers it into seats in an

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,159
auditorium but it doesn't give you that

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,960
uh that human connection that is so

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
badly needed it's like an innate feeling

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,360
and need that we all have

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
to be able to see eye to eye so when i

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,919
find

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,840
for presentations for instance i have

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,679
this webcam that sits up on top of my

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
large monitor that i use for work every

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
day

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
but for formats like this i find using

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
the webcam

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
on my laptop is actually better because

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,520
it simulates that eye to eye

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,720
a little bit better than if you have on

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,400
top of a big screen

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
because then it's looking down upon you

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
you're not really looking there's

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,200
really no eye-to-eye kind of motion

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,279
there so this at least

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,039
helps with that so if you're really

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,279
trying to simulate that eye to eye

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,200
like connection it's better to actually

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
use your laptop webcam because

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,120
then you're a little bit closer to

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,880
having that

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,960
that situation where you're looking at a

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,440
person and it looks like you're looking

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,520
at them

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
versus a webcam that's on top of a big

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,120
screen

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
yeah and actually on the subject of eye

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
contact there's a nice conversation

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,880
going on

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,320
for people um like myself to a degree

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
and like others who are a little bit on

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
the sort of neurodivergent spectrum

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,240
sometimes we're not used to eye contact

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
in general and in some ways

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,279
we either haven't noticed that we're not

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,600
getting the same

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,120
sort of eye contact that we used to or

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
when we're presented with a lot of

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,919
people

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,279
looking at us with all the eyes at once

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,960
it can be a little overwhelming so

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,760
there's places where it's different from

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,760
your

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,080
um you know where you are on the

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,919
neurotypical neurodivergent spectrum

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,159
and and for just people who learn and

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,039
interact and socialize in different ways

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,440
um i find also a lot of people are doing

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,440
sort of

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,960
social happy hour things on zoom or

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,720
house party whatever platform they're

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,679
using and

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,000
they're you're completely missing the

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,400
social cues you usually have in person

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,159
that it's okay now to think and then

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,919
someone becomes very vocal

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,679
speaking speaking all the time then at

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,559
some point during a happy hour i had

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
last week with

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,159
some old colleagues and my this person

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,240
was like oh god this is

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,520
right this this is hard because i'm

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
missing this little accused of

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,279
politeness where

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
it's like time for me to shut up like

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,919
yes

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,679
there are lots of things that you see

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,600
like 50 i think like 50

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,080
or more of communication is body

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,799
language and you're only seeing this

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,000
so you know it's it's hard to see those

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,679
social cues

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
yeah i think it's difficult and i think

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,000
in some ways we can

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,840
maybe introduce new temporary forms of

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,600
body language like the raised hand on

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,679
the video call certainly can help

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,120
just to just someone get noticed and i'm

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
sure there's other things that people

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,080
are

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,919
discovering and coming up with i want to

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,559
go back to something you said earlier

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,720
about

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,720
that sense of it goes along with the

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
sense of video conference fatigue but

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
also sort of just the generalized sense

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,640
of fatigue and sort of being overwhelmed

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,880
because

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
we simultaneously feel totally

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
disconnected

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,960
from our societies and and our uh

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,720
communities in particular

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,200
but also feel over connected to the news

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
and the narrative and the constant um

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
updates whether it's about the pandemic

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,320
or about um about the protests or about

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,200
whatever else is happening

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,880
um do you have any thoughts or advice on

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,760
managing the news feed and

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,240
and um taking a break when you feel like

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,240
you're

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
you've already been at home all day you

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,799
know yeah

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,559
yeah so i have a couple of things that

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,720
i've been learning to do

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,320
and to adjust in this new world of ours

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
which is in the beginning when we got

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,880
into shelter and place of course just

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,880
like everyone else i was consuming

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
whatever news item i could get because

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,159
we're just trying to figure out what the

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,279
heck is happening um

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,880
and but at some point it was the same

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,440
really or very similar from day to day

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,039
today and you have to put limits

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,720
so you have to then set limits on how

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,039
much you're going to assume when

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
you consume it during the day i

00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
recommend not doing it before you go to

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,600
bed

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,640
so that you're not having like issues

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,240
going to sleep

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,159
so that's what is less setting limits on

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,720
how much and when you're actually

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,399
watching i think that's really important

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,760
i also think that

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,120
in general the thing that helps me to

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,279
offset

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,240
like feeling bad or feeling stuck or

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,039
whatever it is is

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,000
i will reach out and do something to

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,840
help

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,120
someone because in helping someone i

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
feel like i've done something with

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,200
purpose on something positive

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,320
so even if we can't fix all the big

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
world problems

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,880
we can do like one positive thing during

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
the day no matter how bad our day

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
feels it actually helps a ton to lift us

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
up as individuals

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,120
to keep going because we are in a

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,120
marathon right now not a sprint this is

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,960
not a short-term pandemic so we have to

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,760
think about it from that perspective

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,559
and so in managing that chaos and how

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,559
that's

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,399
affecting us holistically we need to

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,679
think about stepping outside of

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,279
ourselves and think about how can we

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,760
help others because in doing that

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,399
actually will help you feel good yeah

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,000
and i think i found it useful as well to

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
what one of the things i've experienced

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
is this sense that

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,399
um all of the days blur together when

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
i'm in the same location the same office

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,640
in my house like it becomes hard to

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
distinguish the distance of

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,000
you know was that just when i'm thinking

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,520
about what happened am i thinking about

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
a week's worth of time a day it all

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,960
blurs together

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,399
and one of the things that has started

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,679
helping me i've only just started doing

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,760
this is actually journaling

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,720
some of those individual unique moments

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
whether it's oh

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,840
this is the day we managed to help out

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,000
with something um

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,520
or something else just so that i have

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,720
some milestones

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,159
some landmarks in in the flow of days um

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,080
to know what's going on

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
yeah and i try to keep up with the

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,240
routines that i had before

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
all this happened and for me that

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,360
routine included

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,799
exercising a certain number of days

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,760
during the week of course that fell off

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,240
in the beginning as

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,000
things were sort of hectic and crazy but

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,120
now i'm getting back into that routine

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,519
because

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,039
that using acts like headspace helped me

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,559
balance my day because i have a crazy

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,240
day even without a pandemic

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,399
happening so you know i'm

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,080
re-implementing those things because

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,760
you know like i said it's a marathon our

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,200
work is still hard it's even harder with

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,799
the pandemic

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
and as leaders we also have to always

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,200
think about how are we taking care of

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,200
people

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,039
but that's always on my mind and if i'm

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,919
not taking care of myself i can't take

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,120
care of others

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,880
right so you always have to think about

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,640
how you are taking care of yourself

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,200
first and then also lending a hand where

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
you can

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,679
with others yeah i think i'll ask one or

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,480
two more questions before we probably

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
wrap here

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,320
so one is just a really interesting one

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,559
that you mentioned um

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,640
a gaming platform being repurposed for

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,480
community and these sorts of events

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,399
and several of our audience members

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,279
chimed in in different ways to talk

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,799
about these

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,720
kinds of things that they've seen or

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
participated in in other places so

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,440
whether it's

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,039
people setting up maybe just for

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,159
socializing an animal crossing

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,480
experience

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,279
um and playing that on the nintendo

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,320
switch

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,000
or um matt saunders passed on

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,919
that there's a group called the

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
non-profit commons that he had helped

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,320
found

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,080
back in the early 2000s that operates in

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,880
second life and has been operating since

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,039
then

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,279
kind of personally perfectly positioned

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,519
for the same kind of virtual experience

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
do you think that there's something it's

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,159
strange because i've seen this in other

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,840
places whether it's twitch or

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,840
all these other platforms there's there

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,360
has been a hey can we repurpose these

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,240
gaming social

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,720
uh spaces for other kinds of social

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,120
space

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,000
um yeah isolated is there something is

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,399
there something unique

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,919
to the platforms built for this gaming

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,159
experience that you think is why they

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,159
theirs was so well suited what's unique

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
about gaming platforms is from

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,600
the beginning they are thinking about

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,399
scale and performance

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,840
every single like minute of the day

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,799
right because every minute that they

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,799
lose they're losing

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,399
thousands and thousands of players

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,320
they're very data driven

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,399
in order to be successful i know this

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
from working at roblox so

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,440
i know how much you know data you have

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,039
to work with to understand like

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
you know how you know how are servers

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,200
performing how many users are on the

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,799
platform how are we performing globally

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
those are things that really great

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,799
gaming platforms think about

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,320
constantly so they are set up for

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,240
success when it comes to the massive

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,399
scale we're now inherently asking all

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,600
these platforms to support when we have

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,039
big virtual events so we're taxing the

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,760
heck out of traditional

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,360
events platforms but it's interesting

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
the gaming platforms are ready to go

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,480
the things that they're missing are the

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,120
things that like marketing people are

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
looking for

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,320
on these traditional events platforms

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,440
such as lead generation and marketing

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,360
components and

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,960
simulating some actually you can do is

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,760
you can simulate just like you saw with

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
adrian swag she had mongodb swag she

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,679
could

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,200
virtually give that out so that is

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,080
possible already on

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,840
platforms like roblox and um sorry about

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,039
that

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,039
all part of working from home

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,360
um and and roblox so you know there are

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,120
components that are missing

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,360
but the scale and performance and the

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,159
global nature of these platforms is all

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,000
there and untapped so i think that as

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
this pandemic continues i

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,360
kind of expect that some of these gaming

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,480
platforms are going to provide some of

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,320
these experiences

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,520
and it provides a nice engaging

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,520
experience so while it's not

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
you you because obviously that picture

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,879
was their avatar

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,399
selves that gave people an opportunity

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,079
to still kind of feel like they were

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,000
engaging in a room

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
you know being in the theater or seeing

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,079
a presentation asking the

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,800
person questions she did a simultaneous

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,560
twitch stream

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,919
as well as part of that so sort of like

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,079
multi-channel

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,240
but um i think that that we're going to

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,879
see more and more of over the year

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,399
great and i saw one uh comment one final

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,800
comment in the chat that i just want to

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,639
share

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
because i think it's good for everyone

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,960
else to see um

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,639
uh it's really important to figure out

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,440
how you set boundaries between work and

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,879
personal life

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
when you're in a remote space when your

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,800
home is your workplace whether that is

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,320
having a home office if you're fortunate

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,159
enough to have your own space

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,440
where you can close the door and be done

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,200
with work for the day

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,280
or if you have some other ritual you can

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,440
develop that is how you know that you're

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,880
done with that particular work i know

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,320
for a while when i didn't have a home

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,839
office what i would do is have a

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,520
different user account i use the same

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,119
computer for work and personal

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,280
life but at least i could sign out of

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,440
the work one and know okay that that

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,359
represented the end of my day

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,200
um so i hope that's helpful for the

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,800
audience listening in grace any final

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
remarks for our audience before we close

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,520
it out

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,880
any final thoughts yeah we're all

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,320
learning as we go

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
we'd love to hear what everyone else is

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
trying to do right now in order to stay

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
engaged

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,240
to relate to other people would love to

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
hear those tips and tricks

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,280
um totally with you on the making sure

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,720
that you set the boundaries in your

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,240
workspace whether it's like physically

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,119
packing up your stuff as if you've

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,440
traveled to

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,839
like a hot spot destination and then

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,920
packing your stuff up like okay now it's

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,839
not it's home life like sometimes you

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,880
have to have that rigor to draw those

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,880
lines and to have

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,400
that time with your family your partners

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,960
your pets whatever it is that you like

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,440
to do

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,400
so that you're not just constantly

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
constantly just

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
in your work space again you have to

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
take care of yourselves

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,240
before you can take care of others so

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
it's important to think about that

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
awesome okay well thank you very much

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,720
grace thank you for coming

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
thank you for being one of our board

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,160
members and helping guide the drupal

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,200
association as we work through this

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,119
uh difficult time learning how to have a

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,320
remote community events like this as

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,800
well

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,599
we're all very thrilled to have you here

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,680
and with that

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,640
we'll release our audience to go take a

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,400
quick short break

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
set up your next schedules all of that

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,240
sort of stuff thank you very much

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,160
for attending everyone um we're gonna

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,079
stop broadcasting i'm gonna leave it an

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,440
extra few seconds here

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,200
because i think hopefully that way we

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
won't cut off the last few minutes so

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,680
we'll have a few seconds of silence and

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,839
close it off

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,839
