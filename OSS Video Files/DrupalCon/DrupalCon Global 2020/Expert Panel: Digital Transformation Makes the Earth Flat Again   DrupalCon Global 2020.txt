00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,239
overall digital experience platform

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
fantastic excellent well uh good segue

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,040
ricardo thanks for for mentioning that

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,000
we're going to kick things off

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,520
with our first question here here we are

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
it's virtual drupalcon

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
the mecca of drupal all four of you

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
represent agencies who are among the top

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
contributors to drupal

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
and i happen to know that that is very

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
intentional

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,960
so why is it so important for you and

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,199
your agency justin let's start with you

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
yeah uh we do contribute a lot it's

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
expensive and

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,840
and there's time involved and impacts

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,639
client work um

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,880
i think about open source like uh sort

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
of like a financial system like a bank

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
and like banks are great they're apart

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,199
well usually banks are great they're

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
part of a community

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,240
you know they lend capital out they take

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
deposits and they're you know they let

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,759
people do really interesting things and

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
so

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
you know every time you use something

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,160
that's open source whether it's like

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
drupal or wordpress or apache or

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
whatever

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,000
you're making a withdrawal from um

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
a bank right the bank of drupal and you

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
know every time you install a

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
contributing module update like you keep

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
making withdrawals

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
and the thing about a bank is if you

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,600
make withdrawals all the time and nobody

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,280
makes deposits then it doesn't really

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
work as a bank and it fails pretty

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,639
quickly so

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,160
for for us it's really a best practice

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
like when you participate in open source

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
community

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,120
you're constantly benefiting like we all

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
know this right we benefit from

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
everyone's contributions and work and

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,960
all the bug fixes and features and

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,880
everything and so

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,360
um it's sort of being a good citizen

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
of that community and you know you you

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
can constantly take the trials but

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
occasionally you've got to make a

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
deposit

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,360
so that's why we do it that's how we

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
think about it

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,400
i like that that's a nice analogy i

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,960
haven't heard that one before but it

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,840
makes a lot of sense uh felicia you want

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,520
to uh address it for uh your group

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,759
yeah i feel like it might sound a little

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,960
bit the same i think there's a lot of uh

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,400
commonality here

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
you know one of our values is to share

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,080
knowledge openly so contributing is

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,919
really important to us as a company but

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,000
drupal's one of the top technologies we

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,240
use because it's flexible it's rich it's

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,400
supported by this huge community

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
and it really is a community and you

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
don't get a vibrant community without

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,919
giving back to it and the more you get

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
from the community the more you need to

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,400
get back to that community and i feel

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,840
like phase two we get a lot

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,919
so excellent

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
how about you ricardo why is drupal so

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
important to you guys

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,360
yeah i mean i'm gonna i'm gonna echo

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
everything justin and felicia just said

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
i

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,680
totally totally agreed with that um and

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
i i think that

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
you know specifically like contributing

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
back to the community and finding

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,600
different ways to contribute back to the

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,199
community because

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
obviously right there's there's a lot

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,599
that we can do and a lot that we

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,039
all do with like the um contribution of

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
development back to the community but

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
also

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,319
i'm giving back in ways that allow us to

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
get together as a community right so one

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
of the things that we do

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
across a lot of the different locations

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
that we're at

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,800
is focus on how we can help uh things

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
like drupal camps happen and

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
you know drupal trainings happen so that

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
we're bringing new folks into the

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,720
community

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
and really creating a place for for that

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
community to get together because i

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
think the

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
you know it's a rising tide the uh those

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,960
of us that are in the community as we

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
get better together and contribute back

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
to it and

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,199
create spaces for all of us to evolve

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,199
that helps all of us

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,360
and josh anything you'd like to add yeah

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
echo all of that um on one of our

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
podcasts recently i heard it summed up

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
like this

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,880
if you depend on open source software it

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
depends on you

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
so there's so many benefits to talk

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
about i think a good way to sum it up is

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
when we contribute to something together

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,599
collectively we all reap the benefits of

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,599
it

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
so what we all need to keep in mind is

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,919
just how do we keep that momentum going

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
how do we lead by example how do we help

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
our clients

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,080
thus those on the agency side we serve

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
clients how do we help them

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
understand the value of contributing

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
back so there's a lot of

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,599
community benefits but there's

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
tremendous business benefits there's

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
tremendous employee learning

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,840
opportunities

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,080
for all of us that we need to continue

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,520
to underscore and then lastly

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
you know um contributions go well beyond

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
code

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
uh justin mentioned it you know

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,280
sponsorships uh

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,039
are a big part of you know making sure

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
drupalcon happens every year

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,879
case studies assault leadership all

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
those are considered contributions and

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
we're just trying to

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
lead by example and keep those things

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
going

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
that's great well that's well said by

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
all of you and uh we certainly

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,880
appreciate

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,279
everything you guys do for the community

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,959
uh sorry let me bring it back to today's

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
session title because we had some fun

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
with it uh ricardo

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,080
when we spoke the other day you were

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
actually the one to make the comment

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
about the world being flat again that

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
inspired the title

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
can you talk a little bit more about

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
what that means to you

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
yeah sure and i guess i i should start

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
saying that for the record i don't

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,080
believe the earth is actually flat

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
right but i think that even given what

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
what we're talking about

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
it seemed like a good metaphor because

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,560
really and we're all feeling

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,160
right and just wanted to make sure since

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
you know i know this has been recorded

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,640
and it's going to be

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,080
out somewhere but um and we're we're all

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
feeling it and it's really

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
um you know because the the five of us

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
were talking about how it's really been

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,240
an acceleration in the trends that we've

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
all been seeing for

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,480
decades right um and really the way that

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,519
i think about it is like the perceived

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,720
distance between

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,640
us has shrunk right like all of us as as

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
humans but also as uh

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
as professionals in digital

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,000
professionals in business right

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,680
uh our relationship with with our

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
customers our clients relationships with

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
their

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,920
with our customers it's like it's so

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,920
so uh with everything moving online

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,080
there's just like distance is not really

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,200
a factor the way that it was six months

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,360
ago right

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
and of course we've all been

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,160
experiencing this personally but like

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
one of the things that i keep coming

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
back to

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
and just in my mind and thinking about

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
is at the beginning of

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
uh quarantine shelter in place in new

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
york times ran this article that was

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,120
called the virus changed the way we

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
internet right and i think that it

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,320
really changed the way that we

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
live life the way we internet and i

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
think that you know

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
all of us being on the digital agency

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,800
side right um

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
the the platform side with aqua it's

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,399
like really our responsibility to help

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
the organizations that we work with

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
navigate through what that you know

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,240
changing the way we internet changing

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,720
the way we live life really means

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,680
and how uh the reality of everything

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,680
feeling like

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
it's closer because it's moved to

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
digital right like

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,000
that that impacts all of us as a

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,000
business and all of us as a community

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,040
i think can i can i add to that oh sorry

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,240
please do

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
yeah no that's a great record i like

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
this idea of it being flat i think the

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
other component to it too

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
is sort of its breath and i sort of i

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
imagine like a big crt monitor on a desk

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
in like the 90s

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,279
and how big a computer was and like a

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
big tower and like you could see it was

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
like the keyboard

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
everything was massive right um and now

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,880
it's just like you might sit down in a

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
chair with a laptop and sort of work and

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
so like

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
technology visibly is sort of almost

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
shorter in that it's like less

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
visible because it's smaller and more

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
compact and there's phones

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
but it's all like the breath is so much

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,959
wider right into your to your point of

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
it being flat like

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,560
it's spread throughout the whole world

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
from you know devices

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,920
to you know to computers to just like

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
technology powering everything so

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,360
um flattening yes and i would say like

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
breath too

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
is is another way to think about how

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,000
it's just it's just sort of everywhere

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
now but but kind of just below the

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
surface

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
yeah i love that way of thinking about

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
it

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,279
nice i have found the last you know

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,279
four months six months whatever to be

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
this wild adjustment for us and all

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,399
things right

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
things we may have thought of as extras

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,440
or just nice to haves

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
or things that i thought of as you know

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
frivolities i liked like instacart

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
are suddenly just the way you do

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
business

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,720
they're the way we live and that's true

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
for

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,279
um our clients as well and the people we

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,040
work with and serve

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,639
anything that helps replace those

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
in-person interactions

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
or just creates completely new digital

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
experiences for people

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,639
is jump to the top of this and become so

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,399
critical to help us connect

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
and and i just like i said i think about

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,160
those things that i used to think of

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,600
just a few months ago is wow should i

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
really am i being

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,839
extra bougie by getting my groceries

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
delivered

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,200
it has suddenly become just a core way

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
everybody has to live their life

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
i think it's really highlighted the

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
importance of the technology

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,480
sorry yeah i'm um i'm fortunate enough

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,800
to be a pool owner

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
and there's a new app that's out that my

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,079
wife told me about that you can now run

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,839
out your pool for the day at like

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,519
100 bucks an hour or something um

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
yeah so it's just it's really it's

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,079
really flipped everything's upside down

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
but what i'm most proud

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,440
of is how all of our clients have

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
responded

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,320
and leaned in and didn't take it as a

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,320
moment to say woe is me but to really

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
challenge themselves to

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
look at their business differently we

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
always said digital

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
it's always it always says digital first

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,880
now i feel like it's digital only

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,040
we work with an insurance organization

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,000
and posted a new page today about

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,120
tele dentistry so i don't know what that

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
looks like yet

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,040
but um that's going to be interesting to

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
explore

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,200
so it's all around us and i'm just proud

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
of the way our clients just responded to

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
this pandemic with

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,040
challenging themselves to address it

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,800
head-on josh i'm just imagining like a

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,600
significant other holding a chisel

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,920
to their like mouth and then the dentist

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,600
is like no no hit that tooth

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,880
yeah i was thinking of a dremel tool

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,480
yeah a similar similar image

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,920
we are frightening some of the audience

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
members right now

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,480
um no but i think i think josh may i was

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,680
right no no go ahead justin

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
well no i just i think josh makes a

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
really good point though like so many

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
organiz

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,959
organizations sort of get what we all do

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
right we get stuck and like we do x

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
because like we always did x

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
right and i talked to a cfo of a client

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
of ours uh

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,639
like two months ago like in the sort of

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,399
the worst part of the lockdown and he

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
said justin we had four hours to go from

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,120
100 in office to 100

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,880
virtual and um we all resisted remote

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,240
work for years and we had four hours of

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,920
warning and we've had no problems

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,279
like and so all they needed was an

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
assumption challenge they didn't have to

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,839
figure out anything technologically it

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
was sort of all there

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
so i love josh's sort of idea of like

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,160
digital only because it's much

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
it's much easier than i think um once

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,680
you sort of break the habit

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
yeah nice nice and that's something i

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
want to drill into

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
to next right because because without a

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,240
doubt this new reality

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
look whether you call the new normal

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,800
we've been calling it the new reality

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
um you know that covid has brought about

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
is impacting businesses

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,079
in very different ways and um there are

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,680
many organizations that

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
do seem to be weathering the storm

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
pretty well some

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
many who are even thriving right and so

00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,920
what i want to know is

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
what's been the key for these

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,639
organizations that are doing well

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
through this time

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
you know is it a return to basics and

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
fundamentals or is it more about

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
acceleration of transformation

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,120
felicia maybe we can start with you what

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
have you seen

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,800
well i think it has been an acceleration

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,760
of digital transformation

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,160
but mixing that with a lot of creativity

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,800
and

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
and really leaning into your purpose

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,440
right

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,959
i think of our partner at score who

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,959
helps small businesses

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,480
and this was a time for them to search

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,680
forward and reach out to people

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
and use the tools they had to get the

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,959
message out and explain to small

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,440
businesses how they could help them

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,720
we worked with them on the resilience

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
campaign to reach out to businesses and

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,199
get the support they needed in a really

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
trying time

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,040
um for others they really are doubling

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
down on their transformation

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
you know weight watchers got laser

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
focused on getting

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
virtual meetings up because that's where

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
their customers were and that's where

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,920
they needed to be um

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,160
we've seen different clients across

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,920
industries adapt and get creative

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
they're finding ways to grow stronger

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,199
like particularly healthcare healthcare

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,040
has amazed me

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,880
in the last couple months not just for

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,639
the reasons we all already know about

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
about being on the front lines and

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
really

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
you know being the ones fighting the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
pandemic

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,800
um i'm in awe of people like morthwell

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
where they are at northwell health and

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
long island where they're in the middle

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
of this

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,720
and yet they're still keeping the gas on

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
their digital transformation

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
even though they're swamped in the

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
middle of the crisis because

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,120
they know that's what they need to do to

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,399
serve their patients now that's what

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,399
they're going to need to do to serve

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,680
their patients for the next

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:40,240
several months and possibly years

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:44,399
so yeah when i when i think of um

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,040
transformation i think of disruption and

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
one of the things that we were really

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,519
challenged with

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,040
is getting kobit related content

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,600
to the web quickly and speed

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
speed to market is a disruption on its

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,199
own when you're a full-service drupal

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,199
agency you're used to having time to do

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,120
your strategy map out your sprints now

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,160
the sudden you got three weeks to get a

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,079
a full sight up that um

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,760
you know disrupts your normal workflow

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
but it really gives you the opportunity

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
to

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,720
to you know partner more closely with

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,039
your clients and then challenge yourself

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,559
as a developer as an agency to do things

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,400
differently right because necessity is

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,199
the mother of invention

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,400
but yeah i agree with with a lot of

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
those statements

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,799
healthcare has been doing a really good

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,240
job of trying to send the message

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,400
in a in a easy way

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
for when patients can actually get back

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,080
into the healthcare facilities and you

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
can't give them a book that's

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,679
20 pages deep you got to give them a few

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,919
pages it's easy to get through

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,520
it just sends a really uh calming

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,200
message that they're ready to

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,039
to to help you out

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
i will say i've seen it across several

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
of our clients it's really fun when

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
somebody comes to you

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
and says i gotta get this site up we've

00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
got to get this covered up and we're

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
like

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
do you remember that stuff we built for

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,240
you

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,840
[Laughter]

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
yeah josh and felicia make great points

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,280
i mean

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
i this whole situation has reminded me

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
that like sometimes

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
hustle is strategy hustle is business

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,400
strategy hustle is digital strategy and

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,440
like the organizations that are thriving

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,520
i think to their point

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
i totally agree they just they just

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
threw things out the window

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
adapted and tried new things right um

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
and and you have to and i think that's

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,880
why

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,039
personally we're always excited about

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
drupal when we talk with clients and

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,080
a really great cloud platform and why

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
and why we often recommend

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,039
aqua is because you need those tools

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
that make you faster not things that

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
slow you down because when these

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,799
situations hit like you need something

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,039
that's flexible

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,240
and open that you can just like rapidly

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,400
do some tele dentistry to josh's client

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
um you need you need you need the but

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
you need the tools right like it can't

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,600
it has to look easy to other people that

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,120
you're able to move this quickly it

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
never is but you want to make it look

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,760
easy so

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
muscle strategy would be what i would

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,360
say yeah

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,720
nice so yeah let's uh let's spend a

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
little bit more time talking about

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,840
websites

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
um some of you may have heard that aqua

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
recently announced it's going to be

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
supporting triple 7 on aqua cloud

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
now through 2024 uh sort of extending

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
the end of life

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
um there are probably some folks in the

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,559
audience today who are on drupal 7

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
or maybe they're on eight and they're

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
thinking about how to guide their

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,679
organizations now that nine is here

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
uh josh i know that this is a

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
conversation you're having with a lot of

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
your clients

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
what kind of advice are you offering in

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,120
these situations

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,000
wow that's a biggie um well it's

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,039
important questions

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,679
for a lot of reasons

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,120
it's been a tough budget year for most

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,679
number one

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
number two um you know the move from

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,720
drupal 7

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,840
typically requires a significant

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,120
investment and number three you know

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,120
the extension of of d7

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,400
end of life was was really well received

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,280
i think it was really needed on

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,640
a lot of fronts so i think that was a

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,360
great decision

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:15,039
to do but what what we typically advise

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,080
is if kovids taught us anything

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,679
i mean when the going gets tough the

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,720
tough get going

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,200
so on the business side

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,880
when clients start trimming budgets it

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,080
could impact your agency

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,520
so rather than um

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,240
you know cut staff or

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,200
take your marketing budget off the off

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
the sheet

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,120
it's really time to be doubling down to

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,000
get more awareness for your

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,600
organization and it's also anytime

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
you're looking to do an upgrade it's a

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,720
great time to look at your digital

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
strategy overall

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
so it's not only like the drupal piece

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,799
it's the face of your franchise

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
it's the digital presence that's more

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,039
important than ever

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
and you may need to borrow ahead a few

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,320
years to get the benefits

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,240
now and then i i don't think um

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
we should forget that you know the

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,159
drupal community wants to work on

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,039
new drupal not old drupal uh d7 is great

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
supported a lot of us for a lot of years

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,440
but

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,039
you know those that want to stay on the

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,799
bleeding edge of technologies don't want

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
to support a

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,840
platform that's dated so you could run

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
into some

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,000
recruiting and retention issues there

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,480
too so i think it's changing the mindset

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,559
of treating it as an opportunity to

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
um you know double down look at your

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
digital strategy how it's supporting

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
your business

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,080
and use that to build a business case

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
around the investment

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,360
and then you know down the road it's

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,640
obviously obviously going to be much

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,440
much easier

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,039
so um you can look at uh building the

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
business case that

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
this upgrade could support you for the

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,880
next you know 10 years or so

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,799
easy yeah i i totally agree with what

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,640
what you're saying josh because there is

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,240
there's so much benefit and value in the

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
work that the community is

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,000
currently doing and doing in the near

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,919
future right as well as like kind of the

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,559
roadmap looking at drupal in the long

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,919
term

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,280
and so that's something that we help

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,880
clients take a look at right the

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
organizations we work with and really

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,120
look at the decision from that level

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,799
is like we you know anyone that's on

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
drupal 7 should be weighing

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,320
what are the cost versus benefit of

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,039
sitting with sticking with the

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,600
d7 and just because you can should you

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
right and

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
understanding what some of like the

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
great improvements that have um happened

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
in drupal 8 are now happening with

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
drupal 9 or

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,039
going into drupal 10 right which uh i

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,200
know three

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,080
started touching upon uh earlier this

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
week right

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,520
really understanding like are those

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,640
things that you would benefit from

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,640
um sooner than the d7 end of life date

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,840
great go ahead please

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,039
please sorry i'm just enjoying that

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,640
josh really summed up a lot of what i've

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,720
been telling clients and it's been

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
you know we're getting a little bit of a

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,520
stay

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,880
uh state of execution it's a terrible

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
way to put it but

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,520
we're getting a little bit more time

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,159
than we had and some people that were

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,559
re-platforming just to re-platform

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,159
get the opportunity to now breathe about

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,159
and really think about their strategy

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,679
and how they want to transform not just

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
rush

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,799
to get off seven which is which is nice

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,799
but there isn't

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,799
a reason to just wait yep either all

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,360
right so so on that theme sort of of you

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,720
know

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,320
rushing and and having urgency or uh or

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,320
or taking your time

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
um you know when you think about digital

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
transformation

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,520
it really isn't something that you would

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,120
recommend to organizations

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,640
just wing it right you'll figure it out

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
approach it casually

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
um ricardo again this is something we

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,440
talked about the other day right

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,279
what are maybe some of those important

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
frameworks and roadmaps that you like to

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,520
educate and guide your clients around

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,520
yeah that's a it's a really good

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
question and it fits really well into

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
the

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,400
you know drupal 7 drupal aaa drupal 9

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,640
and that roadmap because i

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,520
um i do think that like when you're

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,520
thinking about

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
the frameworks i i really think there's

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,200
two parts to it right and i

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,120
i know we don't have like this could be

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
a whole two-hour session that i'm sure

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
we could all speak to on

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
on how to how to go about planning but i

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
think at a high level it's really

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
uh comes down to two things the first

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,000
one is building understanding and

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
consensus within your organization on

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the why you're taking on a digital

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,520
initiative right which goes to exactly

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
what josh and felicia were just saying

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
with

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,240
drupal 7 2 drupal 8 to drupal 9. and

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,400
then second creating

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
that roadmap that plan that really

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
starts outlining the what

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,400
the when the how and the who right

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,880
because i think that one of the

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,039
um one of the mistakes that i know um

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
i've i've personally made in the past in

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,559
in my career i know a lot of

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,000
organizations do is equating digital to

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,840
just technology

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,360
right and digital really means so much

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,799
more than technology and you need

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,400
successful collaboration across

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,880
different business areas

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,720
right whether it's user experience and

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,919
content strategy and how that feeds into

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,200
the decisions you're making on the

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
technology stack

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,480
considerations that you have for

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,799
customer data privacy

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
how you're using that data right in your

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,360
experimentation and optimization

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,039
practice

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
if you don't have a roadmap to kind of

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,559
answer those five big questions of like

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,440
the why what

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,919
what when how and who right um i feel

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,840
like

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,080
you you'll make some progress but you

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,799
won't get to where you want to be

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,799
years from now

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,200
excellent anybody else around the room

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,320
that uh that has thoughts on like

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,080
certain frameworks that you like to

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,679
highlight as you're as you're getting

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,760
underway with digital transformation

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,039
initiatives

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,480
i mean i i think we can all agree that

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,760
um requirements and gaining consensus on

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
what's important is

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,960
always really difficult especially in

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
the large enterprise

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
but and i know in higher ed an area we

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,880
spend a lot of time in

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,799
we're rethinking just what that you know

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,320
digital experience looks like

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,720
uh with covid i mean here's a university

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
where

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
you may not be able to get on campus so

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,600
how do you

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,880
describe your culture in a virtual

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,640
setting and is your messaging

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,600
the way it's always been in covid in

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
converting prospective applicants to

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,279
students

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,039
so it's a complete reinvention of

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,240
messaging on a lot of fronts and a lot

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,360
of different verticals

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,000
and that requires a lot of conversation

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
a lot of you know data driven strategy

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,360
work

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,520
and really just talking to the audience

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,799
and the personas that you need to hit

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,279
and getting their input on what they're

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,799
expecting

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
i think that was the one thing i was

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,159
going to add because i really love that

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,279
ricardo started with

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,200
the why why are you doing this

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
and then making sure you get consensus

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
and somewhere

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,159
right in the middle there is also be

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,559
prepared to be surprised

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,520
when you dig into your research and the

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,200
data

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
because it really is about what you were

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,600
saying josh and meeting your

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,480
your customers your patients your

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,720
students where they are and today it may

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,000
be very different than it was yesterday

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,000
um there's also really this it's not

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
so much a transformation there's no

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,760
butterfly at the end of this

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
it's let's tackle the first most

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
important thing and then we're gonna get

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,520
the next one

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
and the next one and the next one it's

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,840
never done

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
um

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,480
sorry i thought you were done go ahead i

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,840
am done now

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,919
it's a little delight no i love what you

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,880
said about data it's so true um i love

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,600
that escape

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
ceo quote um if we have data we're going

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,679
with that if all we have our opinions

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,679
we're going with mine

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
data's data is a great way to all of

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
your ricotta and collections points a

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,799
great way to sort of focus

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
and get decision makers aligned i

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,840
totally agree

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,919
yeah that's a fantastic quote i got to

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,919
write that one down yeah i love that

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,279
and what you said felicia also reminded

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
me that like it's you know it's

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,640
important to look at

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
um topics of transformation and kind of

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
the long-term strategy but it's just as

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,399
important to look at the

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,240
you know operations and execution of

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,159
that long-term strategy that you have

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,840
because somewhere along the middle like

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,520
you said felicia right like something

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,600
unexpected will happen you'll have to

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,640
shift and you know rethink how you're

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,640
going about your plan

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
pretty sure the drupalcon planners had

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,360
that happen to them at some point this

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,679
year

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,919
yeah so awesome job pivoting

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
all right let's hang on this theme of

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
data that you guys just brought up and

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,080
and justin you are a great source of

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,640
amusing and amazing quotes um

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,320
so i think we seem to agree that the new

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
customer experience and

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,559
our collective definition of omni

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,960
channel is now digital first

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,720
uh but my question is is that enough

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,880
right uh at acquia

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,840
we don't think so we've put a finder

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
point on it

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,600
and we actually say that in order to do

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,240
digital right you really need to be data

00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
first

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,919
so i'd love to just get some thoughts

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,240
from around the room on this notion of

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
data first as you know a critical

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,240
component to enabling

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
digital first

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,760
anybody can jump in on this one yeah i

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,840
i think i'll i'll jump in real quick and

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,320
um and say i think that it is

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
um you need to it's garbage and garbage

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
out with data right and there's so much

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200
that you can do if you have good data

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,960
and you're kind of analyzing it but

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
if you don't have the right insights on

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,000
it then you know what are you going to

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,320
do with it and it's also about realizing

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,760
their

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,840
steps to it like we're we are working

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,159
with a couple customers right now

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,000
um financial institutions actually where

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,279
um kind of similar to what felice and

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,640
josh were talking about they're thinking

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
about how do they engage with their

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,679
customers and we're

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
helping to put together personalization

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,520
roadmaps right

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
um and some of these customers are using

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600
the aqua

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
they've make sure i get it right because

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,520
it's awkward personal legislation

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
is the name of the product now right as

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,200
of this week

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
um but using that right and and making

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,679
sure that there's kind of a plan

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,200
to again to that idea of road mapping um

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
where like first you need to make sure

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
you gather the data then you use that

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,240
data to build your

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
different audience segments that then

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,960
your you can finally then use to

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,399
bring in that multi-disciplinary team of

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,760
digital experts to

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,360
think about the user experience the

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,240
content the technology so that you're

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
delivering

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,679
meaningful experiences to those

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,919
different audiences for

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
this financial institution so i think

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
it's it's all about taking

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,679
steps to it and being realistic about

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,679
those steps

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
yeah i agree that that's well said for

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,960
cardo data is

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,200
powerful it certainly can be misused but

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,200
it is like the path to finding the way

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,799
forward it makes it easier to measure

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
and actually determine progress when

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,320
you're focused on data

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
at the beginning i think the other

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,760
lesson

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
we've learned over the years with being

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,960
data focused

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,760
is that the probably the most

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,000
valuable data you need is in like five

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,159
percent of the data you gather

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
and often like you don't you're not

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
gathering that five percent it could be

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
an analytics question or it could be

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,640
sort of teasing out like a broader data

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,720
set like a business intelligence but

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,320
it's not just collection like you need

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,840
to collect thoughtfully but then you

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,600
really need to have like good instincts

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,120
i think to really go towards the the

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,799
meaningful pieces of it

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,440
um to to i think substantively add to a

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,559
discussion because

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,960
it can get distracting but um to dave's

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,679
point

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,919
um as well data ultimately i think is

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,600
the best input for a creative experience

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,200
like that that's the input to

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,320
an experience that brings to light to a

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
user and so i think you've got to get

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,519
the data first at the beginning so i

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,120
would agree with what dave said

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,640
yeah i was trying to focus my thoughts

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,919
on this so i didn't ramble because i

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,679
feel like i could ramble for

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,120
about data for a very very long time and

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,360
not make a lot of sense

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,600
and somebody said to me and i loved it

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,480
is data is the representation that

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,440
manifests

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
the manifestation of the customer in our

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
world

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,080
like it's their fingerprint um and so

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,760
it's so critical

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,120
to understand and capture the right

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,159
information to

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,720
identify and and understand them

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,880
so yeah i was i was um excited to see

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,360
the data analyst and the data science

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
position you know come through what we

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,320
do on the website

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
that wasn't the case you know seven

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,880
eight years ago and now it's one of the

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,399
more

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,679
in demand roles we have and then i don't

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,200
think this area is mature at all i mean

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,840
some organizations are having a hard

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,840
time just capturing data

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,320
let alone reading it and cleaning it

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,519
and then we got to continue to ask the

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,960
question why

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,159
and challenge each other when someone

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,880
wants to make a

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,399
significant investment if the if the

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,120
proof's in the pudding there

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,159
and is it just you know someone in a

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,600
board room

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,200
with their hands up in the air because

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,640
it's a preference or is it really going

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
to have an impact

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,320
on the business and that can only be

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,960
proved out with data it's the numbers

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,960
that don't lie

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,799
great thanks guys um

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,720
all right next question uh i think it's

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,200
a safe thing to say that drupalists

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
believe

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,640
that open is better uh many people

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,039
probably associate the term open with

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,679
open source which certainly isn't wrong

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,640
but

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,159
uh to us it's also more than that uh so

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,240
i'm interested to hear your thoughts on

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,159
what open means to each of you and why

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,200
your teams love creating with open

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,880
platforms

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,279
uh justin i happen to know that this is

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,440
something you've got a point of view on

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,799
yeah um so opens a couple can mean

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,919
different things right open source we

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,880
all know that we all know why it's great

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,880
it's why we're all here

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,039
um but open i think in the broader sense

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,399
of um and this is why aqua's positioning

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,440
when it resonates is it's an

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,559
open ecosystem and acquia has a great

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,320
collection of tools

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,000
and you could use some of them all of

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,799
them but they're open

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,919
first so they're okay and happy to have

00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,360
other things that aren't their

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,240
particular technology integrated with

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,799
that stack

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
um and the reason i think that that's

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,679
powerful

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,360
is um something i call like the car boat

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,639
problem so if you like going to youtube

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,919
replacing these videos there's these

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,119
people who always want to make a car

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,040
that's also a boat

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,560
so like you get in your car you drive to

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
the lake and you drive it into the lake

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,200
because it's also a boat but what you

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,320
discover is that when you try to make

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,800
something that's a great car and a great

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,879
boat it's a shitty car and a shitty boat

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,639
so it's really it's really hard to do

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,639
like 20 things really well

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,320
um and so i think that's why open

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
frameworks will end up winning because

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,280
you can take

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
a great you know subset of that solution

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
and then you can plug in one or two

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,119
things that

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
that um into that ecosystem seamlessly

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,240
in that and and uh

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,520
and that platform that does most of it

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,040
is happy to have those other components

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,399
in that ecosystem because um

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,440
you know you want sort of best of breed

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
of sort of every angle of what you're

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
trying to do and

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,040
everyone has different problems so

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that's kind of how i think about open

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,679
and that's why it's um

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
i think it's it provides value to some

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,480
of the clients we talk about

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,200
i think you're absolutely right i didn't

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,640
actually just talk to frank our cto

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
about this for a personal project

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,320
not that long ago and why did we chosen

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,160
open technologies

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,480
as as the way we wanted to work at phase

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,320
two and it was all about

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,920
we want to be able to be flexible and

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,280
make the right decisions and the right

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
moves for our customers and things

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,520
change

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
so fast in this world so everything you

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,760
were saying about you know

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
an open platform and being able to plug

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,359
in the right things at the right time

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,880
completely supports that that's critical

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,400
to reacting to global pandemics and

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,760
several other things that might come

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,079
your way in business

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,720
yeah yeah i think i think the velocity

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,160
is is really an important part of it

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,240
and then being able to shape the

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,480
technology day in day out

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,520
is i think attractive to all of us who

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,920
are

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,560
um blessed to be in this industry where

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,560
we got

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,800
left brain and right brain happening

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,800
every day and nothing's a dull moment

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
we're only as limited by what we can

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,079
conjure up

00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,839
and that's only in the open source arena

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,480
i think the the closed source stuff just

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,920
has a really difficult time keeping up

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
and will eventually run out of gas

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,320
i agree and the the one one note i'll

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
add because i agree with everything

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
that's been said is that open really

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,040
means

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,640
to me uh collaboration right obviously

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,880
we're collaborating

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,160
in drupal as a community like we come

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,160
together drupal com but

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,240
i think it's also important for you know

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
ffw being an agency it's so it's so

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,359
important for us to make sure that we

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
bring that open approach also to just

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,960
our collaboration approach with the

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,200
organizations that we partner with

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,400
right whether that's um on the

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,800
technology

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
platform side as is the case with aqua

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,119
working with our customers

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,160
right it's when you have that open um

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,520
collaboration right it makes things like

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,480
working with one of our

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,359
global retail clients right to shift in

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,320
the

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,520
world of covet 19 much faster because

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
we've already

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
um have that practice of working

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,680
collaboratively and working as an

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,680
integrated team

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,920
excellent thanks go ahead felicia one

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
one last thought on this

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
totally different direction in this one

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,720
of the things

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,599
i i've found is you know we invest in

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,000
mentoring people

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,040
in our organization and growing growing

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,200
new

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,960
uh technologists in the world and that

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,359
is so much easier to do when the tools

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,520
you're

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,280
bringing people up on are free and

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,400
accessible

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,119
um you know if i was trying to if you're

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
trying to

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,720
to teach someone something they had to

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
go buy a license

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,160
for it would be a very different

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,960
experience and a lot

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,960
less accessible

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,760
yes all right well thank you for each

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,839
jumping in on that one

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
uh last question here and before i open

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,240
it up just one last reminder

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,359
for our folks attending today to use the

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,960
q a window

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,720
uh submit some questions and we will

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,680
have a few minutes uh for those at the

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,000
end

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,480
um all right so i host a blog series on

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
aqua.com it's called cmo secrets

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,760
we've had some really incredible guests

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
over the past couple of years including

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,839
acquia's own lin kaposi

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,359
uh one of their favorite moments is when

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,440
i open it up for them to

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,640
rant or rave and i thought i would try

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,160
that here

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,320
so you're each going to get about 30

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,480
seconds to get up on that soapbox talk

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,079
about something you feel strongly about

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,920
could be a great digital experience you

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,079
had a terrible one

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,079
shout out a customer you love maybe it's

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,599
an industry jargon you want to uh you

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,440
know give a plus one for because it's

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,040
underrepresented or something you'd like

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,960
to never hear again

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,160
talk about tick tock talk about quibby

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,960
talk about digital dating

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,680
whatever you want uh 30 seconds anything

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,720
goes

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,160
josh you want to lead us off here yeah

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,040
i just um got a new puppy

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,720
and i was posting the puppy on a popular

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,000
social network

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,839
and within five minutes i had an email

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,800
in my inbox for a retailer looking to

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,000
send me

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,200
and sell puppy related things to me

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,240
i'm now getting a lot more

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,680
ads in my streaming service as i'm binge

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,200
watching

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,119
um related to dog food

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,640
and i'm seeing this connected experience

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,200
that's kind of

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,160
creepy but very relevant and i think

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,359
that's one thing that we all need to

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,040
kind of embrace and start

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,440
collaborating on what good

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,280
personalization and relevancy means

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,560
and it's a really complex topic but i

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
think it's going to be one that's going

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,560
to be

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,119
getting a lot more conversation in the

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,079
uh days months years to come and then

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,520
also just

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,680
i think it's more important for all of

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,440
us just to help each other out so when

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,640
you're working with clients working with

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,720
team members

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,320
take an extra moment just to ask them

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,599
how they're doing and how you can help

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,560
them because we've got to get through

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,480
this together

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,079
and signs are showing is going to be

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,800
longer than we initially thought

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,160
so i just really want to underscore the

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,560
importance of supporting each other

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,520
through this pandemic

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,760
thanks josh nicely done felicia you want

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
to go

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,280
that was a pretty good one from josh i

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,400
was thinking about south park and the

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,720
ads are alive

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,720
um

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,440
we did these predictions for 2019 we set

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,599
out with holiday cards back there and

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,119
then mine was you know 2019 was going to

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,599
be the year of video because you know my

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,119
niece only ever called by facetime and

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,280
and that that was how we were going to

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,720
finally move forward into that world

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,319
um 2020 proved to be that year uh

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,400
for very different reasons than i ever

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,400
expected i was obviously a year off

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,040
but um you know if if nothing else this

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,920
this challenging several months has

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,760
proven to be

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,520
anything we can do to make our virtual

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,680
interactions richer

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,839
and deeper and more meaningful is a good

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,520
investment of our time and technology

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,200
um you know i'm a sci-fi gig so you know

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,680
i'm all about holodecks and sensory

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,599
gloves and other fanciful ideas for how

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,880
that might

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,359
progress in the future but just

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,880
even examples of like this conference

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,119
and things that we can do to make our

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,119
interactions with our clients better and

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,200
with our our remote team day to day

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,520
i think is going to improve us overall

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,560
and paid big dividends

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,240
um you know even if we were to wave a

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,200
magic wand tomorrow and make

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,640
all the pandemic go away that's still a

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,480
worthwhile investment for people that

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,640
have to be away from their families

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,000
for people that don't work in the office

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,520
for people that

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,200
you know need to stay connected in a

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
fast-paced world so i hope we continue

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,560
to work on on these tools that make them

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,680
better

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,119
thanks felicia ricardo

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah to uh jump off of felicia's sci-fi

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,800
point which i

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,720
i love um i'm actually i'm excited about

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,680
digital experiences evolving

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,960
away from screens um because i've found

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,280
for me personally like

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,240
being um you know sheltering in place i

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,240
have been using my

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,920
alexa speaker and like voice interfaces

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,440
so much more and i think it's because

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
like so much of my life is revolving

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,560
around the screen with

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,079
not just work but video calls like

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,800
felicia was saying that

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,000
it's nice to stay connected uh without a

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,400
screen in front of me

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,720
right like one one app i've been using

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,119
literally every day is uh the npr one

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,440
app

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,480
um which just does an awesome job with

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,920
that and

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,119
i was really excited to see here at

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
drupalcon that there was different

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,160
conversations

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,760
around um thinking about how to

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,119
structure content for that and

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,960
it's one of the things that makes me so

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,640
excited about you know being in the

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,240
drupal space as i i really think that

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,520
drupal as a content management system

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,680
has to leg up over

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,440
other technologies for solving that

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,880
structured data problem because it's

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,560
really the key to making sure that that

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,200
data is accessible

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,480
right by um by different people across

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,640
different devices

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,440
that can you know consume that content

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,440
in different ways

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,359
right on all right justin bring us home

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,800
um well ricardo and felicia i have bad

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,240
news i think josh might have won the

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
panel because he now has a trending

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,319
hashtag

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,839
show the puppy in the stage chat

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,319
definitely what he brought a puppy to

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,240
this fight you know so i can't talk that

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,920
um mine's a little mundane but my my

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,440
rant is not showing budgets in our in

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,599
website rfps

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,520
and might be controversial to the um

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,160
attendees here but i think that every

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,160
agency

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,440
has a different sort of point where

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,960
they're really good at sort of a

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
different kind of project or team or

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,920
approach

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,920
um and a budget is a really instantly

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,440
quick way for an agency to know yeah i

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,720
can do a great job at that price point

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,000
or no i can't do a great job in that

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,640
price but whether it's too high or too

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,040
low

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,839
um and i and i uh i just i get

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,440
frustrated that

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,200
you know brands don't want to put that

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,640
in the rfp because i think ultimately

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,680
they'll get better bids because they'll

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,359
get bids around

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,880
the budget that they have and then

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,400
they'll be able to choose from

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,440
you know ones they can all afford as

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,240
opposed to getting a pitch they might

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,599
fall in love with when they see the

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,040
price tag and they're like oh man

00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,280
i can't do that that's mine all right

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,280
all right excellent uh well i have to

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,800
say this is this is on me we got caught

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,560
up and we had a little too much fun with

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,079
uh with this panel we really didn't

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,760
leave too much time for

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,839
audience questions so maybe with the

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,599
last 30 seconds i just want to make sure

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,520
folks know the best way to get in touch

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,280
with each of you guys and your teams

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,720
so uh josh if you just want to go first

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,800
