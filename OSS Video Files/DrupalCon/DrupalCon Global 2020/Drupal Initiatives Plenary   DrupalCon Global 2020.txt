00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,120
on day two of this event it's wonderful

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,000
to have you all here again for the

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,280

of the first ever virtual drupalcon

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760

we at the drupal association

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,880
decided to convert to a virtual event

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
we weren't really sure at all how it

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
would be received how it would go

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
but i think yesterday proved that it's

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
been a fantastic success

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,360

have to tell you that my absolute

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
favorite although i run into many many

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
drupal

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
uh applications with drupal sites all

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
around the world and organizations that

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
use drupal i'll personally i'll share my

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
absolute favorite

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
is the work that is being done by boston

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,440
children's hospital and

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,360
their drupal application actually is a

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
training tool that saves

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
many lives of children all around the

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
world and i'm super proud of that and

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,840
that probably is my my personally my

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
absolute favorite

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
every day i get to work with great

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,600

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
and one of the folks

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,000
also is gabor and gabor is i'm going to

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199

initiatives panel

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
and i do have to say that gabor

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
internally is one of my go-to folks for

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,199
drupal and i've known him a very long

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
time

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,680
and really he is a great voice for

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,680
drupal in the community within aquia

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
and so it's my pleasure to turn it over

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,520
to gabor

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
thank you lynn um hi everyone this is

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,240
gaber hoichi from acquia

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,160
and i am not the star of this show um

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,880
i've been the organizer

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
of this initiative leeds plenary and the

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
one before in amsterdam but the idea

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,080
actually comes from angie byron

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,360
uh because we are seeing a lot of

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
inspiring

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
and thought uh thought provoking content

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
from dries

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,160
that's kind of the stage of the future

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,919
of drupal

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
and it's been amazing to see the

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
comments in the chat and how people

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
reacted to that

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,919
but there's also all of these

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
initiatives with their actual leaders

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,759
that are people that are

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,000
are worth to get to know and there's no

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,479
space in the greece note for that

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
and i think it's very important for us

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
to meet these people face to face and

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,039
see what they are working on what their

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
struggles are

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,440
what their goals are how they are

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,280
getting things done so in this session

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,720
you get a broad level overview of how

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,039
how drupal operates what the initiatives

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
are

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,600
what some of the key initiatives are

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
obviously we don't have space for all

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
the initiatives in this session either

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
but we are trying to fill in the gap so

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,639
you know a lot more about what's going

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,000
on in drupal

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,240
and maybe you get to

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
you get to have some ideas for

organizers from around the globe

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199

best practices

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,440
um and these these

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:43,519
events can really be

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,519

and really our mission is to just

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
support

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,839
community-led teams to grow through

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
local events and if you're an event

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,480
organizer of any sort

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
whether it's again camps summits

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,200
training days

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,640
meetups you're more than welcome to

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
participate

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
so our vision you know during this time

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
of uncertainty um

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
you know existing organizers can can

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,560
basically receive

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
help from other organizers uh prime

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,360
example um avi

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
schwab from mid camp he has advised more

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
than a half dozen

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,860
other camps in regards to going online

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
so why should we care um

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,000
[Music]

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,760
come for the software stay for the

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
community we've heard this talked about

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
a lot

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
um and really in dries words it's really

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
the community and not

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,080
so much the software that that makes the

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
drupal project what it is

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
um drupal's humans in in synchronous

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,519
conversations

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,880
you know it just builds deeper

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,600
connections between between people

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,279
um so yeah it's critical it's critical

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
for us to continue building

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,720
the community because you can only get

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,800
so far

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,240
uh face-to-face so

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
what are some of the so why drupal

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
events

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,720
you know um well first

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
on board i wish i could see everybody

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
out there but i would ask you all to

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,680
raise your hands

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,480
if a drupal camp was the first

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,160
experience that you've had with drupal

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
for many clients it's the first

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,959
experience for many

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,560
um end users i know for me it was my

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
first experience i remember dave terry

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
was running drupal camp atlanta and that

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,680
was my first

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,120
experience also relationships

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,519
relationships are critical

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
you can only build so many relationships

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,839
virtual i know we're all web developers

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
but

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
um to really further on those

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,640
relationships to build

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,120
um meaningful relationships it's it's

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
really

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
um critical to get to meet people face

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
to face

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,079
also marketing um you know

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
can you imagine how many we have well

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,399
over 100 events

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
globally i believe um there's a lot of

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
marketing

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
that happens um for the drupal soft for

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,240
the drupal project

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,880

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
in november of 2018 we had our first

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,200
call

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,560
moved to 2019 we the drupal association

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
and rachel helped

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,320
set up a round table of drupalcon

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
seattle

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,000
then after that we decided to submit a

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
charter to dries and the drupal

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
association

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
and last year at drupalcon amsterdam we

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,959
were officially announced as

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,959
an official working group um and just

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,240
yesterday we've elected our final two

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,680
board members so

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,160
you know there was a little bit of time

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
that that that slowed us down due to

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,839
um you know where the world is today but

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
we are moving along

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,959
so what have we been working on this

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,279
awesome

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,120
events database this is something that

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,720
we're very very excited about

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
um it's a central location for

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
statistics so if you have an event

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
please

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,760
go there submit your previous events

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
submit your upcoming events

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
um we're trying to build a central

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
location so that we can have

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,279
very powerful data just imagine could

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,560
you imagine if we could say

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,639
x number of people attended drupal

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
volunteer led drupal events i think

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
that's a very powerful thing

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
and we're really looking forward to it

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
we also have the

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,839
website starter kit that we're kind of

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
working on we're in the very beginning

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,920
phases um

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,760
kudos to jd and and the team from um

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
drupal europe who have kind of submitted

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,040
some of their drupal 8 code but

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,959
we're really hoping to kind of work on

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,920
this next um so that

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,200
drupal camp organizers don't have to um

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,680
you know spin up new sites

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
every single time so like i mentioned

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,440

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
diversity you can find me everywhere on

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,399
the internet at sparklingrobots and i'm

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,920
speaking to you today from tawa lands in

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,880
albuquerque new mexico

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,399
and today is my birthday and i mentioned

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
that because i am super excited it's the

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
best possible birthday present to be

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,800
able to

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,160
speak to you about something that

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,240
matters so much to me which is drupal

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,480
diversity and inclusion

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
we're an all-volunteer working group

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,639
founded in 2016

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,079
by nikki stevens we have a leadership

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,639
team of about six people and there are

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,160
over 745 people in our channel as of

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
this morning

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
and our goal is really to continue the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
conversation about diversity and

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,680
inclusion within drupal and to provide a

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
safe space

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
to discuss those issues within the

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,800
drupal community

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
and i went to the channel and i asked

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
the group what they wanted me to talk

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,800
about

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
and the answer was clear they wanted me

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,040
to talk about racism

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
systemic injustice power privilege and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
how to be a better ally

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,079
and i said yeah i'm sure five minutes

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,399
will cover it so let's just get right

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,320
down to it

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
before i get into the meat of the

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
presentation i want to talk a little bit

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
about current events

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
so you know black lives matter in the

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
wake of massive global protests against

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,079
police brutality and racial injustice

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,360
many of us want to take action and i

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,959
wanted to spend the next few minutes

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
with a few ideas for ways you can do

00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
that

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
a lot of these challenges are more

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,279
systemic rather than individual

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,320
and the great news is that you can start

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,920
here in drupal community

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
it's not just a pipeline problem in

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,480
drupal we actually have plenty of

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
marginalized people in our community

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
right now

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,880
um and a lot of people leave if they're

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,360
experiencing

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,199
unfair behavior or unwelcoming behavior

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
so i think we can do better and i'm here

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
with just a few

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
suggestions for how you can do that and

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
then at the end we'll talk about how you

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
can get involved specifically in triple

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
diversity

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,480
so first of all i want you to read the

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,440
code of conduct for drupalcon

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,680
and i want you to read the code of

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
conduct for every drupal event you go to

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
these documents outline the kinds of

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,160
behaviors that are accepted

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,880
and encouraged and the kinds of

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,399
behaviors that are not tolerated

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
they're really important and it really

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,320
helps you understand how we want to be

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,839
as a community together

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
once you're familiar with the code of

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
conduct consider becoming an official

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
code of conduct

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,120
contact and i challenge you to say that

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
three times fast

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
these folks are officially trained

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
through a program set up by the

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
community working group

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
to uphold the code of conduct in their

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,480
events

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
and to help us have that safe and

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,039
welcoming community for all

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,400
it's really an important role of course

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,919
you can also speak up

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
if you see someone saying something

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
inappropriate it's a little bit

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,799
different here of course in the virtual

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
space but it's just as important

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,319
make sure you're prepared to interrupt

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
harassment

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,160
speak up when you see a problem uh it

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
helps a lot if you can do that

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,319
helps the marginalized people in our

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,520
community not have to do it all the time

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,960
notice who is in the room and who isn't

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
it's a little weird because we're not in

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
a room right now but you think you can

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,200
still look at who's speaking the most

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
uh who's in meetings those kinds of

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
things notice who's getting invited and

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
who's not

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,360
and then once you start to see that kind

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
of information over and over again in

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,400
your

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,240
company or at drupal events start con

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,559
start sponsoring marginalized people you

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,640
know get people invites into the room

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,559
find leadership opportunities for people

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
who you think are marginalized in your

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
company or in drupal

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,840
it's really powerful work and it's a way

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
to share your power with others

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,000
and of course if you're an agency or

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,440
have any kind of hiring responsibility

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
at your company

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
fix your hiring process fix your

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
recruitment process look at pay gaps

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,120
these are really really important

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
changes you can make that will have a

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
material impact

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
on underrepresented people in your

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,679
company and most people can't do this

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
but if you have that lever of power

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,919
please use it make sure you're paying

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
equitably

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,039
make sure you're hiring fairly and of

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
course

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,960
we've probably been hearing a lot about

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
language lately changing from blacklist

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,160
to block list

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,919
changing the name of your branch stop

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
saying powwow when you make we

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,400
mean meeting it's pretty easy and it has

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
a big impact

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
last but not least i want to talk about

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
drupal diversity's offerings here at

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,039
drupalcon specifically

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,559
we have two more sessions of our

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
marginalized speaker training happening

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,760
today and tomorrow

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,039
these are designed for underrepresented

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,520
speakers to

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,440
work together make pitches write bios

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,880
your voice on stage so i hope you come

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,919
and get some good ideas for what what

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,919
you might want to talk about at your

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,799
next drupal event

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120

uh we are offering uh 200

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,120
of anti-racist books that you can win in

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,600
to talk about these issues to find

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,080

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,720
thursday join us in slack

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,600

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:55,120
thank you tara this is great so next up

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,080
is rain and she will talk about

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,080
accessibility

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,679
hello

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,600
take it away

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,559
hi everyone i hope you're having a great

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,159
drupalcon

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,159
i'm here to talk about the state of

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,720
drupal accessibility today

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
and how you can get involved i'm one of

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
three topic maintainers

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,039
along with andrew mcpherson and mike

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
gifford

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,400
what i really want to talk about is that

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,720
accessibility is absolutely essential

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,280
for

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,919
inclusion the drupal community values

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
everyone

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,320
and if we aren't accessible in our code

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,159
in our interface then we limit who can

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,360
contribute drupal or

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,280
sorry accessibility is also a law

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,200
in many countries around the world there

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,559
are certain standards that need to be

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,039
upheld in that in terms of accessibility

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,919
in order to use a code base

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,720
and drupal is really prominent in

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,039
education

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
and government which means that

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,640
accessibility

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
is it's one of these things that becomes

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,679
a risk or a liability if the system

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,880
itself is not accessible

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
not only that but if we're not

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,240
accessible we end up leaving people out

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,280
and we believe in bringing people in

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,400
and in good code so drupal itself as a

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,400
community and

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,720
as a platform is truly leading the way

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
we are doing a fairly good job overall

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,520
we have a very committed and diligent

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
community

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
and a lot of our initiatives are

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,679
considering accessibility right from the

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
very beginning

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,679
of the process which is fantastic but

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
we do still need to do better as a

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,559
community and

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,799
in our code as of about 20 minutes ago

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,799
there were still

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,799
526 open accessibility bugs

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,600
in drupal core and 100 of those

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,120
are blocked simply by the review and

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
tested by the community

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
part of the process so that last step to

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,440
have somebody go in and say yes

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,679
this is actually accessible so that it

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,080
can be moved into drupal core

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,559
this has a big impact in adoption of

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,559
drupal which is important to all of us

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,159
this quote here is from carolyn boyden

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,720
and from uc berkeley

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,520
and it's far too big to really read in

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,919
this 20

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,039
20 second uh process but what's

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
important here is

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,360
before we make the leap our platform dev

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,280
team needs to make sure that any new

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,320
version not only maintains

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,240
but improves accessibility so

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,240
we need to think about that quote from

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
carolyn as we're thinking about

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,840
everything that we do

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,720
with drupal and as we're thinking about

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,760
maintaining

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
our code in the long run we need you to

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
be an accessibility champion in order to

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,559
make this happen

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,520
three of us truly isn't enough and

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,280
here i've put in a couple of pictures of

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,159
additional individuals who've really

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,120
made an impact

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,600
in accessibility of drupal core but you

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,120
can

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,840
also join this process and be part of it

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,400
and some of the ways that you can do

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
that

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,360
well first of all we need you at every

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,400
skill level if you're a beginner that's

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,640
fantastic

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,480
please don't belittle what you can

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
contribute as a beginner

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,480
the ways that you can contribute you can

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
document your experiences

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,559
and frustrations and challenges

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
sometimes the only thing that's needed

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,159
for somebody to come in and fix an

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,039
accessibility bug

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,880
is more clarity on why it's actually a

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,320
challenge and what's going on for that

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,559
individual

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
you can test patches when they come out

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,640
you can be that person who

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,880
review who puts in that rtbc reviewed

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,120
and tested by the community

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,120
moment in the issue queue to say yes

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,919
this does actually work

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,360
you can also tab around or run automated

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,120
testing and then document your

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,720
experiences there

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,039
also sometimes all we need are

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,600
screenshots or video recordings in order

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,559
to be able to take the next step

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,000
again you can do this at any skill level

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,159
you don't need to be an expert

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
another way that you can be part of this

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,279
process is simply throw away your mouse

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
for a day

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:16,080
once a week or once a month doing this

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,039
will enable you to experience the your

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,960
interfaces with an accessibility

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
challenge that is extremely common and

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,559
can have a big impact

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,320
and when i say throw away your mouse the

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,320
thing is that it's very easy for us to

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,279
subconsciously just move over and pick

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,120
up our mouse so

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
literally give it to your child or your

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,000
cat or do something so that you won't

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,400
pick it up

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,520
and use it and try to use your interface

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,919
without it

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,440
you can also install some extensions

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,120
that are very helpful one that i really

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,440
love is no coffee

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,600
the no coffee extension will simulate

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,480
the experiences of different types of

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
vision

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,520
degeneration or vision loss and also

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,640
various types of color blindness

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,279
so you can simply use this extension to

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
look at the interface and experience it

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,120
and see what kinds of challenges you

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
encounter and then you can file

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,720
bugs or add to issues based on what you

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,960
find

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,799
when you actually file a bug or add to

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,840
the issue queue the kinds of things that

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,279
will really help

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,279
us are the problem that you had

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,720
the context of that problem what were

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,720
you actually using

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,960
um tell us a little bit about yourself

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,799
and why that was a challenge

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,120
also give us some information on how to

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,559
reproduce the problem and if possible or

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,080
applicable give us some kind of a

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,520
screenshot or recording

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,000
and if you're not really sure what's

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,600
useful just ask we do have a slack

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,840
channel and we are available

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,039
and there's a good community that can

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
participate and give you some

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,400
information

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,679
another really concrete way that you can

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
get involved is to

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,120
choose an initiative or module that

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,039
you'd like to be the accessibility

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,400
champion for

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,480
pick something that you really care

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,799
about and see it through

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,520
engage with us as the maintainers ask

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,640
questions

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,200
and help that modular initiative really

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
get accessibility momentum mike is

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,039
talking a lot about olivero

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,480
at this drupalcon and he is an

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,480
accessibility champion for

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
oliveiro

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
can also get involved by joining our

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,559
accessibility bug bash

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,799
we do have a contribution table in the

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
contribution space and we will have some

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,480
working hours as well as a couple

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,640
of boss birds of a feather

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
remember that we do still have a number

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,120
of bugs that can be looked at

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
and andrew mcpherson did go through and

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
tag

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
a number of issues in the issue queue

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,159
for drupalcon global

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,240
so come to the table help us out and

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,840
maybe we can knock out some of these

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,480
bugs before the end of drupalcon

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,480
we also have regular office hours on the

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,760
third thursday of each month

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
we're still trying to figure out the

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,080
best time for these office hours to be

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,880
as inclusive globally as possible

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,880
but right now they are at 5 30 p.m

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,799
pacific time on the third thursday of

why are we here today so thank you

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,960
everybody so uh we've actually reached

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,919
several goals over

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
the past years uh like becoming an

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
initiative

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,480
joining several initiatives together the

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,679
main one has been

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,640
uh reaching beta and uh for clatto

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,960
and having clatto in core and we are

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,760
aiming to have claros stable

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,679
for the next drupal release uh the core

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,399
release 9.1

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,440
so that's our goal but what's the

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,720
initiative

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,880
actually the initiative is

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,120
it actually started with because several

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,919
group of people wanted to improve drupal

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,320
core

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,480
uh we're talking about javascript

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,600
modernizations

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,640
uh we were talking also about uh

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,760
usability modernizations and also

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
on a design perspective changing the

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,679
user interface

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,440
and actually claro is that piece claro

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,039
is the piece that actually

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,640
uh it's the the piece between this new

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,039
redesign the new drupal design system

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
that

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,279
actually uh became the or

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
it aims to be the new admin theme by

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,120
default for

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,720
drupal core but actually what's claudio

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,200
claro is actually uh

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,159
a clone of seven so we didn't actually

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,679
start from scratch we wanted to be sure

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,559
that we weren't losing all the work that

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,799
was made for

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
seven and all these the stability

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,840
stability that came with that

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,919
so we started uh replacing

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,440
component by component uh as you can see

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,760
it really looks uh super similar to

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,080
seven but it's actually a redesign of

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,159
that and we

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,520
started replacing all the components and

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,080
after that we started iterating uh

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,799
after each component so we've been kind

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,240
of

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,320
iterating over several things and after

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,760
getting a lot of feedback from several

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,159
people especially

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,200
it was really useful the feedback i

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,840
received

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,320
from the accessibility team for example

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,640
we can see here the focus of styles

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,520
that the initial design was something

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,080
and the

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,559
final design ended up being super

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,919
different so it was a huge improvement

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:57,200
on the design side we also um

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,320
took a an approach where we were kind of

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,799
collaborating

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,360
asynchronously we actually work with

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,159
sigma

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,120
which is a new design tool that it will

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,760
be basically

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,000
like a google docs for designers and

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,039
actually helped a lot on this process

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,320
and

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,279
was actually a huge piece for that also

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,760
we've all

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,240
we've taken on into a corner that over

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,200
the years that we can't break people's

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
drupal

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
uh we need to have in mind all the time

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,200
the

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,120
backwards compatibility because this is

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,679
going to be an admin theme

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
and it's going to be really important to

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,919
uh

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,640
respect people's uh configurations and

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
and everything so we really have that in

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
mind

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,440
we also need you uh we have

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,080
right now claro as a beta into drupal

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,000
core so

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,440
please enable that and please test claro

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,120
and file as many

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,799
bags as you can so we can get to

00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,000
stable with the fewer bags possible so

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,880
we need the community to test glado

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and what's next for for claro for for

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,120
the initiative

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,679
after reaching this stable uh point

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,440
so we want to go beyond the components

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,120
we want to start thinking

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,880
on regions for example we want to

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,399
start thinking on other things that we

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,679
can change for example

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,799
uh we are thinking about creating

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,000
uh some groups or changing the layout

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,640
for example

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,960
we're try we're thinking about having

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,480
several visions available on the admin

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,200
interface so

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
we can actually customize uh properly

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,799
the

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,360
the interface and also we are thinking

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,240
about

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,519
uh having an independent style guide uh

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,919
public to

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
everybody for this new drupal design

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,600
system

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,360
so it can be used on several places

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,559
we're also thinking about

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,720
uh having site theme customizations but

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,200
also user customizations for example

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
having

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,960
um an accent color that can be

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,360
customized or that the user can actually

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,519
activate the dark mode or the high

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,000
contrast mode or something like that and

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,480
we also

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,679
want to redesign parts of drupal like

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,120
the builds ui

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,600
or maybe other ones we actually have to

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,120
talk and plan about that so

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,320
please join us uh we you can find us on

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,480
the admin ui

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,159
or the amin ui design channels on the

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,760
drupal slack or also you can join the

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,799
global contributions groups

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,000
we created the one for clatto where we

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,200
created several events so please join us

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,760

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,679
promo drupal initiative

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,720
hi suzanne it's all yours

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,960
great to be here um so my name is

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,320
suzanne dargacheva and i'm here today to

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,359
talk to you about the promote drupal

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
initiative

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,399
um it's an initiative that started a

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,079
couple years ago to help

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,440
people in the drupal community really

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,320
come together to promote drupal

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
and since then there have been many

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,679
translators

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,320
marketers content writers developers

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,079
really everyone from the community

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
coming together to contribute in

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,599
different ways

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,240
and a lot of these folks were already

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,280
working to promote drupal in their own

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,320
local areas or in their own way um and

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
this initiative

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,480
is great because it provides us a way to

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,599
really collaborate together

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
and collaborate with the drupal

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,079
association as well

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,639
um so the goal of promote drupal is

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,879
mostly

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,480
outward facing which i think is

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,599
something we're often missing in the

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,359
drupal community

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,560
um we really want to spread the word

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,480
about drupal outside of the community

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,320
we all know that drupal is an amazing

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,240
platform because we were here yesterday

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,160
at the dries note we know it's

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,400
innovative we know it's exciting

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,000
um so promote drupal is here to help us

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
tell those stories

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
um to other audiences and to really get

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,680
those messages

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,920
out um and kind of position them more

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,599
outside our community so some recent

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,640
updates one thing you've all

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,000
probably noticed uh just before the

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,640
launch of drupal 9

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
drupal has a new logo called an

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,480
evergreen logo

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,400
and the goal of creating this new logo

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,480
was to help us

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
we'll first just re-energize the brand

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,680
but also to de-emphasize the change in

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,000
version

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,880
because before we are often using that

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,839
um eight

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,480
drop logo that you are all used to um

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,079
and this

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,079
can help us reduce anxiety about

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,359
upgrading from one version of drupal to

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
another

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,119
uh so behind that that logo there's

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,240
actually a whole brand

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,720
uh there's a brand uh book that you can

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,480
use to develop your own marketing

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,480
materials around drupal

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
and that includes things like typography

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,880
and colors and

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,560
image choices and and things like that

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
so if you're selling drupal to new

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,440
audiences or communities

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,520
um that can really be helpful

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,119
um this brand has been used to create

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,280
lots of materials already

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,640
so there's already kind of a base of

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,200
marketing materials that you can use

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,520
there's a one pager about drupal 9 that

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,320
a designer on my team developed in just

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,359
a few hours

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,760
and i think the brand book really helps

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,839
with

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,040
those kind of initiatives because it

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,160
already answers a lot of

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,680
designers questions about um

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,160
what they should be creating what they

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,400
should be designing

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,680
there's also a landing page on drupal 9

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
that some of you might have

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,720
been using to spread the word about

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,440
about

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,920
the benefits of drupal 9 what's new to

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,640
kind of help communicate that

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,760
you might also be referencing that as a

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,000
new user

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
and there's actually a work underway in

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
the community to help

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,839
translate that page

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,680
um we're also putting together marketing

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,680
materials

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,720
to use at conferences outside of the

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,200
drupal bubble

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,320
so while drupalcon is going on this week

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,160
and

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,520
drupal's obviously very present here

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,880
drupal is actually also being

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,680
represented at another virtual

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,320
conference

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,440
about digital marketing uh for higher

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,760
education

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,240
um so there's materials being developed

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,800
that you can use to represent drupal at

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,800
other conferences as well that's

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,240
something we want to do more of

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
you might have already heard about the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,240
drupal pitch deck project

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,040
this is a deck a set of

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,880
google slides that you can use to pitch

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,520
drupal to new audiences

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,040
and uh there's actually over 100 case

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,520
studies as well as

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
some talking points about why drupal's

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,680
so great and

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,119
what the benefits are um and

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,200
this pitch deck has already been

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
translated into many languages

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
there's work underway to make it easier

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
to export

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,040
so that you can easily just grab the

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
slides in the language of your choice

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,920
so beyond all these efforts to promote

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,400
drupal

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,200
outside the community to new audiences

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,079
uh there's

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,400
a a great project that went along with

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,880
the launch of drupal 9 celebrate drupal

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
uh dan lemon put together this website

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,839
celebrate drupal.org

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,119
and i think it's also important to keep

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,920
the brand alive

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,760
within the community and you can

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,440
continue going to this site actually

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,560
even though drupal 9's already launched

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,680
and continue to add

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,359
images and videos and tell stories there

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,359
so i think that's exciting that we have

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,119
that that project

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,720
um for us to use so there's many ways to

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,920
get involved like you'll hear with all

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,240
the initiatives um

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
we're really eager to to help you

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,359
contribute

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,280
um in this initiative we're looking for

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,240
marketers and content editors

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,560
translators agency leaders it's a great

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,599
way to make a non-code contribution so

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,320
if you know that

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,640
you want to get involved and you know

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,119
even a little bit about the the drupal

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,760
the drupal brand we'd love to get your

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,160
input

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,320
and it's also a great way for newcomers

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,359
to get involved because we really value

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,839
outside opinions

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,440
a couple examples of that we have some

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,480
new projects that we're

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,000
just starting um there's a

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,520
evaluator um uh sorry uh a survey that

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,520
we want to send out to

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,599
evaluators uh that we're putting

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,040
together so you can get involved in

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,640
helping us do that

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,000
and we want to also conduct some

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,200
interviews as part of this project

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,320
and another new initiative

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,119
is to create a marketing calendar that

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,640
we can use

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,800
to kind of join efforts between the

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,079
the drupal association and the community

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,119
and just help you

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,640
spread those great stories in your local

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,240
area

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,800
so that's another project that we need

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,400
help with and there's some issues there

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,160
already but if you want to get

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,359
in i know it can be intimidating as a

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,200
newcomer

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:26,640

that this pandemic wasn't happening so

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,520
we could do all types of hugs but it's

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,400
not just

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,040
us either we have a whole team of people

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,839
helping us

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,680
and contributors um and this is kind of

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,520
just like a subset of them in addition

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,680
to all the people who actually got

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,520
who are committers there there's people

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,560
reviewing patches there's people

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,680
creating issues there's people um

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,040
working on stuff and commenting and

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,359
without these people we would be dead

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,560
and

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,000
stuck in the mud so if if you're

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,400
if you're any of these people please pet

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,400
yourself and yeah so thank you so much

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,880
um last year the drupal community

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
mourned the passing of rachel oliveira

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,920
and we've named

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,839
this new theme in her honor rachel

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,440
touched many people in both the drupal

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,359
and accessibility communities

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,119
we chose the name oliveiro not just

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,079
because we have made accessibility a top

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,079
priority

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,520
but because we aspire to develop this

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,200
theme in a manner that is consistent

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,480
with the qualities that rachel embodied

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,800
including patience

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,800
generosity and inclusivity

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,800
this is what it looks like hey it's it's

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,400
gorgeous it's beautiful look we have

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,839
drop down menus

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,599
we have an option for an always on

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,760
mobile navigation

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,760
if you have too many menu items the site

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,400
branding area in the top left

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,359
can change colors the background can be

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,119
gray or white

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,359
to accommodate whatever you can kind of

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,680
make this theme your own

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,119
and yeah there's a lot of really cool

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,040
things in here

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,560
and how did we get here you know it

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,480
needs to look modern it needs to look

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,160
friendly we don't control the content

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,000
and we don't control the content types

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,079
we don't really control anything

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,839
and on top of that the community is

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,040
somewhat opinionated and yes i am

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,800
talking to you

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,280
um so uh how did we get here well

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,920
we identified some stakeholders of you

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,079
know who this

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,040
who this couldn't happen without and we

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,400
sent a uh

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,720
we sent a poll to them where they could

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,560
choose between adjectives such as

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,040
formal or casual or friendly or

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,119
professional novel conservative

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,560
and we had each of our stakeholders kind

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,119
of just put their little dots and some

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,040
comments

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,880
on each of these so we kind of knew we

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,480
were where we were going

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,319
with the design of this theme

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,079
and so we came up with a couple options

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,480
we came up with three options ranging

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,359
from more traditional to more modern

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,960
and the option that was chosen was

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,280
number two

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,400
and then it was kind of off to the races

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,440
and we started working

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,119
uh in figma and iterating and going

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,040
through and making changes

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,359
and making sure we could accommodate

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,040
different things

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,800
and so at that point we have to start

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,119
development oh no

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,160
so we have so many technical challenges

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,240
in front of us

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,079
like we have to handle everything thrown

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,599
at us just random blocks we need to make

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,440
it look good we have to balance modern

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,599
technologies and older browsers

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,640
accessibility is a huge priority there's

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,319
all types of

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,839
coding requirements for core we can't

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,960
just throw in like later

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,800
my javascript you know and then ie 11.

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
ie11 has proven to be much more of a

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,920
drag

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,920
than i thought it would be um but yeah

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,160
and i want to give a huge shout out to

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,040
the teams from claro and umami

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,880
uh without their prior contributions

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
which we built on top of we would be

00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,760
stuck in the mud they fought some

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,119
battles for us

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,040
that they didn't even know at the time

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,160
like things like getting fonts

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,079
you know web fonts and post css

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,280
and if you if you contributed to these

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,560
thank you so much

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,319
um i really appreciate you

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,839
um so where are we at right now we're

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,200
we're in kind of the final stages of

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,040
alpha right now

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,440
we're concentrating on stabilizing

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,839
regions and fixing bugs

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,680
and um but it actually like looks good

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,760
and it works good there's actually some

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,760
like sites that are live out there right

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,119
now and i want you to use it

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,680
um it's drupal.org project slash

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,880
oliveiro it's looking pretty good so

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,240
we're trying to get into core

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,599
right so how is that going to happen

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,480
well we're going to have a beta stage

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,920
and we're going to focus on

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,560
accessibility testing

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,000
code quality and edge case bugs in a

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,720
little over a month we actually want to

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,119
get that

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,640
uh we actually want to get that patch

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,440
included in there and then

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,119
9.1 comes out in december you know it'll

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,160
probably be included as experimental or

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,480
something like that

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,240
but after that we need to make it stable

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,720
and we want it to become the default

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,160
theme hopefully in drupal 9.2

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,520
we want to figure out some of the same

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,920
problems that clara was figuring out

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,640
like including dark mode color switching

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,720
and who knows what's after that there's

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,839
lots of really cool options that this is

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
opening up

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,520
you can try this now you are in front of

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,359
your computer go to lb dot cm slash

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,160
oliveiro that will actually

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,640
pull up a drupal-powered website i think

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,520
it's running 8-8 right now uh with aloe

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,920
vera in there

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,599
um it's a it redirects you to a url

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,359
that's powered by tugboat which is like

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,920
i am so thankful for it it's

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,480

mentoring our new contributors

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,559

i'm ellie i do some leadership and

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,079
organizing activities with the drupal

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,040
core mentoring group

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,720
drupal core mentoring is a group of

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,520
mentors and organizers

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,920
who help regular people become

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,760
contributors to the drupal project

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,280
i've been doing this for a few years now

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,319
since around dribble con

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,720
austin when my mentors

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,920
overrode my own imposter syndrome to get

00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,920
me to be a mentor

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,680
so um drupal core mentoring got started

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,520
back in 2012

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,599
this is the classic picture of tim

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,000
plunkett with the mohawk i have

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,680
uh i'm open to suggestions for new

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,160
vintage drupal contribution

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,960
photos such as this so please send them

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,559
my way

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,640
but everything started when xjm

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,720
suggested core office day at dribble con

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,440
denver after the success of core office

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,520
hours

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,200
in 2011. and today we have

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,640
usually about 30 mentors at every

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,400
dribble con this is the group from

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,319
amsterdam last fall

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,880
and we've grown mentored contribution

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:38,240
participation from under 100 people to

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,839
over 250 new contributors at drupalcon's

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,119
worldwide which is pretty nifty

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,119
so why would you contribute as a drupal

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,599
user

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,760
however you may use it as an editor or

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,760
designer or

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,079
um programmer code person what not

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,040
uh you can share your specific skill set

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,200
with others who don't

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,280
have that skill set and by combining all

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,400
our unique expertise we can really build

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,720
a product that will

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,559
make work way better for everybody as

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,720
well as developing a community that is

00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,920
really healthy and robust for everybody

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,680
in it

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,160
um why mentor these folks are a couple

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,520
of

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,520
my mentors rachel and joelle mentors are

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,319
also experienced in a variety of skill

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,319
sets

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,839
um all the things i mentioned before but

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,280
some of us are good at organizing and

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,920
running meetings that would be

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,440
me and others are really expert at

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,359
navigating the drupal issue queue

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,440
knowing where to find anything and

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,839
knowing how to help you help yourself

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,839
it's the old teaching you how to fish

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,680
thing

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,880
but the cool thing about mentoring is

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,800
that it builds

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,440
so you mentor new contributors they

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,599
mentor each other mentors mentor men

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,520
mentors mentor mentors i think that's

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,680
right um

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,400
and everybody learns and grows

00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,920
so for drupalcons we usually have a lot

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
of planning in advance and get

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,880
everything set up we have

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
first time contributors workshop in

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,680
person we do mentor orientations and

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,040
triage

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,200
and on the mentored contribution day

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,280
actually sit folks down at tables based

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,880
on interest and topic area

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,599
and what you might need help with or

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,599
want to work on

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,280
we've also done plenty of virtual

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,319
mentoring in the past

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,960
so this isn't totally new to us

00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,839
as mentors um when i got started it was

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,520
entirely in

00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,640
irc which was a little while ago

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,440
um and we've done a lot of other virtual

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,640
events like

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,359
um drupal global contribution weekend

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,480
and a lot of trainings and the speaker

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:45,040
diversity workshops

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,480
and just all kinds of stuff already

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,839
happens online

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,280
so this year in the last like two months

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,040
we had to figure out how to merge

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,160
everything to do drupalcon

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,079
global correctly so we needed

00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,920
a space where people could gather for

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,359
free outside of the hop-in platform

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,119
because contribution space has always

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,760
been free and open for anybody to drop

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,200
into

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,520
whether they had a drupalcon ticket or

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,079
not and we needed a way to gather people

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,160
to

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,359
tables and put them in touch with others

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,359
working on the same topics

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,160
you might be wondering exactly where you

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,760
personally should start

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,040
and for that we have this hindi

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,559
flowchart it's actually on the

00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,040
events.drupal.org website for drupalcon

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,440
global

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,880
under program contribution events so you

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,240
can take a look at this and think about

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,400
where you want to

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:39,760
go on friday or during the week

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,040
for anything though any uh mentoring or

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,040
contributing you're going to go to

00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,640
contrib2020.getopensocial.net

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,559
and that is our contribution space you

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
just sign up create an account

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,079
join some groups and then in each group

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,359
you can join events

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,960
uh the groups all have different topics

00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,280
so it's a group instead of a table

00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,839
that's the sort of one to one

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,119
there um and the group leads will add

00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,040
events four different mentored

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,079
contribution times and whatever else may

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,720
need to be done

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,119
and specify where it will happen so this

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,640
is

00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,400
uh the group i think we've actually

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,760
changed the names since i made this

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,280
slide it's now called mentored

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,119
contribution

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,359
um so first-time contributors and

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,880
mentors please join this group

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:26,079
i'm pointing up the slides above me i

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,119
don't know where it is for you um

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,480

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,640
they're going to meet from mostly b and

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,640

mentoring channel on drupal slack

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,480
you can see the threads from our mentor

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,079

this drupalcon we have a virtual booth

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,800
which doesn't actually have a hologram

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,440
in it that's not how virtual mentoring

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,599
works

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,839
just to be clear but uh my commercial

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,720
very helpfully contributed this to the

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,559
presentation um

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,000
virtual mentoring will be a little more

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,520
text based and a little less

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,079
interactive than a hologram

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,359

and how we moved forward

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,720

01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,079
so let's start

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,960
have you ever seen it it was 20 years

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,599
ago

01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,160
the first logo appeared even before the

01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,720
first

01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,480
official release of trooper the logo was

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:40,160
created by dre's nephew

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:43,599
whom is shared the dorm with

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,520
you know at the time drupal was named

01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:49,520
drop due to that funny story when dries

01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,319
wanted to register the domain name

01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,960
darpa which means village community in

01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,079
dutch but

01:02:52,960 --> 01:03:01,280
um he mistyped darp

01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:02,799
as drop and so drop.org was launched

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,880
then after some months a new version

01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:08,960
appeared now the black drop is placed

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,240
inside the drop type but it was one year

01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,160
later

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,480
then the first drupal conversion

01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,599
appeared the idea of christian johnson

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,000
aka kika

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,480
was to put two drops sideways together

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,720
to form an infinity symbol

01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,160
when placed it inside a filled circle it

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,799
reassembled the phase

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,920
after more work by stephen witness aka

01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,960
unicode

01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:33,599
the druplicon was created a stylus drop

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,160
with the infinity eye a round nose and a

01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,160
miscue

01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:41,200
smile and then after four years

01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,839
the 3d druplicon as we know it appeared

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,640
in the drupal codebase yes i put all the

01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,599
red souls

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,200
with the gift comment that you can see

01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,880
if you are very nervous me

01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,760
anyway it was 2008 when a big change of

01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,760
payment

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,880
drupal needed a wall mark and mark

01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,039
burton created

01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,559
a drupal wall mark while working on the

01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:05,440
drupal.org redesign project

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,160
and then years later when drupal 8 was

01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,039
released

01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,200
a stylish drop emerged to represent the

01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,960
new version of the software

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,280
with the cutout of an eight instead of

01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,920
drop the log is simpler and slicker than

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,559
the drupalcon it has been used in pitch

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,559
decks

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,839
and product comparison and having a more

01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,760
mature logo

01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,359
allowed us to visualize visually

01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,200
represent the modernization

01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:31,599
in the underlying technology of drupal

01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,480
but then what we had a fantastic

01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,720
druplicon

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,400
but not a true logo the drop icon is a

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,240
well-loved community symbol

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,520
a character that has been adopted a

01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,079
thousand different ways

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,880
in a typical open source fashion just

01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,640
like drupal itself

01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,319
if you ever attended a drupal event you

01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,799
have seen variation of this original

01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,960
drop

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,960
i thought loved by true colors it's a

01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,440
bit of curiosity towards others and

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,440
probably

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,200
two grassroots for marketers and digital

01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,240
directors trying to select a solution

01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,280
for their next

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,880
ambitious project

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:07,440
so what to do for the upcoming drupal 9

01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,440
release

01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,760
with the release of drupal 9 as you know

01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,280
the drupal project would have realized

01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,680
the vision of transforming

01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,000
its development process instead of each

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,119
major version of drupal such as version

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,359
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,119
required platforming from end user

01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,359
drupal has become a never

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,000
green software platform that receives

01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:30,960
continual innovation and other updates

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,520
so in early 2020 the drupal association

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
opened

01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,880
a call for designer to help creating a

01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,000
drupal logo

01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:41,760
reflecting this new evergreen philosophy

01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,760
and we six eleven

01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,559
uh sorry six eleven received the great

01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:50,000
privilege and responsibility to lead the

01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,920
process yes i interrupt myself

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,760
because from time to time i want to see

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,119
the chat but it's not easy when i

01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:00,400
speak anyway um

01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:03,680
so let's start we were so honored to

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,359
to have this opportunity and we

01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,240
really enjoyed working with the drupal

01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:10,280
association and through this process

01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,440
the requirements were very clear

01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,799
recognizability

01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,640
color accessibility and we worked on

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,760
several iterations creating various

01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,240
proposals based

01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,039
on the following concepts continuity

01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,880
evolution

01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:27,119
flexibility dynamism integration

01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,880
the goal was clear create a new

01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,760
evergreen logo independent from the

01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,559
version

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,760
many different new drops were designed

01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,920
and discuss it

01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,920
but all right sorry

01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,319
then the final solution came out as

01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,599
simple

01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:48,000
and limited as strong a kind of creative

01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,760
epiphany

01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,680
why create a new drop completely

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,400
different from the others

01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,240
marks of the drupal official ecosystem

01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,280
and increase the visual fragmentation of

01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,880
a brand

01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,680
that wants to strengthen over time

01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:07,039
conquering uniqueness and solidity

01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,039
we don't need another drop we need

01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,839
consistency

01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:28,580
[Music]

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,119
and there it is

01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:42,240
we also created an updated the drupal

01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,240
brand book to include all the guidelines

01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,720
such as all the possible variation with

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,440
background

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:53,039
and the logo with drupal warmup and

01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,039
alongside a version number

01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:00,079
and here you can see how the drupal logo

01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,079
appears in a product comparison

01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,960
finally a quick recap consistency

01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,839
has become the key value of the story

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
a unique sign to avoid visual

01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:12,720
fragmentation

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,880
is a clear reference that unites all the

01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,440
logos of the drupal universe

01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,640
drupal as software drupal association

01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,560
and drupalcon

01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,319
and we are very very proud to be the

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,960
agency that worked closely

01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,679
with the drupal association to realize

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,960
such a

01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,600
huge huge project so

01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,199
thank you we started with the music we

01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,920
told you a passion story

01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:38,159
let's go back to the music to greet you

01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,600
we do it with the evergreen song you

all these fields that we

01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:28,159
spent together designing the brain the

drupal brand identity so

01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,360
