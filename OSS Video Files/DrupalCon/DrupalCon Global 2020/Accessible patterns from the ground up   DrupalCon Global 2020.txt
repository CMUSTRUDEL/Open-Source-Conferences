if people are introducing people or not

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,279
but i'm here

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,399
so and it looks like a lot of us are

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,120
here so i'm going to go ahead and get

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,639
ready since

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,559
we are on the time so welcome everyone

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,000
to my talk accessible patterns from the

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,759
ground up

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
digital accessibility can be difficult

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
or frustrating to a lot of people

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
but it doesn't have to be by making some

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,840
small changes to your everyday workflow

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,760
you can make a huge impact on making the

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,439
digital world more inclusive

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
without crushing your creativity or

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
sacrificing your sanity

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,160
so in this talk i'll walk through the

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
process of creating an accessible

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,160
pattern from design to development

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,960
while focusing on accessibility best

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,480
practices and tools at each step

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,559
hi mike and i'll start with a wireframe

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,640
process that into design translate the

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,000
design into code and finally we'll test

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,079
for accessibility

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
obviously on your team if you have a

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,120
larger team you probably wouldn't be

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
doing all of these things

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
and you'd also be doing these things in

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
a lot more in-depth kind of way

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
but this is kind of the high level

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
overview so then you can take some of

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,680
these

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
tools and best practices and apply them

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,439
to your

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
situation

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
my name is carrie fisher i'm a senior

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
accessibility consultant at dq

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
i've been building websites

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,439
professionally since about

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,320
early 2000 give or take

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
with various frameworks in fact my first

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,759
real job

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,159
as a web developer was taking a website

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,159
from drupal 4 to drupal 6.

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
so i mean who knew who knows what

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,119
happened to 5 there

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
but no drupal experience prior to that

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,240
they just kind of threw me in the deep

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
end

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
it was a little bit challenging but it

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
also introduced me to the amazing

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
community

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
and i've kind of stuck around for a

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,520
while so i am thankful for that

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
difficult project

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
so essence that initial project with

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
your bull i've spent the majority of my

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,759
professional career working as a

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,640
front-end developer

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
at various drupal shops in particular

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
and then i kind of switched on

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,159
to more ux and accessibility which led

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
me to dq

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
um it may not be a name that you're

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
familiar with but it's very

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,239
big in the accessibility world so it's

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
one of the top companies in the world

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,000
specializing in digital accessibility

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,879
and we work with a lot of fortune 500

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,879
companies

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
we make websites mobile apps more

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,800
accessible

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
educational training resources audits

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
and a suite of tools

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
uh you may be me may be familiar with

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
axe core

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
one of our tools

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,879
a few a few of you know who dq is yeah

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
hi hi cat

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
so today we're going to talk about the

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
process of going from accessible pattern

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
idea to the final product and we'll chat

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
about the four stages as we go through

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
accessibility journey

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,840
and for me that i call it awareness

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
knowledge practice and understanding

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
and this talk was inspired by the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
variety of students i've trained in

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
accessibility

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
and addresses some of the typical

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
questions i get asked during these more

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
beginner trainings

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
um this is ta this talk is tagged as

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
intermediate because i'm going to go

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
through this first part a little bit

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
faster so we can get to more of the meat

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,440
of the pattern

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,360
but if there's anything that is

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
confusing or you want to know more about

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,800
you've got all the links now to get a

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
hold of me

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
and then obviously there's a lot of

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
really great people in the drupal

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,959
community that also specialize in

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
accessibility um

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
like i mentioned earlier one size does

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,159
not fit all based on your team's size

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
budgetary constraint

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,239
you may do one piece and then hand it

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
off to another team member or an outside

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,120
consultant

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
or you might need not need all the tools

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
or steps outlined

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
and that's okay it's more important to

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
find something that works for you

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
and your team than just giving up on

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,239
accessibility altogether

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,760
so this is this talk is meant to help

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,200
you get that initial internal

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,239
conversation going

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,680
all right so moving on uh this all has

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
kind of a growth

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,879
farmer kind of aspect to it as any good

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
farmer knows or gardner knows

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,280
before you plant any seeds you must prep

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
the soil so let's chat a bit about stage

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
one

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
which is accessibility awareness before

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
you can fix the problem you have to

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,959
realize there is a problem

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,799
so this is awareness right you're brand

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,560
new to digital accessibility

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,320
you're still trying to understand what

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
it is and how you can implement changes

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
in your daily workflow maybe

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,759
um or you may be aware that there's a

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,759
set of digitally accessibility

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
guidelines for developers and designers

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
out there but you're kind of hazy on

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
what it all kind of means in a more

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
practical

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
hands-on approach sense so again if

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
you're new to the field of accessibility

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
the following slides will help you give

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
you a deeper foundation before we go

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,680
into the pattern workflow

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
but if you're less new like some of us

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
here

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,520
you might know some of this already but

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,280
it's kind of important to just kind of

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,240
do this really quick review so we're all

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
on the same page

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
digital accessibility sometimes

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,320
abbreviated a11y

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
also called ally sometimes it's about

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
designing and building your digital

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
offerings

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
in such a way that regardless of a

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
person's mental or physical ability

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
they can still interact with your

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,080
website app or electronic document in a

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,840
meaningful and equal way

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
to the world health organization we

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
estimate about 1 billion

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
or 15 of the world's population

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
self-identify as having a disability

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
and of course that original number is i

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
think a little bit deceiving

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
because if you consider people who don't

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
identify as having a disability but who

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
could benefit from accessible websites

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
and apps

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,759
that number jumps way up higher for

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
example people who are temporarily

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,880
disabled

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
like a broken wrist or situationally

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,759
disabled

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
glare on a device screen i think we've

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,080
all been there at least

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
mildly disabled right some people who

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600
are considered disabled like hard of

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
hearing or maybe you're colorblind

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,080
but you would never check that box for

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
feeling like on a census like being

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
disabled

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
or even sing english as a second

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
language or whatever

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
content that you're reading that is your

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
not primary language

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
so you might need a little bit more time

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
to process the content

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
this one this part always reminds me of

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
helena

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
uh shout out to her but uh she's always

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,479
talking about like this

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,240
if you're talking about the us alone you

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
have 56.7 million

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
so she likes to talk about it as the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
entire population of california plus new

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
york together

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,800
and you'd never build like a website or

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
an app and say oh yeah

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
everyone can use this except for

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
california and new york and i feel like

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,319
that's so powerful because

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
you know it kind of puts a little bit

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,080
more tangent on

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,120
this huge number 56 million is kind of a

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
hard number to wrap your head around

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,199
but if we're talking about globally uh

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,520
39.6 people

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,759
uh 65 and older who could benefit from

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,240
accessible websites to loss of hearing

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
eyesight motor control decrease

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
cognition

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,440
and again this going into that kind of

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,919
state idea that would be equivalent to

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
texas plus illinois so about 38 million

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
there

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,400
of course this number is expected to

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
double in 20 years

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,599
as we keep getting older we're living

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
longer

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,080
and technology is becoming even more

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
prevalent and important our daily lives

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
my generation is one of the ones that

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,639
knew life before technology

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
had invaded it to the level it is now

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
and

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
will be probably some of the older

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,599
generation that's lived that kind of

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
gamut from nothing to everything so it's

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
kind of

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,240
a really interesting idea of how that

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,880
progresses as we age and user experience

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,720
and like how that really plays into it

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,039
so in total we're talking about 96

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,840
million or 32 percent of the population

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,360
we're talking only u.s here so if you're

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
ignoring this collective demographic

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
you're losing up to 32 percent of your

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
potential users

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
just by those simple numbers and a lot

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,479
of people understand those numbers but i

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
think this is a number that a lot of

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
people don't get to hear about but

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,039
people within the

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,599
people with disabilities in the us

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,680
control over 1 trillion dollars and have

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
over 200 billion to spend at

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
as they see fit like discretionary they

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
don't have to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
pay like the rent or utilities and that

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,160
sort of thing so

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
long story short if your company is

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
spending lots of money on things like

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,240
seo

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
marketing but not addressing

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
accessibility needs of their users

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,680
they're missing out on both the huge

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,680
numbers of users and their money

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,280
all right so those are rough numbers on

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
people could benefit from accessible

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
websites apps the money they can spend

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
but what about regulations related to

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,479
accessibility this one i'll kind of

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,639
gloss over about

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,560
but there is this thing called the web

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
content accessibility guidelines

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
um we i call it wike some people call it

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
wcag

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,479
we cag i've heard it all whatever you

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,479
call it

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
this these regulations have were

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
developed by the w3c

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
uh process in cooperation with

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
individuals and organizations around the

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,560
world

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
with the goal of providing single shared

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
standard web content accessibility

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
that meets the needs of individuals

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,600
organizations and governments

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,440
internationally these guidelines are

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
helpers right i think a lot of people

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
read these specs then

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,080
and really get into the nitty-gritty

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
which is great

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,839
but on a practical sense they're really

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
aids to help designers and developers

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,680
create accessible websites and apps with

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
people in mind

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
it gets technical really fast so for

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
beginners we try to focus on

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,000
the actionable parts of the guidelines

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,680
or the poor concepts

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
so we're talking about perceivable

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
operable understandable

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
and robust so if you hear the acronym

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
poor

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
um that's what that means and it's not

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
about

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
rigidly adhering to the hard and fast

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
rules like i just talked about with wcag

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
but it's about understanding and meeting

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
the needs of individuals

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
so i like this visual here that i

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
created here

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,600
to think about the interconnection of

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
these poor elements because again we

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
kind of see them

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,240
individual but they're really symbiotic

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
it's like a relationship

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,560
and so it's circular and you know kind

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
of each one feeds into the other

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
so a little bit quicker here the

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
category is poor perceivable

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,079
making sure that users can perceive the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
information being presented

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,160
so i might ask something like is our

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
website is there anything on our website

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
or app that a person with a disability

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,760
could not perceive

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,240
would this work for visual mobility

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,079
hearing cognitive speech right

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
so an example would be like adding text

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
alternatives to non-decorative

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
images or adding captions and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
transcripts to videos

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
making sure the color is not the only

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,040
method to convey meaning

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
those would be an kind of examples of

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
perceivable

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
the second category is operable so users

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
must be able to operate the interface

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
um so i'm asking questions like can the

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
users control the interactive elements

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
on our web

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,320
or app so a lot of times interactivity

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,279
might have to do with uh javascript a

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
lot of times

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,600
so i'm testing for things like keyboard

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
traps modals that sort of thing

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,120
so when i make i want to make sure that

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
using my keyboard only that

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,440
i can like i said go through a modal or

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
go through a slideshow

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
making sure i have enough time to fill

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,519
out a form and that sort of thing

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,240
so the third one is understandable you

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,880
want to make sure that

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,399
that things are understandable and the

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,240
information is

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,079
well written the operation it makes

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
sense right is the content our operation

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,560
cannot be beyond understanding

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
essentially

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,399
so i'm asking again questions about

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,440
content read written clearly

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,560
does the page order make sense um

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,800
so again why would i write something

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,240
that complex or an acronym but not

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
explain what it is

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
uh we want to make sure we do those kind

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
of things and also making sure that

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
things are predictable

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
so like your main navigation looks one

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
way on one page and then all of a sudden

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
it looks completely different

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
and you're not going to a new section

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
it's just like one different page

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
that's one of those things that would

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,000
fall under understandable

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
and then the last one is robust so this

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
one's kind of a tricky one it means that

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
users must pay

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,519
access to content as technology advances

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
so

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
this is one that's sort of like related

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,279
to seo in the sense that

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
accessibility is your accessibility work

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
is never done

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
um so the questions i'm asking things

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,680
like does my website

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
or app only support the newest browser

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,079
or can it work on

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,200
ie6 right or at least that's what we

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
used to say

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,880
we're a little bit better now about that

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,240
about how far you go back

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
but you know thinking about best

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
practices does this both work in

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
landscape

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
and portrait um so yeah this one's a

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,480
tricky one because it's like

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
again like the seo thing where you're

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
continually testing retesting

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,920
things come out that are new new at

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
devices so assistive technology devices

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,519
so

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,120
all the time robust robust robust so

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
again the underlying spirit

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,880
isn't about rigidity to adhering to hard

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
and fast rules

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
but it's about understanding the diverse

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
needs of your users

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,079
so once you're on board with that

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,000
following the guidelines from wcag

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,000
become more of a road map than a to-do

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,160
list

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
all right so i covered some of the

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
basics about the

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
number of people needing accessible

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
websites and apps obviously a large

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
amount of money that's kind of being

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,160
you know it's out there for the for the

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
taking for the people who are interested

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
in that

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,680
um an international set of rules that uh

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
been thought out very well

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,880
uh people in the mind so now i'm on to

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,440
the stage two so awareness was stage one

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
stage two is knowledge so at this stage

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
you're kind of aware of digital

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
inequality at some level and you kind of

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,120
maybe know a little bit about some of

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,560
the regulations like wcag

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,880
or poor principles but what else can you

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,920
do to help make your designs and your

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
code more inclusive

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,600
before you even pick up your pencil or

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,079
open up your digital design program of

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,639
choice

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,920
you need to keep a couple things in mind

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,320
first up

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,959
accessibility heuristics and the

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
question i

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,000
i get asked sometimes is what is what

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,240
are accessibility heuristics

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
accessibility specific rules of thumb

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,440
again these are inspired by waac

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,040
cag and they're built for the purpose of

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
evaluating design assets for

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
accessibility

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
so these rules help designers uh

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,000
integrate accessibility considerations

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,399
into their work

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
on this particular list was developed by

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
denis boudreau

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
over here at dq and a few other people

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
um

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,760
and this is a checklist that is

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
available for you the 2018's the latest

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
version so

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,079
that can be either found in that

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,600
resources link on the notice

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,440
so you just scroll down to the bottom of

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
the page for those resources

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,279
or you can pop in this one this bitly

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,440
over here

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,720
um but what this does is essentially

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
it's got kind of a two

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
part to it like the first part you can

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
see is this like dark blue one and it's

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
asking some of those questions it's sort

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,320
of again thinking about poor

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,160
in the sense of you know questions like

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
is this information conveyed by means

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,440
other than just color

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,279
is the foreground background contrast

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
ratio at least 4.5 to 1

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,160
or 3.1 for large text so

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
making sure that design is exempt of

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
images with embedded text

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
making sure line spacing paragraph

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,720
spacing

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
topography right any of the things that

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
you would think of it from a design

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
level

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,600
um are the selected typefaces easy to

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,240
read or do they render properly on

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
mobile

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,320
so that's another thing to consider as

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
well i think all of us at this point

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
know about rems and m's

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
and percentages and thinking about that

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
and that's really important for

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,759
accessibility

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,440
from uh topography's standpoint right so

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
you want to be able to blow things up

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
and not lose that kind of resolution

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,199
and you want them all to be related

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
throughout the page so

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,000
you know there's a lot of different

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,600
little different options there

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
um and then the second part is behind

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,320
that you can see this kind of white it's

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
like more of a checklist so it's going

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
to ask you these questions like

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,759
um that we just that i just kind of gave

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,759
you a few examples of

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,600
but it'll have ways to rate it so it's

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,519
beyond like maybe you're doing like the

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,959
very best you can very do

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,720
positive meaning that you would pass

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,560
like a wcag

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,759
assessment if someone came in and looked

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,880
at your site

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,759
negative is a fail so you would fail on

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,320
that kind of

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
assessment or not applicable so there

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,480
are things that

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
you know let's say you don't have a

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,680
media player for instance

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,160
so those you'd be exempt from on an

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
assessment

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,560
all right so beyond heuristics we also

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
talk about personas

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,839
um helena and i actually did one last

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
last year at

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,279
uh dq uh sorry at decon

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,959
um all about personas and that was a lot

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,880
of fun because we got some hands-on

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,199
interaction with people unfortunately

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
we're virtual this year so we can't do

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
something like that but

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
that was a lot of fun for people who

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
happen to be there but

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,519
for personas we're asking questions like

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,279
who are we designing and developing for

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,759
and they can help align strategy and

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,160
goals to specific user groups

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,279
so a user persona can be formal or

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,680
informal

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,120
on paper or you know just in your head

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,639
it's important when planning a new

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
website or app to keep these kind of

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
people

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,880
of varying backgrounds like you're

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,439
thinking ethnicities genders

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,000
ages technical abilities and also

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,760
disabilities as part of your personas

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
so you're working towards meeting a more

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,799
realistic variety of perspectives and

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,640
needs

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,319
so more representative of the real world

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,319
the purpose of personas is to create

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,919
reliable and realistic representations

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,880
of your key audience segments for

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,079
reference

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,240
so these representation representations

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,400
should be based on qualitative in some

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
quantitative user research if you have

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
them

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
web analytics whenever possible so go

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
ahead and

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,880
and look into your google analytics and

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
see who is coming to your site there's

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
certain things obviously you won't be

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,840
able to know

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,919
but you can have a little bit of

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,600
deduction personas help focus to

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,160
focus decisions surrounding site

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,000
components and adding that real

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,760
real world layer and consideration to

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,080
the conversation

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
a quick note about personas they're kind

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
of

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,520
double-edged sword right they are not

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,440
based on real people or stereotypes

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
there's not a substitute for user

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,039
testing they're not useful

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
if you make them and then your

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,440
developers and your designers ignore

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,480
them so there

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
there's something you want to share

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
within the team and all be on the same

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,760
page

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,400
personas usually and they should be

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,240
based on your user data if you have it

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,640
supported again by everybody and

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
communicated early and often

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
so really think this as a tool set to

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,120
help crete create empathy

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,559
and a better understanding of your users

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,880
these are github and get that link again

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,799
or you find that in the resources below

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,640
but this is the uk home offices

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
we use the these a lot in training

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
because they kind of get people to start

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
thinking about the different

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
ways people look at your site so they're

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,679
really kind of useful

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,720
i see some stuff about slides let me

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,840
know if i need to reset anything

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,520
or if it's just an individual all right

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,799
so that was the stage um two for design

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
so now armed with some more

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
accessibility design knowledge move on

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
to stage three which is practice

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,679
we're feeling more confident about

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,080
digital knowledge of digital

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,520
accessibility rules and best practices

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,679
and you can help build that knowledge

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,840
into your design process

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,240
so just for some reference about 15

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,320
years ago the word usability

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,080
was a big buzz a word for teams to

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,960
strive for in the design side

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
um but nobody really says make it usable

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,400
today now

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,039
that's just what you do this ux

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
principle

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,640
or discipline doesn't think about making

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
sure something is usable anymore because

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
it's intrinsic

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,679
so that's what we're striving for now

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
with accessibility

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
right learning to design accessibly is

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,200
habitually the same as learning to

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,280
design usually

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,120
usably is that incorporating both

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,240
heuristics that we just talked about and

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
the personas

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
and a lot of different other methods

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
that you could from user experience

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,360
point of view

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,039
and kind of grow that over time so again

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,880
i always tell people to

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
you know pick one thing that you want to

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
focus on um

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,520
and then you build it into your workflow

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
and then the next time you don't really

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,080
think about that first thing

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,480
uh and then you can build something else

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
um

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,159
that's true for code or design i talk

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,280
about that a lot

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,600
about how again people who were

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,520
designing and coding before mobile was

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,559
like a big thing

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,960
we had to relearn and re like really

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,679
remap our brains when we talked about

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
how we

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,960
are going to design and develop because

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,400
it used to just be one

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,360
set you know pixel height pixel width

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
no variability um device will always be

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
like a computer

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,440
desktop computer there's no laptops

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
right and

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
sounding really old all of a sudden but

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,120
the point is is that when mobile came

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,559
in we all had to kind of retrain

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
ourselves and think about this from

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,120
different approaches

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,039
and so it was hard at first and um

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
slow at first but eventually we got to

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
the point where i challenge one of you

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,400
guys

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
any of you to design or develop anything

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
that's not

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,240
responsive now it's it's hard it's hard

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,520
to go backwards and to think about

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,360
something that

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,960
is just so intrinsic and something that

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
we just take for granted now it's just

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,200
part of our workflow

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
um and to take that away right maybe i

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
would make it a lot

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
faster now but the same thing with

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,559
accessibility right it's this whole

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,080
idea of like building on one thing at a

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,679
time and eventually just becomes

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,240
you know part of your your gig

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,880
all right and so ux design process we

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,480
have the

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
lo-fi and the hi-fi so we're going to

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,559
kind of see examples of that

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
so here's a pattern design today we're

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,320
going to be building an image card that

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
flips when you click it

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,360
you've probably seen things like this

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,720
before in the wild

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,720
we're going to be using a modified

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
annotation symbol these are from jack

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
nikolai from adobe

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
so those are out in the wild and you can

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
create them

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,280
and put them in like any of the adobe

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
products obviously this is going to work

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,039
in

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,039
and then our person internal uh designer

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,960
and ux person aaron perlman

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,320
he's our lead designer here at dq he

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
made some modifications

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,080
for our internal needs so we're going to

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,559
have things like symbols b

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,760
and l in the red teardrops so button and

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,919
link

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,360
the green comment bubble adds specific

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
accessibility information like

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,880
accessible names

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,799
and things like the blue square symbol

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
indicate tab order so we'll look at that

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,120
a little bit

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,760
so here's a lo-fi flip flip

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,000
image card without annotations so on the

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
left you can see what our key is

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,840
and on the right is just kind of

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
something simple

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,799
and i'm looking up because i have two

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
screens and i can see it better on this

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,360
one

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
so then this next one we have it's

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
marked up right so you see some things

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,280
that are typical

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,880
in a wireframe kind of situation where

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,000
you'd have maybe

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,280
pixel sizes or

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,039
maybe if you had content right or

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
that sort of thing so kind of normal

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,880
kind of looking things and then we have

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,200
these

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
additional accessibility annotations so

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
we're telling them things like okay this

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
image is here and it's also going to be

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,600
decorative

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,240
so that sends a signal to the developer

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
hey

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
i know that i'm not going to need an alt

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,720
field or i need an empty alt field in

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
this particular case

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,679
right there's some things that are kind

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
of triggering things or this is a

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
heading right

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,080
something okay what level heading do i

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,600
want to have right

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
and then we have things like the access

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
names the access name is the

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
accessible name it's just shortened

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
shortened here so

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,440
what is it that we're going to call this

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,520
what are we going to put into

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,559
the accessibility api that screen

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
readers are going to hear

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,360
when they encounter this and then we

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,440
have this thing called the tab stop rate

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,559
where we have this one that's called

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,200
that's a it's for alpha so alpha is

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,559
where is your initial focus going to be

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
and anyone working especially with

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
javascript

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,440
um you're always thinking about your

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
focus right where is the focus indicator

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
going to go

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,400
so that is good obviously for people who

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
are using screen readers and other at

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,120
devices

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
but it's also for your keyboard only

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,720
users right what are they going to be

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,919
tabbed on where is their focus going to

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
go first right

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
and so you're always kind of thinking

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,360
about these kind of things as well so

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,159
normal stuff that you normally see in a

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,600
low-fi sort of situation with design

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,200
but just adding a little bit of an

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,440
accessibility layer on there as well

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,240
so again this is a lo-fi it's a little

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,360
bit more maybe it's a medium five here

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
outside the normal things you're

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
watching for is your designs move

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
through

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,120
development um there's a couple

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,080
accessibility-centric things

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,039
so color and font so we're talking about

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,679
contrast

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,960
type size type weight focuses we talked

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,360
about that a little bit but z

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,600
indexing spacing custom focuses that

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,240
we're going to have designed for

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,440
not just relying on the browser to build

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,400
those for us

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,279
tab order order should be correct and it

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,279
should be

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,799
it's usually depending on your

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,159
functionality but it's usually top to

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
bottom left to right

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
just as we read a page right so you

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
wouldn't want your tab to start at the

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
top

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,440
go to the bottom and then come back same

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
thing with even if you're

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,559
building just a component you want to

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
admit it to make sense

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,400
um and then of course the accessible

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
names are accessible alts

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
um or if we have alt text for an image

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
in this particular case we know this

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,600
image is decorative

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,480
so we don't necessarily need an alt in

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,640
this particular case

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,960
all right and again all of these are

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,559
some of the tools that i use

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,039
when i'm helping with designs or

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,039
accessible designs and so i've got

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,159
those again in the resources list i

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,039
won't name them all here

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,880
but just keeping in mind that especially

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,279
some of the simulators and emulators so

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,279
chrome lens no coffee and funkify

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
those are all simulating different

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,480
disabilities and so you have to keep in

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,480
the back your mind that

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
that's not about an individual right

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,559
it's a representation

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,360
and it's also more of a tool for empathy

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,480
building

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,000
um so maybe it's it's to help sell your

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,440
accessibility needs

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,640
to uh maybe the manager of the or your

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
client that you're talking to or

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,520
something like that so just kind of keep

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,200
that in the back of your mind you don't

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,919
want it to be like a one-to-one kind of

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
situation

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,120
or say all people with this disability

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
encounter sight and this is how they

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,200
experience it

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,520
no please don't do that please don't do

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
that

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,039
um but all the other ones are just

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,799
either um

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
uh tools that you can help with color

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,000
contrast or the

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,159
the posters that i talked about and

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,279
other things like that wcag

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,120
obviously is a big one too all right

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,960
so now it's time for the design team to

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
hand off their mock-ups to the front-end

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,159
developers

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,520
or if you have ux developers sometimes

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,799
or engineers

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,559
depending on the number of people and

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,159
types of roles you have at your office

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,440
this workflow might be a look a little

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
bit different but at some point

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
basically

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,799
the design needs to be translated into

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
code

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
this is where i would always get excited

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
to get the mocks from the

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
the designers especially and by sharing

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
these design

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
and wireframes with the dev team as soon

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,240
as possible um and creating the lists of

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
assets needed for each component that

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
helps the developers kind of understand

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,760
and kind of

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,520
build it in their mind what is expected

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
from them from their pattern

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,880
allows them to think about potential

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,080
technical and accessibility

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,840
issues right more deeply and earlier

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,840
so the design handoff and the engineers

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
developers are kind of like the stage

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,399
two

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,240
knowledge and it'll get to that stage

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,039
three of practice once the pattern is

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
turned into code

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,080
so just quickly here are some additional

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,360
links or guides and libraries that we

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,399
look at

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,240
i helped build the well i kind of

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,440
built the accessibility style guide so i

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,279
listed that first

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,200
but there's a lot of different component

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,559
libraries out there that are even more

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,880
robust and

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
and updated probably even more at the

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,080
time when i

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
built mine uh there was not a lot of

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
options out there so

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
check out the other ones first maybe and

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,279
then go to the back to that one but

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,320
these kind of are kind of giving you

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,960
just like

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,840
you know you do a search for a pattern

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,320
and you'd find it on

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,120
a i don't know like uh

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,559
some some random website right i don't

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,559
call anyone out but it

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,760
may be good maybe it's not like a code

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,320
pen or something

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,760
um but for accessibility purposes

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,799
there's certain places that i would

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,640
trust to look first besides the wcag

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,159
a lot of javascript frameworks if you're

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,760
building something that's decoupled or

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
something with

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
gatsby or react or something there's a

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
lot of specific ones as well for that so

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
again depending on what you're exactly

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,840
looking for that's a good kind of idea

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
so we have this idea of this flip card

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,880
maybe i'd search some of these guides or

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,679
libraries first to see

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,600
what i could find um and so usually what

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,200
i do and what most people i think did as

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
front-end developers is you find a

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,720
pattern that's

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,760
almost there or kind of like almost what

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,200
you want

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,960
and then you can make it work to what

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
you want and that's the same is true

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
with accessibility so it might not have

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,120
all the things that you need

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,799
right out of the gate but you can get it

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,480
and use it as kind of the framework to

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,520
build your accessibility uh best

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,159
practices on

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,120
so in this particular case um we're

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,679
adding

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,480
let's see oh there it is the id right

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,039
here the button id is flip 4

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
and i have the aria controls for content

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,520
here

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,279
i haven't already expanded false i have

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,240
got an id of content so

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,480
i have to have different places where i

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,120
can connect my aria

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,159
and um what it should do at different

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,880
places

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
here i have the alt as is equal to null

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,159
so that's uh

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,080
not an empty alt but a or i'm sorry it's

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,159
an empty alt not a missing alt

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,840
so that again signifies to the a t users

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,080
you know this is just decorative ignore

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,520
those kind of thing

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,279
so there's a lot of different ways to do

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,600
it here's a little snippet

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,440
of the javascript that is doing it i'm

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,159
going through it because you have an

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,960
access to this as well and the resources

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,120
so

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,240
again practice for devs stage three for

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,399
devs um

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,240
we kind of the knowledge part was you

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,000
know little guides in the libraries

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
and then what do you do with it right so

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
these things these resources i find

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,520
really

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,200
valuable because they help bridge that

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,760
gap between the theory

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,679
and the reality right so you have

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,919
accessibility project which is great

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,799
aria specs um ali slack and twitter

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,000
if you're not already on that main w3c

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,880
uh slack channel let me

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,200
know it's invite only now only because

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,799
we got spammers a few years ago but

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
there's thousands of people and there's

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,799
a drupal channel and there's all kinds

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,880
of other channels that are in there so

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
pretty much anything that you have

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,080
questions about people

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
are there to answer so i can't say

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,279
anything more highly about it than that

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,960
if you're interested in this kind of

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,520
topic and obviously twitter there's a

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,919
lot of people there as well

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
quick reference guides by the wcag are

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,960
actually really good too they've got a

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,640
lot of patterns but they also go into

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,279
into depth of why of the y

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,039
all right so now we have all we've

00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,760
tilled the soil we planted water the

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
seeds

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
and we let some light in so we're done

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,519
growing our accessible component right

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,799
well almost uh if your garden is

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,559
intended to

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,720
uh just like your components weeds creep

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,919
in and take over so

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,760
i know a lot of people don't like to

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,720
weed a garden but it's a necessary task

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,640
otherwise your flowers will die

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
similarly accessibility audits and

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,360
testing are not super glamorous

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
but they're very necessary so it's just

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,679
like weeding

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
it's just one of those things it's not a

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
one and done activity you don't read one

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
time and then you're done for the whole

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,000
season

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,760
accessibility testing is exactly the

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,840
same it's never done

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,600
uh you have new updates to browsers

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,399
assistive technology devices

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,720
are updated all the time markup rules

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,240
code regressions etc etc

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,640
so you should consider accessibility

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,640
testing as an ongoing maintenance task

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,080
so you need to make sure you set aside

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
time each month

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,559
or each sprint or something uh to review

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
the accessibility of whatever you're

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
working on

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,039
that way you can catch your mistakes

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,320
when they're small and easy

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,320
to manage or fix

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,760
accessibility so again i work for a

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
company that makes a lot of their money

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,360
off of

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,880
tools right besides ax core that you see

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,640
there's a lot of different tools that we

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
that we sell to people i'm not going to

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,840
talk about them because i i'm not one of

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,559
those people that does

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
or i don't market um but point is is

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,640
that

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,720
you know everyone wants to automate

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,200
everything um

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,120
same for our company we want to do it

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,799
someday we want accessibility to be one

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,519
of those things you press a button

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,840
and then it just does it um we poof we

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,679
stay i say we summon magical creatures

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,720
and they can go in and they find and fix

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,080
all of the issues but unfortunately that

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
regardless of the tool

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,880
that you're using right now that kind of

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,159
automatic testing can only reliably pick

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,600
up 30 to 40 percent of your issues

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,360
and some tools are better at picking up

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,039
some issues than others

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,519
so you have to use a suite of tools on

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,440
top of that the issues the automatic

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,440
testing tools do find

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,840
many still require a human to interpret

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,840
the results and prioritize the issues

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,760
a big example i see all the time

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,760
automated tool tells you that your image

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,039
is missing alternative text

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,440
but it can't tell you what the

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,399
alternative text is to write

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,919
and so it just kind of gets exhausting

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,760
but of course that's not

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,760
it's not all bad news the good news is

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,159
that automated testing tools are

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,110
truly amazing and getting smarter with

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,559
each new version

00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,640
[Music]

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,000
again shout out to some products that

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
are out there that are getting smarter

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,799
and smarter

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,559
i'm hoping someday they'll be a tool

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,919
that we can you know get closer and

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,519
closer to that hundred percent a

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,919
mythical hundred percent

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
but until then you can add those ux ui

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,279
tests

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
uh manual keyboard tests mobile touch

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
tests

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
screen reader tests and other ats don't

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,919
forget about

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,360
the other ats that are out there so that

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,799
could be speech to text

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,320
that could be some braille device that

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,159
you're using right there's a lot of

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,640
different ats beyond screen readers so

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,440
keep that in the back your mind as well

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,880
content readability tests readability

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,519
there's a lot of free ones that are out

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,639
there

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,079
hemingway grammarly the readability

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
tools there's a bunch that are out there

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
that can tell you

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,480
you know the gaps that you have in your

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,639
content

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,480
but last but not least i think user

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,079
tests are the most important to consider

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,079
for your workflow

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,280
they're not necessarily the cheapest or

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,599
the fastest

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,960
but they are the most robust and the

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
deepest

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,839
the kind of feedback that you'll get so

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,599
think about that too and some

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,359
opportunities for uh

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,119
getting that into your workflow

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,960
and one really quick thing to do don't

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,679
forget about an accessibility statement

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,280
or an accessible way for your users to

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,119
contact you

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
we had a client once who did not have a

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,399
statement of course

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,800
but then they also had an inaccessible

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,440
content uh contact us

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
uh form so they couldn't even report

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
when they did have an issue

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,000
so just kind of that's a pretty low bar

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
kind of

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
idea so if you only take one thing away

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,160
you know go out right now test your form

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,320
and add an accessibility statement

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,839
um here's a quick little demo of the

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,720
actual thing in

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,160
uh the pattern in live i'm going to do a

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,720
screen reader i'm going to undo my

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,720
mic here let me know if you can hear us

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,960
oh it's good not talking but we can see

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,520
the um

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,800
yeah for some reason it's not picking it

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,640
up so we can halt

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,640
we can hear the um

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,000
oh i'm gonna pop it

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,440
i know what it is sir sorry let me get

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
my sound on the right one

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,760
live demo my sound's going into the yeti

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,880
so it's not um let's do display audio

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,359
let's see if that one works

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,720
can we hear that now you are currently

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,160
on the heading level too

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,079
true or false technology

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,480
you are currently on a button to click

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,880
this button press control options

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,520
true or false slopes are carnivores

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,240
false

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,119
slopes mainly the tree bonds new shoots

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,000
fruit and leaves

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,960
but the supropia tree expanded button

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,359
true or false

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
slopes are carnivores collapse button

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,560
true or false

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,560
slopes live in trees true or false

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,720
slopes live in trees

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,839
all right i won't i won't do that the

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,400
whole time because uh

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,359
that might be so annoying but the point

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,599
is is that this

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,280
this card does exist hopefully you guys

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,000
yeah and this is

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
um there is a fun kind of thing you can

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,280
um

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,920
teach your screen reader to read a

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,160
specific

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,720
dialect or a certain word because like

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,200
dq always gets picked up as

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,800
deke and so you can change it to make it

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,040
sound a little bit more like

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,560
your actual uh company name if you've

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,240
got an interesting company name or

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,440
unusual one

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,640
that the ats don't like so again some of

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,720
the things that i would recommend for

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,400
testing automatic testing tools

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,760
keyboard touch devices we talked about

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,359
some screen readers

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,800
combinations of screen readers are

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,320
really important too so

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
these are kind of the ones i'm i'm

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,599
leaving you here with

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,000
windows chrome firefox plus nvda nvda

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,440
is is edging out jaws only because jaws

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,240
is expensive

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,200
um and nvda is just as good in most

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
cases

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,960
um that's kind of the gold standard

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,839
that's that so if you have a mac like i

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,520
do

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,119
you need to get yourself a virtual

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,560
machine or a dedicated machine or

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,599
someone on your team who's doing that

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,079
kind of testing

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,680
should have that um just like again

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,000
hardware and software goes together so

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,040
safari plus voice over

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,880
for android's chrome or firefox talkback

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,520
and for safari voiceover um

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,440
and again web developer toolbar content

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,640
readability test that sort of thing

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,760
uh kind of fun fact as well uh safari

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,560
voice over

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,280
on ios is better than safari voiceover

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,720
on

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,480
mac desktop who knows different teams i

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,599
suppose different constraints but

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,720
um so now we're at the full bloom we're

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,079
kind of running out of time so i'll go a

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,640
little bit faster here at the end

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
but we're almost done as we discussed

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,240
there are four

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,359
uh different stages so the last stage is

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,880
understanding

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,640
so we've just discussed a different

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,560
stage of just the

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,079
digital accessibility that we're all on

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,880
so true beginners might not even

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
be to stage one but i am finding that

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,640
group

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,520
rare and rare so now we're on more on

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
stage two

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,119
knowledge and stage three which is

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,880
practice so you're aware of digital

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,880
accessibility guidelines maybe you know

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,560
a few testing tools

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
but you don't quite understand and you

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,400
haven't really quite connected these

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,839
dots to the humans they impact

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,520
from the standpoint of getting stuff

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,520
done i was at stage

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,119
two and three for years and years and

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,880
years and so

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,280
they're okay stopping points uh for

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,359
getting your job done um but i have to

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,400
kind of give challenge you a little bit

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,560
so what happens when

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,599
things that you need are too complex for

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,280
a quick fix

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,680
or you don't have buy-in from your peers

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,200
or your management i feel like when we

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
all kind of collectively get to the

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,119
stage four of understanding

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,160
and really like getting to why these

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,000
changes are needed

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
uh people will be more motivated to make

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
those changes regardless of the

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,880
challenges that

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,800
are involved so i think that's when this

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,240
true change of accessibility

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,320
in the digital sphere will will happen

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,920
um i love this coach so well in this one

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,320
with this the power of the web

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,079
is in its universality access by

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,320
everyone regardless of disability is

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,480
essential aspect

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,000
so i'm hoping that we get there soon and

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,320
i think that this is one way to get it

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,040
so hopefully you learned a few things

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,720
and you can apply that into your

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,839
workflow

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,839
one pattern at a time awesome

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,520
yep and lots of links so i'm just

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,680
looking here i kind of

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,960
ended a few minutes for early in case

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:11,839
anyone had any questions

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,839
or i missed one along the way

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,079
it's nice to see all your faces

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,839
virtually of course yeah

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,680
nice all right

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,960
well thank you all for attending if you

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,079
have any other questions you know where

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,319
to find me

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,200
um i believe that this is recorded

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,440
somewhere

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,599
and i apologize someone did come to our

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,760
to my door in the middle of the

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,040
presentation i could hear my dog

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:49,200
sparking in the background hopefully

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:49,200
