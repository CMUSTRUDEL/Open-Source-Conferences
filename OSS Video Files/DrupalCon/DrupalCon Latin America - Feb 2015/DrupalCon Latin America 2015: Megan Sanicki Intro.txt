00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:34,260
Latin America and how you're so

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,510
strategic to the project and how you've

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,950
contributed to that and what we can

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,899
start doing together which is really

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,879
exciting to me so I want to start with

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,590
the Drupal associations vision I think

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,610
Holly talked about this yesterday and

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,520
our vision is for Drupal to be a leading

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,120
platform around the world and why is

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,180
this important it's because Drupal has

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,199
the power to change lives it creates all

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,400
kinds of opportunities new jobs lots of

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,140
learning opportunities to be leaders you

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,119
can get a global perspective by working

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,530
with people around the world and most

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,360
importantly you get these meaningful

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,259
friendships that's really special to

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,210
Drupal and we're really excited to

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,650
establish this kind of vision by working

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,700
with the community and delivering

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,790
programs such as improving drupal.org

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,409
marketing Drupal Drupal cons all kinds

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,759
of community programs grants and

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,710
scholarships and I know that together we

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,100
have already achieved a lot and I want

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,619
to talk about that today and I want to

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,290
give credit to the community leaders

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,049
that saw early on that Drupal has this

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,390
power to change lives and they wanted to

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,520
bring these opportunities to Latin

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,930
America and so I'm going to be telling

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,170
some of their stories as i talked about

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,329
how Drupal is leading today how Latin

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,210
America is strategic to the project and

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,920
then how you became strategic how did

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,329
you grow like this those are really

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,329
special stories and I'd like to share

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,710
so just to let you know you are a very

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,350
good company Drupal is one of the

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,470
largest open source projects in the

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,050
world we have over 33,000 developers and

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,080
as we work on Drupal 8 together we have

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,760
over 2,300 people collaborating which is

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,520
really significant raise your hand if

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,880
you're working on Drupal 8 that's

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,210
fantastic fantastic and together we

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,370
build over a million websites and we are

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,400
powering twelve percent of the top 100

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,350
thousand sites and there's so much more

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,450
room to grow in many ways that we can

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,130
lead in many ways that we could grow for

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,930
example maybe we want to be fifty

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,540
percent of the top 100 thousand sites

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,310
these are goals that we have we have big

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,050
visions and we're going to do it

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,540
together and we're going to need Latin

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,130
America to help us drees wrote a blog

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,440
post that you might have read that

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,730
talked about some of the ways that Latin

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
America is strategic and I'd like to

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,400
talk about that but I'd like to go a

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,610
little deeper and explain how the

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,670
community has become strategic in the

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,209
different areas and they include helping

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:20,570
us globally regionally and also with the

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:24,260
code that picture means nothing to me

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,630
right now anyhow let's talk about the

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,840
global situation there is great demand

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,480
for Drupal on a global scale which is

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,459
fantastic one of our barriers is talent

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,049
we just don't have enough talent and I

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,540
think that's happening everywhere right

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,480
but in the u.s. I just look at where I

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,840
come from in the United States we have

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,540
thousands of jobs we can't fill mostly

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,660
developers and theme or jobs and so it's

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,400
really hard to meet the demand we even

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,230
did a survey that confirmed this and

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
there's hiring managers out there that

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,519
are just spending so much time and money

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,019
looking for talent and I really think

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,000
that Latin America has done a great job

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,060
growing the community you have a great

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,070
talent base job talking to businesses it

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,350
seems that there's good capacity to to

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,390
bridge the gaps around talent and work

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,040
together and there's already some really

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,020
strong examples of this happening a

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,080
nexus IT was telling me some of their

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,580
stories and also rootstock is also

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,090
another great example because they're in

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,430
Panama

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,490
it still has strong US business

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,780
relationships and and so this is

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,210
happening all over with different

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,919
businesses I really encourage people to

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,540
look at these models to see how they can

00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,600
help bridge the gap around talent and

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,010
also it'll work together and one of my

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,270
favorite stories is I was interviewing

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:43,280
people was from Carlos Oh pinus I think

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,470
I just said that right yeah yeah they're

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,660
guys he's waving his hand thank you so I

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,880
really told me so many things that he's

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,500
doing to grow the community he's he's a

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,470
Colombian who lives in the United States

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,300
and while he's there learning drupal he

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,250
is taking the time to go to camps help

00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,870
grow them he's received scholarships

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,240
from the drupal association to go to

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,450
drupal cons and he's out there looking

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,919
for companies who need talent and he has

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,660
all these connections here in latin

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,360
america and so he's doing a lot of

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,039
matchmaking because he really wants to

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,050
make sure this happens and that people

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,030
have these opportunities worth rupal and

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,710
in addition to that he's also making

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,139
sure that there's really competitive

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,910
rates for latin americans you get jobs

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,770
through him I think that's really

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,690
amazing because it's not that he just

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,979
wants people to have jobs but he wants

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,740
to make sure that everyone has a better

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,450
life because of Drupal and I just think

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,400
that's a really amazing contribution so

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,380
thank you and so there's a lot more we

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,729
can do there and we're looking forward

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,690
to see how we can help with a group of

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:46,190
association too so that in America

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,470
cannot just be supporting people

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,539
globally for Drupal to lead means

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,910
leading everywhere and it's important

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,139
that we grow Drupal adoption here in

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,539
Latin America and that's already

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,190
happening in a big way just talking to a

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,289
lot of the different businesses there is

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,979
excellent case studies already and you

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:06,020
can see them from e-commerce to banking

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,960
publishing universities it's happening

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,360
everywhere and I know that there's room

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,160
for a lot more and we're also going to

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,410
need talents that you can serve globally

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,729
and regionally right so these camps your

00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,169
global training days all the things you

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,050
do to bring people in the community is

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:24,169
going to be even more important and I

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,169
just want to talk about how how it

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,849
became that Drupal was starting to be

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,280
adopted in a big way in Latin America

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,910
and from what I see one is that you have

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,740
freelance

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,320
freelancers who are very brave that

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,600
started a business it's not easy to do a

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,150
start-up and to put all that together

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,430
and so that's a really big shift that

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,320
happened and then they started marketing

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,590
locally so just talking with seed they

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,630
do really strong SEO really smart

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,520
they're doing reach local events Drupal

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,930
in a day there's all kinds of different

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,820
marketing activities happening from

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,550
these businesses that are investing in

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,070
Drupal marketing but we also have

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,960
individuals that are doing things to get

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,340
the word out there about Drupal and I

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
want to acknowledge what Nick Vidal is

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,050
doing in in Brazil he's a community

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,430
leader there and he's helping to grow

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,470
the community in a big way on many

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,540
fronts one things that I was really

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,330
impressed with is he's been going to

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,480
major open-source events Latino where

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,490
feisal few others and he's making sure

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,740
Drupal has a good presence there and is

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,810
getting getting the presence it deserves

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,970
and that's helping to get as traction he

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,160
also used a grant to write a spanish

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,900
magazine about Drupal and use that to

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,240
spread the word of Drupal which is just

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,740
fantastic and really creative I've seen

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,900
other people that are making sure that

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,170
we're getting into publications like CIO

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:47,060
Peru just covered drupalcon I saw that

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:48,830
Drupal Latino summit has gotten into pc

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,680
world so there's just a lot of things

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,210
that companies and individuals are doing

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,400
to make a really big impact of road

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,150
rupal here in latin america and i think

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,190
that's something you should be really

00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,780
proud of I'm also looking forward to see

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:06,350
how the Association can help you on that

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:08,780
front too and then lastly the other area

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,910
that I see is a great way that Latin

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,120
America's strategic to the project is in

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,800
the code base contributing code so for

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,980
Drupal to be a leader we need to be

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,750
innovative have innovative software and

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,910
that innovation comes from diverse input

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,390
from everyone around the world we really

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,580
need to capture Latin America's passion

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,950
and creativity all your intelligence and

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,630
our code base so raise your hand if

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,610
you've contributed maybe not just not to

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,180
do anything any kind of code whether

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,580
it's Drupal 7 Drupal 8 can I see hands

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,560
yeah I got even more that's great that's

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,969
really important and for all of you that

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,180
didn't raise your hand I hope that you

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,000
will it's really important that you

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,890
contribute to the project it's it's

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,530
something that is good for your resume

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,390
helps you with jobs it also is your way

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,890
of giving back and we can talk some more

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,560
about that because if you don't give

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,150
back we don't grow this project you end

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,990
up stunting your own opportunities you

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,589
should really look at it that way

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,030
they're very connected i also want to

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,550
just call out that it's not just

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,160
individuals contributing that there is a

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,750
budding contribution culture and

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,490
companies here and that's really

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,110
important that companies support their

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,760
employees to give back code that they

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,870
encourage their clients to allow them to

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,990
give back code and as one example is

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,790
touch air and i think i pronounced that

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,130
right i was working on that and then

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,220
also seed is another one i really

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,870
enjoyed talking with aldo biere about

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,810
why why is that important for him in his

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,670
company that he make sure his company is

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,230
giving back code and one is it just

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,910
shows their expertise right on your

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,470
organizational profile you get to show

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,660
all of the contributions from your staff

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,150
and that's powerful but what i really

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,790
liked was when he answered that it's

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:55,130
really more emotional it feels good to

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,690
give back so when he contributes a

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,810
module and he'll say it's a simple

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,700
module it's just a simple module but

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,890
then he gets an email that says thank

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,300
you so much you just really solve

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,820
something that I didn't know how to do

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,959
or that made my life a lot easier and

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,940
now I could just move on to the next

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,459
thing for my project I just thank you so

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,420
much it just feels good to know that

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,610
you're helping others in your community

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,709
and I think that's a great culture to

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,370
adopt within a company so I certainly

00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:25,520
encourage that and I do encourage

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,470
everyone to go to the sprits tomorrow so

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,600
they can learn how to contribute and be

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,400
a part of this we have some sprint

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,120
mentors here if you can raise your hands

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,160
for it meant Wars there we go seek them

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,600
out they're really special they want to

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,760
help you get to that process and

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,390
understand how to contribute they're

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,390
making it a lot easier

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,420
so there's a lot of ways that the Latin

00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,420
American community is strategic to the

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,269
project and it's really amazing how

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,939
you've grown and be you are able to get

00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,490
to this place and that's because of

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:05,009
really passionate people like I

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,079
mentioned as people that early on had a

00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:09,029
vision they saw that Drupal provides

00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,100
opportunities they wanted to share those

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,870
opportunities here it in Latin America

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,730
and they put a lot of countless hours

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,790
into creating the community that you

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,019
have today and so you can see some of

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,120
the pictures of people I've mentioned

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,040
there's so many people that I haven't

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,319
been able to work into my talk and only

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,300
have a few minutes but together

00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,550
throughout Latin America there are these

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,649
community leaders that have really grown

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,189
things in a big way just some statistics

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:37,680
are see the this year that are this past

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:40,230
year there were 19 global training days

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,250
and this is companies or people that

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,279
said please come in you know enter

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:49,470
welcoming all the newcomers and giving

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,089
them some simple training free or near

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,850
free it's just a really good on ramp

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,339
into the community and then we've had in

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,829
2013 we had ten camps throughout the

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,930
region that brought together over 2,000

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,339
people and these are really important to

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,839
have these camps because you start

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,480
taking the newcomers and also your

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,279
existing community members and you start

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
leveling up a skill that's how you start

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,870
growing the community and also getting

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,649
more expertise and then just in January

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,689
we had the sprint weekend which is

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,069
really popular all around the world so

00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:21,809
much participation we had four countries

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,759
participating here in Latin America

00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:27,930
which is wonderful and we'd love to see

00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,309
more of that and then we also have in

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,769
this region something I think it's

00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:33,449
pretty special community members had

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,980
gone to drupalcon they saw that magic

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:36,540
that happens they saw the kinds of

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,649
learnings you have when you have people

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:43,889
cross borders and share and they created

00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:46,350
the Drupal Latino summit and this is a

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:49,350
really special event that brought people

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,569
together for the first time and it's

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,760
happened three times and because of that

00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:56,610
they were able to do drupal Picchu and

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,140
and that grew the community room or and

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,270
created this regional strength that you

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,740
need to sustain a drupalcon and it's

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,380
because of all this work that we're all

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,000
here today so I just want to thank the

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,610
community leaders for doing this work

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,190
I'm really excited that we're able to do

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:15,390
this one things I wanted to share too is

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:19,440
that drupalcon Amsterdam in 2005 had

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:21,000
about 100 people and then they all left

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,230
and they all worked in their community

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,890
and they grew and they grew their

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,540
businesses and we went back in 2014 and

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,840
there were two thousand three hundred

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,490
people so imagine what that means for

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,830
this group and where you're going to be

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,420
the next time we come back I mean as you

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,530
have some work to do but I know that

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,700
you're going to have that magic from

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,790
drupalcon and go back to your

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,590
communities and really grow and I want

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,390
to point out that we're not just growing

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,950
as a community we're not just getting

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,780
people we're mindful about it we're

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,580
being we're making sure we're diverse

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,640
and that's because we have people like

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,110
Karen d'cruz who are making sure that

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,240
women are coming to the table and feel

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,830
comfortable later today at the closing

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,840
session we're going to tell you how what

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,580
the percentage of women are here it's

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,510
pretty significant is because of people

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,610
like Karen she started drupal and it was

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,900
you know for her job and someone said no

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,510
we have a whole community come to the

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,370
meetups that's really important and she

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,930
came and she's a good let's see enough

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,000
women I don't feel so you know maybe

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,470
this isn't my place and she was

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,210
encouraged no no you need to have make

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,610
it your place and she did and in Peru

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,900
she started Women in Technology and just

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,660
got women coming together to talk about

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,790
technology in general and then at Drupal

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,080
peaches she created a panel that Holly

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,480
Ross our executive director said on and

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,240
it just really started something women's

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,010
could see other women up there on stage

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,480
talking and talking about what it meant

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,960
to be a woman in Drupal how they

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,360
participate and contribute back and it

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,640
really kind of created a spark for other

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,650
women so woman by the name of Veronica

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,990
who went to booze from Bolivia she went

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,750
back home she is not into public

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,760
speaking she is just not her thing but

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,820
she was passionate about making this

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,140
happen in Bolivia and so now Karen is

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,600
supporting her and giving her the

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,670
encouragement she needs to start making

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,690
Bolivia become more diverse as well and

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,160
this is happening all the other

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:16,560
countries and that's because of people

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,269
like Karen so thank you and so I love

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,579
telling stories I could tell stories all

00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,350
day because you inspired me so much and

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,750
this is one that is just near and dear

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,149
to my heart and so Fernando and an say I

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,220
would like to tell your story to be

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:32,130
honest with you everyone I interviewed

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,870
for this talk said you you can't tell my

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,329
story if you don't tell Fernando's and

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,560
nancy's and I was like okay well tell me

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,990
why and they would tell me their stories

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,519
and really Fernando was behind many of

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,899
the reasons people stepped up to help

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,370
grow this community and and so a little

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,800
bit of his story it's a very long story

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,519
so I'm just doing the justice in two

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,870
seconds but he started drupal at about

00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:00,120
2007 and it was a tool and a job and in

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,910
2009 he was awarded a scholarship to go

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,740
to drupalcon in washington DC and that's

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,319
when he saw that there's this amazing

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,350
community with all these opportunities

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:13,139
that you can have if you just tapped in

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:16,500
and so he really had more of a mission

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,120
to come back to Latin America and share

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,130
these opportunities with everyone and

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,589
grow the community so they can really

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,060
take advantage of the benefits one

00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:27,389
thing's too is that he attended a

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,980
session I was about Drupal around the

00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,589
world and he realized Latin America at

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,079
that time this is 2009 really wasn't on

00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,930
the map and so he said not only do I

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,339
want to go to Latin America back home to

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,620
share these benefits of RuPaul but I

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,699
want to make us important want to make

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,939
us important to this project because

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:46,470
this is significant and now today I can

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,360
stand on stage and even tell you all the

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,160
ways your significant I think that's

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,160
amazing he's been a driving force behind

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,170
camps the regional summits Drupal Picchu

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,509
he's encouraged so many people like

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,630
Karen d'cruz to step up and get more

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:06,539
women in this community and it's just

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,579
really significant what he's done and I

00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,860
want to point out to you that he has not

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,630
done it alone his wife Nancy has been by

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,870
his side the whole time supporting him

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,130
and she's working independently of him

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,020
as well she's not a coder

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,910
and that's okay because everyone has a

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,310
role in this community and she's been

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,260
contributing by supporting the camps and

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,670
other community programs and making sure

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,040
people feel welcome making sure the

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,850
logistics work she does a lot of

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,290
knitting she uh you know expresses her

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:39,310
love for Drupal through knitting and I

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,660
just love her hat but even this week I

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,610

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,320

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,000
and she just sat down in reg and I can't

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,410
