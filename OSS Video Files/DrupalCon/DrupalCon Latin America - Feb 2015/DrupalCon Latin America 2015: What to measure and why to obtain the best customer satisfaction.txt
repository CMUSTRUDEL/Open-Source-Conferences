Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: akucharski
Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. - Albert Einstein, Physicist

This is a business session that will reflect on our drive towards understanding what should be measured and why as a tool to improving our financial performance and client satisfaction. We start at looking at many different ways to measure project progress, support SLAs developer performance, team performance, company performance and client satisfaction. We will discuss the many different metrics, how they are used and what are their outcomes. No measures will be spared, progress, efficiency, effectiveness, response time, resolution, costs, productivity, utilization, workload, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction. We will examine the many possibilities of measurement and the measures we find valuable.

What you will learn:
- different ways to measure company performance
- different ways to measure support & operations
- ways to measure customer satisfaction

Who should attend:
- managers
- project managers
- team leads
- developers

It's 5:45, so that means that we're going to start right on time, right?

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:15,490
This is the custom of the land, I understand. Everything runs like a German train system,

00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,650
on time. Actually, I'm going to kind of hang out and

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,029
talk and ask some questions, and then we're going to dive into it if some people come.

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,580
My name's Andy Kucharski. I'm going to say all this stuff again.

00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,279
This is a business talk. I'm going to try to slow down.

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,719
So hands. Do we have some folks who are running businesses?

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,559
Okay, so you guys are running businesses. Where is everybody from?

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,899
Texas. Whoa. Texas. Denmark.

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,559
Denmark? Okay.

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,959
Where are you from? -Korea.

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,930
-Okay, so this is the... If anybody is from South America, you cannot sit on that side.

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,480
Welcome, welcome. I was just in Korea a couple...

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,600
Who do you work for in Korea? Which company? Open F? Great.

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,060
Brazil. -U.S.

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:20,010
-U.S. You got to go on that side. -I live in Equador.

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,980
-Oh, okay. Peru. Peru.

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,460
-Colombia. -Colombia.

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,720
-California. -California. You guys are getting it wrong.

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,440
Brazil. Okay, we're going to start in one minute.

00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,650
Okay, so... I guess. I may be being recording right now.

00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,610
-You are. -I am? Okay, so my talk is going to be about

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,440
measuring everything, and it's a personal journey of many, many mistakes that we have

00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,090
made in my company, and so I'll share those with you, and it's an evolving journey, so

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:09,090
I am here, of course, to learn from you guys, and hopefully I can share some things that

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,840
will help you avoid making some of the mistakes that we've made.

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,890
My name is Andrew Kucharski. I am the founder and president of Promet Source.

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,150
Those are my kids, and I think they are making a snowman, wondering where their dad is because

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,150
I'm always on the road. I do travel, I do Drupal stuff, and I run

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,900
Promet Source. I've been doing this... Well, I've been in

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,780
consulting and a manager and running the business for about 20 years now.

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,560
As you can probably tell from the previous picture, I am from Chicago, and in Chicago

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,350
we are Promet Source. We are a Drupal development shop founded in

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,990
2003. We've been doing Drupal since 2008, so that's

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,650
seven years now. We offer 24/7 support, and we focus on custom

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,510
development, and this is important for the talk.

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,220
So we do custom development. We also provide DevOps service.

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,630
We have a DevOps philosophy, so we have support services, system administrators that work

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,569
with developers and our support team, and we provide support to our clients, and that

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:42,569
is a separate service line. I like measuring things, and that's really

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,569
why this is a fun talk for me. I was just in my hotel, and I realized that

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:56,569
up to today, I took 4,878 steps. I use Fitbit. I'm happy to report that right now I am up

00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,940
to 6,767 steps. If I keep on walking, it's going to help me.

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,819
I like this stuff. I like statistics. I look at numbers, so I see how much I sleep.

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,790
Just because I look at it, I know how well rested I am and how much more sleep I need.

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,169
Not really. But I also like competing with some friends,

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,660
so everybody who has Fitbit right now, I'm doing pretty good right now.

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,800
Maybe, if you have a Fitbit, friend me and we'll compete.

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Another measure, I have this scale at home, and in the last 2.8 years I've weighed myself

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,490
864 times. Luckily, as you see, this trend is going down.

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,940
That's good. I hit a milestone right after Christmas, the

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,910
heaviest I've ever been, but it's trending down, right?

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,560
That's important. Obviously I like numbers and I like measurement,

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,560
but what does that have to do with business? Well, I put something in the beginning of

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,440
this talk about numbers which inspired, I think, the DA to accept this and

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,710
vote for it, but I think it's true. Data is important.

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,240
I like this saying: "In God we trust, all others bring data."

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,150
And this second one is really important, and I think that what gets measured gets attention

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,150
and gets results. I truly believe that.

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
More words about metrics, right? Besides the personal inspiration we get from

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,800
these metrics that help us motivate us to lose weight or walk more, in business they

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,400
tell us about what we're doing, right? So they can be used for marketing.

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,590
Are we committing enough? Are we delivering on time?

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,070
Do we have less bugs? We have, what, 56 critical defects in Drupal? That tells us something.

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,290
We still don't have an end date, but it's less than 149, right? So that's good.

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,199
It's a little bit of marketing, but it's good information to share with your stakeholders.

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,490
It gives them a sense that it's not just your opinion, but you're backing your information

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,500
by some fact. Okay, well 56 critical tickets. That means

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,410
it's going down. That's good. We're on the right path.

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,380
It's a good way of communicating, but I think the most important part of it is, and I've

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,220
noticed this around my teams and, I think, others, is that what gets measured gets results

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,620
and it gets attention from your team. If you're running a business or a team and

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,290
you're looking at measuring some instance that you want to improve, for example, your

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,949
team will notice that you're doing it and you're doing it on a regular basis, and you'll

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,949
hopefully get the results that you're looking for by measuring them.

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,169
Before we start looking at more numbers, I think your CEO from Taller...

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,979
-Taller. -Taller ... did a really nice job on the earlier presentation.

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:15,520
I encourage you to see it online about setting vision and starting with "why?" and having

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,290
a passion for what they're doing, and I think that measuring all things also starts with

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,930
this think. You start a business or you start a venture,

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,690
and you think about, "Why are we doing this? Why is this important?"

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,380
That drives the mission. Dries talked about this at the Acquia summit

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,190
yesterday. He talked about, "Well, at Acquia we started

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,080
writing down what are we about?" He's got it down to five sentences, I think

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,280
he said. From that, you get goals, and from goals you

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,190
break that down into objectives. What are we going to do next?

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,960
What's next? From that, you get KPIs, right?

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
What are our key performance indicators? And then you break that down further into

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,490
metrics. So that's the kind of exercise that we like

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,190
to go through that I think is important. For example, my management team, on a weekly

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,550
basis, we have a set of numbers, and it's not too many. It's just a few numbers, and

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,850
we thought about it really hard at the beginning of the year.

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,639
What do we want to report on? Those numbers, they may be responsible for

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,940
the developers or the other teams that generate those, but it helps us drive the business,

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,100
and it starts with the top. What do I get evaluated on?

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,959
I'm a CEO of a small company. We're about 30-40 people, depending on how

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,709
you measure, maybe up to 50. My primary way that I get evaluated is financial

00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:45,829
performance of the company. That is revenue and net profit.

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:51,339
Okay, well what about all these other things? What about giving back to the community? What

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,689
about client satisfaction, which is really important?

00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,429
What about your retention? Are your folks happy?

00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:03,709
I believe that it is my job to make sure that we have good financial performance so that we

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:09,029
can achieve all these other things and anybody else doesn't have to worry about those things.

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,869
Once we have that footing, we can do things to increase client satisfaction.

00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:16,189
We can do things. We have the time for developers to go to camps.

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,399
We can do all of those things, so my primary job is very simple, right?

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,610
I get measured in hard numbers. Did we hit our profit objective?

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,939
Did we hit our revenue objective? Yes or no, right?

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:34,639
Luckily, I can't get fired. Maybe not yet, so it makes it a little bit easier, but it's

00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,589
key. There is also a concept of a balanced scorecard,

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,879
so that's a concept of measuring a lot of other things besides that one number.

00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,149
That is also important, and we look back on it and we take a look at it from an annual

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:54,149
performance basis, so we look at those few hard numbers for our team and for myself,

00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,519
and then we take a look at a balanced scorecard. Okay, well now that you've hit this number

00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,970
or maybe now that you're having a problem hitting this number, let's take a look at

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,809
these other activities and other parts of what we're doing to see whether we're hitting

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,239
that. We look at the financial perspective, and

00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:13,519
we look at financial perspective for all of our key members.

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,279
We look at customer perspective, so this is very, very important to us, and the second

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:25,279
part of my presentation is really mostly about customer perspective, internal perspective,

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:30,739
so are we creating people who are growing themselves?

00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:35,040
Are they enjoying what they're doing? Are we doing good things?

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,360
Are we growing professionally? That's one of my goals as well, right?

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,360
So I get measured on financial performance. My personal goal is to grow as a CEO and become

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,199
a better leader. Those other things are important, but they're

00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:58,040
not as clean-cut as, "Did you hit your number?" Just a little bit of balanced perspective

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,040
here. Karen, I didn't know you were going to be here.

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,329
This is Karen.

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:16,329
Just a question: How am I doing in terms of... Am I doing good in terms of speaking too fast

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,959
or... good? You guys are okay? Perfect.

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,959
Uh oh. -[inaudible] passing the microphone.

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,040
-Okay, so yeah. I'll walk around. I'm pretty good with that. All right.

00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,579
Further.

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,800
So this is Karen. She's one of our project managers.

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,800
She just so happens to be sitting right here. Last time I gave this talk, she was on another

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:01,819
continent, so sorry Karen. Karen has some measurable objectives in terms

00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:07,269
of what we're looking for, and that is project profitability, right?

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,339
We share project profitability with all of our project managers, so we have certain goals

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,739
at the end of the year. We review whether we're hitting those goals.

00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:24,739
Client satisfaction. So there is the financial objective, and there's

00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,819
client satisfaction. I should have put that one as number one.

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,220
Our net promoter score, I'll explain what that is, is number one.

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,119
Are our clients happy? Team growth, revenue contribution.

00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:42,569
So is Karen managing big projects, small projects, how are they doing?

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,519
Is she supporting us in terms of marketing? By the way, so here's a plug: Karen has a

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,790
session tomorrow on women in technology. I really highly recommend it.

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,939
We try to measure these things in real time and we have real numbers associated with that.

00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:05,049
Kabs is one of our solutions architects. He's a senior developer on the way to SA.

00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,720
What do our SAs get measured on? Estimation of projects.

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,189
Are those projects accurately estimated? We do a lot of fixed bid or RFP responses,

00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:22,279
but even during sprints are you able to achieve the things that you're planning during that

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,850
job process. Those are important for us, so are those estimates

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,170
realistic, and are they being hit? Correct architectural solutions.

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,549
That's a KPI, so how do we measure that? We measure that by defect counts.

00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:42,100
We take a look at QA duration and QA process. Are those things bouncing around a lot?

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,749
And then we have a number of quality of code delivered.

00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,769
We're looking at the number of defects in the warranty period.

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:54,749
We take a look at the feedback that our developers are providing.

00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:58,509
Before you commit, you have to get reviewed, right Dougie?

00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,029
So we take a look at all of these things and try to get numbers around that.

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:09,029
Again, Dougie, I didn't expect you to be here, but I'm just using you as an example.

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,989
Don't take it personally. What do your developers get estimated...?

00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,739
Yes. What are your key measurements?

00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:25,649
So I'm going to ask for the internet audience, that's going to happen afterwards, I'm going

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,429
to pass my mic. What are measures that you use to evaluate developers?

00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:37,429
-Okay, so right now we are using the... How can I say this in English? Let me check.

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,519
We are measuring our performance through the pipeline of our agile process, so we are trying

00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:55,569
to measure quality, I guess bugs in the code that is delivered.

00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:05,559
We also measure the estimation, like you guys, and also the time that we have to get the

00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:19,129
result of development of delivery, so it's something like if we understand the expectations

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:32,059
of our clients, I think it's like an early indicator of the

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,499
quality we are trying to deliver. -That's cool.

00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:42,499
I'm going to try some Q and A. I'm actually really curious on how you achieve those key

00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:49,139
measures, right? Because that's sometimes hard to measure.

00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,779
-How do we measure? Well, there are a lot of things we measure.

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:02,779
It depends on the company, the maturity level the company gives for the project.

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Because we work with CMMI maturity levels, so I've worked in projects of five maturity

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,230
levels and three, and it carries a lot of weight with that maturity level.

00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:29,489
We do code reviews, depending. Some would like standard already.

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,540
We agree with the client the number of bugs that we go with releases.

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:49,790
For us, it's like first internal standards and then agreements with the client.

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,879
-That's cool. Yeah, CMMIs are a really interesting model.

00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,389
That's been around for years and years. It's really cool.

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,429
Anybody else? It seems like we're pretty aligned with what

00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:08,060
we're looking at. I know one thing that we also keep track,

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,920
like administratively, it's an administrative part of us, is are we submitting the things

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,750
that our developers hate to do, time sheets? Keep track of whether those are complete on

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,680
a weekly basis from everybody, the entire company.

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,510
We also do support, right? So we measure a lot of things around support.

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,380
Some of this stuff that you see on this slide and the next one is borrowed from a call center

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,350
we take a look at. We have SLA, so service level agreements,

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,780
with our clients around SLA, so we talk about whether we're hitting those.

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,580
So response, right? In a typical call center, when you submit

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,680
a ticket you're measured against whether you hit that response.

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,640
You have a massive call center, so abandon rate.

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
People get through their issues, so the same thing here.

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,490
Do people actually stick with asking their issue?

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,640
How long do they wait until they get somebody where they can submit it?

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,830
Another call center things is average speed to answer.

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,770
We also take a look at do we respond to the particular problem?

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,840
Response time. Again, another call back.

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,320
Those are really call center issues, but they do apply to support, to the way that we do

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,620
support. Of course, resolution, right?

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,250
Just because we have an SLA that says with this critical of an issue you have to answer

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,530
with this many hours, there's also a resolution. That's even more important.

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,990
I mean, it's nice to have somebody say, "I got it. I know your problem," but it's nicer

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,660
to say, "Okay. I understand your problem, and here's your solution."

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,660
So we take a look at that, whether we are getting those issues closed within the time

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,660
we promise our clients. Of course it's really important to see whether

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:02,660
we have tickets that are re-opened, and that also gets tracked to the person who is closing

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,180
those tickets and the people managing those. There are lots and lots of other support metrics.

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,680
We want to provide high client satisfaction around support.

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,970
That's a really big part of our business, so we take a look at things like planned or

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,680
unplanned time. We take a look at whether we show...

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,870
We trend that over time. We try to see differences.

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:38,870
So we know, and this is what is very interesting, this topic of wait queue and how busy your

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:48,660
team is. We try to predict how much unplanned work

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,280
we're going to get on a weekly basis and then go back to some of this.

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,000
We don't keep track of all of these things, but just to give you an idea of all the different

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,960
measures that can be taken at a call center. Of course in project planning we use JIRA,

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,960
so we're starting to employ more and more types of measurements in terms of our projects,

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:18,930
and we do both agile and fixed bid, so we take a look at the burn down rate, whether

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,050
we have our budget being used versus the number of features that are being completed.

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,360
We take a look at open bugs, so all of these things.

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,440
We just recently adopted JIRA, so it's making it pretty easy for us to take a look at, you

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,000
know, are we in sprints, are we ahead of budget, under budget?

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,380
Again, going back to time reporting. It's pretty key.

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,740
Actually, it's not only important to measure those on a micro scale on a sprint or an issue

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,260
or an estimation, but then to kind of pull up and take a look at it.

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:59,260
I don't know if you guys had this experience before, but we came to a project where a client

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,120
of ours just wanted a little bit of help, and this was a large project.

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:12,190
They'd been working on it for over a year. And we said, "Sure, we'll take a look at it."

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,130
We took a look at it, and we sent one of our project managers to kind of do a deep dive,

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,870
and they used JIRA. And they said, "We just need a little bit

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,350
of help because we want to finish it in a month."

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,910
And we said, "All right. Let's take a look at this."

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,170
So we looked at all their tickets, and we said, "All right. So are these estimates correct?"

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,140
"Yes." These hundred or thousand issues there, whatever

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,370
number of issues that are outstanding. All of these estimates are correct.

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,310
And we said, "Well, that's interesting. Are you increasing your team?"

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,700
"No, no, no. We just want a little bit of help."

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,600
So we said, "All right. You're communicating that you're going to get done in a month to

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,650
your stakeholders." "Yes, we are."

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,150
"Well, if you're not increasing your team, and your estimates are correct, that means

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,920
that you have six months that you can complete those estimates with your current team."

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,170
And then it was like, whoa, their stakeholders are totally blindsided by this, so it's good

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,780
to roll that stuff up, not just look at it on a micro level.

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Yes, you had a question. -Are you using JIRA with sprints for service

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,270
desk? For support teams? -That's a very good question.

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,350
It is a little bit outside of what I'm talking about here, but yes, we are using JIRA service

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,350
desk, and actually we just transitioned there, so I don't have a full set of results there.

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:44,810
-For the team [inaudible] sprints [inaudible] -Yeah, so this is a great discussion because

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,570
there's a lot of measurement around support. For example, JIRA has a service desk.

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,160
JIRA is a tool, in case you guys haven't heard of it.

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,960
It's a great tool by Atlassian, and it has a lot of plug-ins, including BitBucket

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,030
and all these other things, and we've adopted it recently.

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,440
One of the nice premises around it is that it keeps track of the SLAs, so if you establish

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,950
SLAs, service level agreements, with your clients, you can say, "Okay, a high-level priority

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,120
issue, I'm going to address it in, let's say, five hours, ten hours," whatever you agreed

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,000
to do, whatever your capacity is. And then you can see how quickly you need

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,910
to react to that issue before it crosses the SLA, right?

00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,920
So the question is: How do we use it? I can have that conversation with you a little

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,050
bit later. Actually, my support director is running this,

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:45,070
and I'm not that familiar with it, but I can tell you what I know afterwards.

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,310
In terms of project reporting, of course we take a look at our big projects. We analyze

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:54,300
issues, how many are high, medium, low, and this is one of those metrics that's really

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,430
key in making that happen and that you can report back to your stakeholders what a likelihood

00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,010
is that something is going to succeed or not. These are all great, and we implement them

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,020
in our daily lives, and then we also do a lot of retrospective so we can learn from

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,190
those things, how much time we spent on projects. Where do we spend our projects?

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,940
So we look at like this. We did this a while ago, but, you know, this

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,320
is a pretty highly focused development project. We actually developed for like 57%.

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,470
The rest of it was spent in other activities, and this was like a development project.

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:34,470
So retrospectives are important for future ability to estimate and lessons learned and

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,360
being able to do a better job on future projects. Also take a look at for capacity planning, looking at

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,770
how much burn down you have per developer. This is another small project.

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:51,100
As you can see, this is pretty old, but retrospective estimation.

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:58,050
So keeping track of time and what your time is spent on is important for us.

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,370
We're doing all these things, and we felt like there's something that's still missing,

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:09,370
an important part that we wanted to capture.

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,790
Quality is really hard to measure, and client

00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,290
satisfaction we thought was pretty hard to measure.

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:22,800
So we thought about this and we started doing some research, and we really, really found

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,100
some great things. I'm going to talk to you about this for the

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:32,100
rest of this session and why we made this a key part of what we do on an everyday basis.

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,720
We made a decision late last year to focus on key numbers, but less numbers, and make

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:49,110
the company goal to focus on one number. We started doing some more research around

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,140
client satisfaction and how we can measure that and how we can do better, and some really

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,760
interesting things came up when I was looking at this, so I just want to share those with

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,760
you for those of you that are running your businesses and companies.

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,550
While I didn't love it, because customer complaints usually come at a time like right before I'm

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,270
giving a presentation at DrupalCon or right when I've traveled for 20 hours and I just

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,600
want to hit the pillow, but I need to hit that...

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,060
But those are really valuable, so I didn't not not like them, right?

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,850
Why? So just like a bug, I was at a MySQL

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,140
conference many, many years ago, and a keynote said the most valuable thing all the developers

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,140
can give me is a reproducible bug, right? A client complaint has, by some pretty decent

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,250
research here, many other clients would never bother to say that.

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,530
If a client raises their hand and says, "Hey, I have a problem with X, Y, and Z," especially

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,230
if it's tied to a process, we try to stop everything, as you guys stop the line, and

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,610
try to figure out what that is, because behind that there are many silent voices, and that

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:04,370
means that we need to address it immediately. Another interesting thing: 2% increase in

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,120
customer retention is the same as decrease in cost by 10%.

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,360
I'm going to talk a little bit more about that, but that's great, right?

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,630
So if you're running a business or you're running a team, or you're responsible for

00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:19,490
PNL, making your clients happier is basically like cutting costs.

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,960
How many of you guys had problems flying here or had some issues?

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,580
Yeah. Did you tell people about that? Yeah. Hell, yeah. Right?

00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,840
I complain about travel all the time. Talk to Dries, he's like, "Aw, this airport..."

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,570
Unhappy clients will tell many, many, many more people about a bad experience, but happy

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,580
clients may not. So another goal that we have is not to just

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,580
make happy clients. Make really happy clients. Make them feel like they need to tell your

00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:01,180
story. The other thing that we also are starting

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,660
to focus on is that... This can be a tough thing in engineering, right?

00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,059
Because we deliver a project on time. We deliver it on budget.

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:18,309
We deliver everything the client asked for, and they're still not happy. What?

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:24,420
Well, there's an emotional part of interacting with another human being that needs to be

00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,380
satisfied as well. For us, a lot of the feedback that we received

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,820
was really important. It didn't really have to do around... The

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,480
areas of improvement, not many of them had to do around code quality.

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
It was perceived very high. The value was perceived high.

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,360
It's really about that emotional connection. It may be difficult for engineering in a software

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:59,600
team, especially me who loves numbers. How do you make that emotional connection?

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,600
It's key, but it really does matter. By the way, notice this one, right?

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,309
You can charge more if you provide better service.

00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,090
They will not walk away if you charge more. They'll be happier because they want better

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,490
quality service. I don't know how much money or time you guys

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,490
spend on marketing, but it costs. We haven't done this. We should do this, but I wonder if it's six

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,330
or seven times. It costs a lot of time and money to acquire

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,710
a new customer. If you really break it down, the amount of marketing, blog writing, your

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,390
website, if you have a marketing person. Basically all they're in charge of is acquiring

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,059
new customers. How many customers do you get? Divide that

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,230
by the salary. How much time do you spend on the phone negotiating

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,860
your contract? All of those things, a lot of money.

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,720
Keeping that customer, you just have to do a good job, right?

00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,390
It really does make a lot of sense. Another fun fact I found during my research

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,480
is that, and I think Seth Godin wrote this cool book and it says all marketers are liars.

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,900
Well, they're not liars. They should be telling a good story,

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:18,860
but people tend to believe people they know. The blue line here is the percent of folks

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,270
you trust completely. The number one here is recommendations from

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,650
the people that you know. So if you tell me that Lufthansa or Austrian Air

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,809
or whatever it is that you flew here is terrible, I'll probably avoid it.

00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:39,640
But if I read it that they're great on a flier, I'll probably not believe it as much as I

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,830
believe you, but I don't know you. Anyway, word of mouth, right?

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,059
Your customer, keep them happy. They'll give you more business.

00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,440
I hope I've convinced you that this is really important.

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,010
As a business we really made a decision to focus on this, but this talk is about measurement,

00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,920
not client satisfaction, so how do you measure client satisfaction?

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,920
What are we doing to do that?

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Who here has heard of NPS? Net promoter score?

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,120
From me, I told you I weigh myself five times a day, I measure my sleep, walk, whatever.

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,220
I like to have a number around that. Somebody found a way to basically measure

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,900
client satisfaction. This is Frederick Reichheld--I think that's

00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,970
how you pronounce his name--and he wrote this up in Harvard Business Review more than 10

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,890
years ago. He basically did research on surveys and which

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,170
surveys are most effective, and he found that one company in particular was doing a one-question

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:54,420
survey, and they were using that survey to apply to their practices.

00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,570
They were more successful than these other companies.

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,990
How many times do you get a survey that goes on for pages and pages and pages, right?

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,480
First of all, you never complete those, and second of all, how do you do the analysis

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:12,480
on it? I'm just going to do a time check.

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Okay. He found that asking this one question provided

00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,650
so much value to this company that they were ahead of their competitors, so he then took

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,900
this question at the time and applied it to companies who are growing, companies who are

00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,510
staying steady, and companies that were losing market share.

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,770
Based on this one question of their clients--he asked for permission--he noticed that the

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:46,150
companies who have a high score on this one question were in a growth category.

00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:52,250
Clients were giving high points for that one question and were also growing, so there's

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:58,630
a correlation between having great customer service, through answering this question,

00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,090
and business growth. That's basically an NPS, so the question is:

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,820
How likely is it that you would recommend our company, product, or service to a friend

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,350
or a colleague? That's essentially that question.

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:20,350
You include one more text box for some input. But that has to tie to a number, right?

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,690
We take a look at the number of people who answer a nine or a ten. That' means they're

00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,340
extremely happy. Not just like an eight or a seven.

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:35,120
How likely are you to recommend somebody else to see this talk on a scale of one to ten?

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,720
An eight? Nah. A nine or a ten?

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,460
That means I did a great job. Five, six? You're just being kind to me. It

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,610
sucks, basically, right? You're a detractor.

00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,880
That's basically what it means. What it does is, the net promoter score basically

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,059
throws out the seven and eight. The sevens and eights don't count.

00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:01,470
It takes the nines and the tens and subtracts all the people who gave you a zero through

00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,080
a six, and it gives you a net promoter score. That one score... It's actually a really widely

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,899
adopted measure. There are many companies now that are building online businesses that help you measure

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:16,239
this stuff. And it gives you an idea of how well you do

00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:23,239
from a customer, client satisfaction perspective. Basically we started adopting this, and we

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,989
really started thinking about our philosophy of, yes, we measure a lot of things in terms

00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,179
of building our projects. We're developers. We're project managers.

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,579
We provide value. We try to partner up with our clients.

00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:43,139
We have to provide value to our employees. But in the end, we wanted to have a number

00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:50,139
around how satisfied are our clients. I gave a similar talk to an all hands team

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:58,349
meeting, and very quickly everybody kind of saw the value of this, and we started talking

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:02,819
about how happy are our clients. How are they responding?

00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:07,890
And we're tying the NPS... I don't know if you guys remember back. The net promoter score

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:14,890
is tied to our project managers' evaluation, so most of the field folks have an NPS score.

00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:22,170
Of course, I have an NPS score, as the entire company reflects our ability to deliver client

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,200
satisfaction, but it drives down to everyone who interacts with our clients.

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,869
We're looking at taking this... We can't over-poll our clients.

00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:34,849
We're looking at having interactive measures and a reset, and we're looking to obviously

00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,440
continually improve on that number. We want to generate more promoters.

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,989
We want to generate fans who are going to tell other potential clients or other potential

00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:51,539
employees or other folks how great we do, and that's started to become part of our culture.

00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:56,170
What's our NPS? What are we doing to provide better customer satisfaction?

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:03,170
Yes, question. -I'm not a manager or anything. I'm a developer,

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,609
but my question is simply, this statistic that you take, it seems like something you

00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:16,999
can only ask once to a client, or is it something you can repeat every year.

00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:20,589
How do you manage existing clients? If your client base is small, but you had a lot of

00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:24,859
existing projects and continual projects, how do you measure this if it's something

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:29,349
that seems like you can only ask once? -Yeah, that's a great question.

00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:33,989
There's a small industry around best practices for net promoter score polling.

00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:39,910
Yes, you're right. First of all, statistically speaking your sample size has to be really

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,749
big to get a true, true NPS. We don't have that luxury.

00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:50,069
We have 50 or so projects, let's say, going on or 100 projects going on every time, and

00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:53,210
you multiply that by the number of people that we interact with.

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,710
You don't get that great of a statistical number.

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,799
The other question, very good question, is: How often do you poll?

00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:07,589
So we're looking at resetting that. According to best practices for NPS, you're

00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:12,880
not supposed to poll more than six times every six months, so if you keep on polling your

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,980
clients, they'll just get tired of it. It's like, "Yes, you still suck" or "Yes,

00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,329
you're still amazing. Thank you very much," right?

00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:23,539
Or "I don't care." Every six months, the other thing that we're

00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:30,539
doing, because we tie this number to our team members' evaluations, right?

00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:37,900
So if Karen gets a really high number, we're going to try to tap into that secret and see

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,299
what she is doing better than some of the other folks that may not have that high NPS.

00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:49,640
We have a concept of continual polling, so as we bring new projects on or we have new

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,569
folks that are coming on board or we have new experiences, we incrementally poll.

00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:59,989
Now, we understand that's not... Again, the statistical variance doesn't give

00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:06,989
us that much, but it's better than nothing. We started looking at understanding better

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,700
how we can deliver on that quality, on a high score.

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,640
We take a look at four areas of our service, and that is:

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,569
What is that perfect service? We've been told nobody's perfect, things break,

00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:37,549
you know, redundancy. Nothing's really perfect.

00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:44,549
We understand that, yet we try to provide a service that is reasonable within a foreseeable

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,869
framework of instances. We try to set better expectations during the

00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:58,230
sales process. We have a re-onboarding during the project

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,589
manager introduction if we have a new project. And then we do certain toll gates, or we try

00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:09,589
to do certain toll gates during projects to see whether we're still delivering.

00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:18,829
Delivering in a caring, friendly manner. Maybe as engineers 

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
we may not be so great at this

00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:28,539
always, and I guess I'm speaking of my former self as a former developer many, many, many

00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:35,539
years ago. First of all, there's an emotional intelligence

00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,650
in business course on Coursera that's really, really good.

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,210
It basically talks about your attitude and how you interact with people, and people can

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,230
really tell. Basically, the biggest takeaway from this

00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,299
course that I took is that people can really tell when you're bullshitting them.

00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:55,880
When you're not really happy to deal with that client, they know that you don't like them.

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,529
They really do know, and one of the things that's interesting about me is I really love

00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:04,880
my clients. I love all of our clients.

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,950
I'm humbled by the fact they choose to spend thousands and thousands of dollars and time

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,170
and bet on the fact that we're going to get them a promotion, get them what they want,

00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,539
help them achieve their business goals, whatever it is.

00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,339
So we talk about partnering up with our clients and seeing what they're trying to achieve

00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:26,989
and hopefully also buying into that, like really getting in what they're needs are,

00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,470
whether the fact is they're totally disorganized and...

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:37,220
Well, all of our clients are super organized, perfect communication, always show up on time.

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,059
They know what they want always. We're just here to help them get this in a

00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:50,059
really caring manner, so we say that we want to become partners with our clients.

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:56,609
We really do, and it's really important that we also emotionally get involved and care

00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:58,890
about that. We show that.

00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,819
That's really a big part of the win. In a timely fashion.

00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:11,589
This is also another interesting thing, right? In a timely fashion may not necessarily mean

00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:15,799
to a client what it means to you. Obviously there are some expectations to

00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:18,809
be setting. There are no projects that can be completed

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,269
tomorrow, so you have to set those expectations, but you also have to take a look at what we're

00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:26,989
doing and how we're doing it and see whether that's timely.

00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:31,390
That's another key part. Backed by an effective problem-resolution.

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,930
So are we empowering our teams to enable them to solve that problem.

00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:42,220
If something happens, do we have a communications process and a process where we can mobilize

00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:49,220
and solve that problem? The perfect service is within normal operating

00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,339
circumstances. When something bad happens, how do you react?

00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:04,339
From our experience, some of our best clients that have great retention, and we always want

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:11,109
to make our client lifers. We call them lifers. We want them to be with us forever and ever.

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:16,390
We had major problems. I can't even tell you how many screw-ups we

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:22,920
had, like major, major issues, and we basically stopped what we were doing and said, "Yeah,

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,229
we totally screwed up. Here's what we're going to do to fix it."

00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:31,900
And we mobilize and we get things done, whether we delete files, whether we lose the back-up,

00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:38,849
whatever it may be, and we communicate and fix it, and they see that an effective problem-resolution

00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:43,660
process is in place, and they can trust us not to abandon them when we own a problem,

00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,259
and they've been great. We try to deliver value.

00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:52,390
We take a look at the timelines and what we're trying to do, what the client's trying to

00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:58,279
achieve, not just what they're telling us. We try to break down different types of projects

00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:01,869
by teams and different types of projects by project managers so that we can deliver to

00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:06,180
what the client is actually expecting. Establishing a relationship is really important,

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,910
not just with the project managers, but at the technical level we establish relationships

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,710
between those folks and account managers and myself.

00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:18,130
I try to have a relationship with most of our stakeholders.

00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:24,349
We do focus on automation and testing, continuous deployment.

00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:31,349
That helps us in terms of setting expectations [inaudible] time in deployment.

00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,029
In terms of the timeline, we try to destroy Silos, so have our system engineering team

00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:42,859
work with our developers, be able to quickly respond, empower teams.

00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:49,859
So whether it's giving credit or whether it's spending more time, our teams are empowered

00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,739
to make those connections with their clients and get that client satisfaction higher.

00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,269
Culture. So this is tough, right? Because Drupal developers

00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:08,269
are really hard to find, and some developers, some folks, some people just think that they're

00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,589
always right, and if they can't embrace that culture that says, "No, we're really here

00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:19,829
for the client because that's really what drives our business and what is important,"

00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:24,440
I think it's better to say "goodbye." If they don't have a good culture fit, it

00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,589
may hurt you in the long run to have that person than not.

00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:34,509
I borrowed this from Scott Massey. He's at Pantheon.

00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:41,499
He runs their support department. We also try to do this, so we always say that

00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:48,499
there's a greater project risk if we don't have clarity, so complexity is not the risk.

00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,640
It's a lack of clarity, whether accurately responding to whatever it is we're trying

00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,049
to do, executing correctly, and, of course, having empathy for the client.

00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:03,089
Those are some of the things that we're doing. We measure a lot of different things throughout

00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:08,220
our different types of projects and support and our personnel and time and where the time

00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,529
goes. Ultimately, one of the things that we're focusing,

00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:16,049
and it's starting to work really well, is that client satisfaction or net promoter score.

00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:19,869
So having that mindset. Are we doing things that are going to increase that?

00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:25,640
And we have a cheesy theme this year, and that's "put yourself in your client's shoes,"

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,119
so shoes is our theme the first part of the year.

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,170
What are our clients thinking? Because we're going to ask them to see how

00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:41,170
likely it is they're going to recommend us. That concludes my talk on measurement.

00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:51,140
I hope that was enlightening and helpful. I have already posted these slides on SlideShare.

00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:57,059
That's my Twitter handle. I'm going to tweet that as soon as we're done,

00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:03,390
and I wanted to open up the floor to questions. I'd love to hear how you guys are doing, and

00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:09,279
somebody give me a time check, by the way. I'm sure I have... I had 45 minutes, I understand.

00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:16,279
45 minute talking and 15 minute Q and A, right? In terms of time, I'm just two minutes over.

00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:22,660
That's pretty accurate. Okay, so Q and A, and I think we can go...

00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,749
Have they been letting... -[inaudible]

00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,779
-Okay, so we have like 15 minutes for Q and A.

00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:33,779
-I have a question. This is regarding some figures that you presented, but I didn't want

00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:37,979
to interrupt you. I noticed that, for instance, you presented

00:46:37,979 --> 00:46:44,460
that you measure the meeting time that you have, for instance.

00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:51,460
Also, I noticed that you showed that you work under sprints, so I am assuming that you work

00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:01,339
under an agile approach, so how do you tie those kind of metrics if you are working under

00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:05,339
an agile approach? I mean, it seems to me that it's pretty tough,

00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,029
you know? I don't know if I'm explaining myself.

00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:14,880
-Yeah, I totally understand. So we have basically three types of projects,

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,880
right? And it's important for us to recognize that they're different, and so we have support,

00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:29,069
and that's a completely different department just around support.

00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:33,529
We do measure time there. We don't have an all-you-can-eat type model

00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:38,039
or basically a gym membership model where you sell 2,000 memberships, especially after

00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:40,529
Christmas and New Years, right? Like everybody's like, "Yeah, I'm going to go to the gym in

00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:43,710
January." They sell 2,000 memberships, and it only holds

00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,380
200 people, so if everybody showed up they would be screwed.

00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,630
We don't do all-you-can-eat. We set time aside, and we charge our clients

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,319
for everything because we provide value at every meeting.

00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:00,799
We keep track of time there. And then, yes, on a development project, which

00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:05,039
is a different department, agile is a little bit different.

00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,450
We take a look at or we try to check once in a while to make sure those projects don't

00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:16,239
exceed what we expect, but the first time we did, when we first time looked at a fixed

00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,960
bid project and we took a look at the time of the meetings, it was like, wow, that was

00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,469
huge. We try telling our clients, "Come prepared.

00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:27,339
Come on time. Let's try to make this efficient because it is costing you."

00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:31,339
So if you show that to a client in agile... You know, we have a problem, for example,

00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:34,869
and we say, "Look, this is how much time we're spending in times and this is costing you,"

00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:38,249
it's like "okay." We have some clients that just really only

00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,920
want to have 15 minute meetings with us. We're like, "Great!"

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,700
Does that answer your question? -Yeah.

00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:52,579
-Talking about the measurement and about the amount of project management, for example,

00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:57,569
you need or the amount of meetings you need, do you show these numbers to the clients only

00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,369
afterwards after the project, or do you have checks in between where you say, "Okay, we

00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:08,369
are not on track, on budget, and this is why"? -Karen can tell you about this for hours and

00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:15,479
hours and hours. She had an interesting project just recently.

00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:23,279
First of all, our philosophy is to be completely transparent, so all of our clients have full

00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:27,339
access to our time tracking in JIRA. Every one of our team members is required

00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:31,249
to put in their time at the end of the day. We have a call-out when it's not done at the

00:49:31,249 --> 00:49:38,249
end of the week, so they get called out and say, "Hey, everybody else did it but you."

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,150
They have visibility into that. I don't have metrics on how many clients actually

00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,969
do look at that. Like I said before, when we pointed it out

00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:54,969
to this one client, like when we have overages on support and they want to get a detailed

00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,289
list, everything is in there. That has to be communicated internally also,

00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:05,299
right? Because we share comments, and we want to make sure that those comments are respectful.

00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:11,299
Does that answer your question? -Partly.

00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:17,979
-Partly. Our clients are aware of that. Obviously, if you're working in this business you understand

00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:23,460
this time is there. We haven't made it a practice of saying, "This

00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,190
is how much time we're spending in meetings." We don't break it down into those areas.

00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:33,420
Maybe we'll try it. -Thank you.

00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:39,059
-Sure. Anybody else? You had some questions before.

00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:46,059
-In your opinion, what is the importance to have one account manager and technical account

00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:55,759
manager? Because in my company, we just have an account manager and sometimes we have problems

00:50:56,509 --> 00:51:03,509
because we don't have a technical account manager to serve this customer in this time.

00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:10,329
-Yeah, that's a really good question. We have to take a look at it in context, in

00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:17,329
terms of context for what kind of project it is and the size of the overall client.

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,930
For example, there are clients that I have a monthly check-in with them because they

00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:29,509
are a very key, strategic client. We have recently introduced the concept of

00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:36,509
account managers and project managers, so we have account managers who check in on the

00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:41,009
emotional health of the client, the project progress, and have an escape valve.

00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:48,009
If you had a project manager and you're basically in the trenches, sometimes if you have a conversation

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:57,420
with the stakeholders or with the client's project manager, they may tell you something

00:51:57,569 --> 00:52:01,259
that they may not tell your project manager. It's just a different relationship.

00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:04,930
I think the other part of the question was you have your project managers who may not

00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:11,369
be so technical, and you have solutions architects or developers sit in meetings where sometimes

00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:17,599
they're completely non-relevant, but sometimes you really, really want that technical resource

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,640
on that. I don't have a great answer for you on that.

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,219
I know this problem exists. I know that there's a need.

00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:32,119
Obviously we need to solve that. On one hand, we don't want to waste people's

00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:38,180
time and our client's money. On one hand, sometimes it's really valuable

00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,759
and it really gets that, what we talked about, time to solution or time to resolution, especially

00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:49,440
on the support side, it really helps that. We've seen a number of things. We have a 24/7

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,009
support team, so we have teams kind of around the world, and we notice that on certain client

00:52:56,009 --> 00:53:01,900
interactions it does help to have that technical team, at least in the same time zone, so that

00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:07,489
was really helpful. We're trying to basically listen to our clients,

00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,799
and when we sense there's a technical person needed, do it.

00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:17,799
We don't have a hard rule that says, "Every two weeks you have a half an hour with a technical

00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,211
solutions architect." Not yet. Not yet.

00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,189
-[inaudible] -Sure. My pleasure.

00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,601
Any other questions? Yeah, sure. I love questions.

00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,979
-You said you do both new projects and support projects, and you have two different departments

00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,930
for that. At some point, there's a break.

00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:46,930
At some point, the project is launched. When does it actually go to support?

00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:54,339
Is it a matter of size? Can it go back to new project at a certain size of a new project

00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:03,769
coming up or of a new development? As you said, it's about building a personal

00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:09,029
relationship, so do these relationships break?

00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,999
Do you build up new ones? Do you leave them the same?

00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,420
Many questions, sorry. -No, these are really, really good questions.

00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,430
These are very, very important questions that we have asked ourselves and are still asking

00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,140
ourselves. You know, we try to have a hard definition

00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,210
around what goes to development and what goes to support.

00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:32,460
We actually have very complementary skills in terms of technical capability on our development

00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,099
team and our support team. We have great developers in solutions architect

00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,630
and development, and we have great developers in solutions architects and our support

00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,109
team. The approach is a little bit different, and

00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:49,109
we have a really big, what you could consider continuous development projects and a support team.

00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:57,430
The way we internally define it right now is when we have a project that has a start,

00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:04,430
and an end date is in development. When we have a project that has maybe a monthly

00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:11,819
budget or has a backlog of features and security updates and some other things, we move them

00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:14,729
to support. That's how we differentiate.

00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:19,309
At first we thought it was just going to be the size, but then we noticed that our support

00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:24,950
team is really well equipped to have those ongoing meetings without an end date, and

00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:30,569
also we managed security stuff and sometimes internal infrastructure and DevOps, and we

00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:34,930
build it up for our clients and train them on the support, and they have other developers

00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,479
internally, and we have other dev shops that are working with them.

00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:45,239
Our support team is really kind of well trained and equipped to deal with that, whereas our

00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:47,559
developers are just like, "We're going to hammer this away and we're going to do a great

00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:53,509
job and we're going to crush this project and deliver on time, on budget, and it's going

00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:55,569
to be great." Maybe that's the only difference.

00:55:55,569 --> 00:56:01,479
Then the other question was: How do we hand that off in the relationship?

00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:06,009
That's really key. That's a really big concern because we talked

00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:10,619
about, we try to build a great relationship, so sometimes the account managers help a little

00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,150
bit, so they'll help bridge that loss of a relationship.

00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:19,489
"Don't worry. It's going to be okay. I'll introduce you to your new project manager

00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:25,009
that's just as great as the other one." The account manager helps a little bit.

00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:29,029
We do have a process where we hand off. Really we do have to break, and we announce

00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:33,039
this and say, "Look, you know, the project is going to be delivered here. There's a warranty

00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,420
period, and of course we're going to be available for some questions. We're going to do our

00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,219
best to do a transition knowledge transfer, but this is going over to support."

00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:54,120
-Hi, I'm a developer, I started at my company as a project manager, and you

00:56:54,859 --> 00:57:01,809
said earlier that there is this emotional connection.

00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:07,719
I'm having that problem, so how do you develop that emotional connection with the customer?

00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:14,719
I think it's very interesting.

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,640
-I think emotional connection is most related

00:57:22,029 --> 00:57:27,660
to how much you want to do for your client, so, yes, it has to do by putting yourself

00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:34,660
in the client's shoes and trying to think about how to make him happy, but mostly it's

00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:43,440
based on communication, because when communications go wrong, then things escalate very quickly.

00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:50,869
Like if you didn't tell him that his budget is almost gone or you didn't tell him that

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,849
maintenance is going to be at a certain hour and his site is going to be down or things

00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:04,849
like that. When you don't do that. You know that, but sometimes you don't tell it at the

00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:11,440
right time, then it becomes a big deal. That affects your relationship a lot, so the

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,440
first thing to work on--communication--and really try to keep a bright outlook of life

00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:25,789
when you talk to them, really. -Yes, to me, most of the time it's really

00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:30,430
easy. I really love our clients, and I care about

00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,900
them, and I want them to succeed. I think about the fact that, whether it's

00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,839
an owner who's paying you out of their own pocket and it's their money, so they're going

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,989
to be really careful, or whether it's somebody who works in a multimillion-dollar company,

00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,869
like what do they want? Well, they want a raise.

00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:51,799
They want their projects to succeed, so I really try to put myself in their shoes, and

00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,819
I think about it all the time, and that's kind of how I interact with them.

00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:58,849
I talk to my clients all the time. I had an hour and a half conversation with

00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:04,670
a client of mine about some very personal things Saturday night while being totally

00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,869
late for a dinner that I've planned for months in advance.

00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:13,339
We interact very openly and honestly, and I feel that's my approach.

00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:19,019
I don't know whether that works for everybody else, but I think it's really important and

00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:22,559
I think in the end it shows that you care. Also when you make mistakes, and we make mistakes

00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,450
and we really work on it. You know, we dumped some AWS servers that

00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,569
were unrecoverable, and I got a call from a client.

00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:35,229
I was on vacation. I was like, "Here's the deal. I'm on vacation. The door's about to

00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:40,729
close. I'm with my family and a crying baby. I'm going to land in two and a half hours,

00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:43,489
and I'm going to call you in two and a half hours," and sure enough we landed, I handed

00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:46,329
the baby over to my wife, and then I'm like, "What's going on? How can we help you?"

00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:49,410
That helped. That was a really big investment for what
