Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Contribuyendo al core en tiempos de Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-02-10
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: develCuy
(english below)

De lo más sublime, loable y gratificante, es contribuir al core de Drupal. Aunque, siendo bueno el propósito, es siempre una causa en cuya lucha muy pocos han podido militar.

"Es culpa del tiempo" - dicen algunos - "cruento, pasa y no me deja contribuir". ¿No será que culpar al tiempo es solo una forma de engañarnos?

Creo mas bien, que los "Latinos Drupaleros" no nos hemos dado cuenta aún, que estamos en la misma orquesta, tratando de tocar una misma canción que solo pocos conocen, aunque bien han tratado de enseñarnos los pocos entendidos.

"¡Y acaso no hemos tocado la canción de los Meetups, Camps, Summits y hasta Drupalcon!" - dicen las voces de los mentores de la comunidad - ¡Claro que sí! ¡Mas acaso no hace falta que aportemos nuestras lineas al core de Drupal! "Sí... pero el tiempo, cruento, pasa y no me deja contribuir..." - repite un murmullo con voz quebradiza, como canción triste que todos saben y nadie quiere cantar.

¡Pues cambiemos la música!

"Es hora de contribuir, Es hora de contribuir, ..." - dice el coro

Ahora sí ¿te unes a la fiesta? ¡Pues ven a esta charla y vamos todos a codear!

-- En honor a el Gabo y su libro "El amor en los tiempos del cólera".

Contributing to core in times of Drupal 8

It is sublime, praiseworthy and rewarding to contribute to Drupal core. Although, being a good purpose, it is always a cause that not everyone is fighting.

...(to be translated)...

So let's change the song!

"It's time to contribute, it's time to contribute, ..." - chorus says

Would you like to join the party? ¡So come to this session and let's code together!

	00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,520
Good afternoon. My name is Fernando Paredes.

00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,125
 

00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:08,693
I'm going to talk about it.

00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,374
 

00:00:12,374 --> 00:00:12,883
Core conversation, Contributing to the core in Drupal 8 times.

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
 

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,311
A little information about me, 

00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:19,794
I've been in the community for some time now; I'm kind of Drupalosaurus.

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,360
I am fortunate to be sharing here with you, 

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
in the Latin America Drupal.com Conference.

00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,220
One may have done some things, and always thinks, 

00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,720
Now what?

00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,911
Where are we going to focus energy.

00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,456
I believe that energy should be focused on Drupal's Core.

00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
The title says Contribute to the core in Drupal 8 times.

00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:04,634
To me it means that "contribute" is not a word we like.

00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:06,380
It is a contribution, like a tax.

00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,209
In Peru, there is a Department of Contribution, or the Taxpayer.

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,380
If we put ourselves in that situation, we started badly.

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Perhaps, we say "there is no time".

00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,546
There is no time to contribute.

00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,386
I have many things to do, I have to work, I have a family.

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
And there are some issues.

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,140
If you see the case of Larry Garfield, who is going to be in a meeting tomorrow, see the case of Drees, 

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
They are busy people, don't you think?

00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:44,387
I don't think they have much time to lose.

00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,102
However, they are in the vein of contributing to the core.

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Why it is important to them?

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
And, why do they do it?

00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:55,561
It's a good question.

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
It is important that we begin to change the chip.

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,300
But, also, let's think a bit like community.

00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,817
A community is a group of beings who are united by a common mission.

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,920
So Drupal is a community.

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,700
We are united.

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
But I've been thinking that maybe we are not aware of why.

00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,491
Maybe we're all of us in this conference and those who could not come, because of interest in personal matters.

00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,882
Can be learning.

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
It can also be a work in Drupal is not bad.

00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,881
It's like family, each person has their things, but what makes us a family?

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
What makes us a community? What makes us a community is the mission we have in common.

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
First we will try to remove some paradigms, such as regionalization.

00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,681
The Latin American says I'm unique, for my food, or the place where I live, for many factors.

00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,044
The shapes, the accent.

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Speaking of the Drupal project, what we're focused on now, the core of Drupal,

00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,288
is a software project. 

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
We can not mix.

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
The community has a local context, has a regional context.

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,960
But the Drupal project is something global, 

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It is something we're all involved in.

00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,688
Each line of code that gets into the core serves us all.

00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
We have to think of a common unit that can unit us.

00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,078
And we are all responsible for getting Drupal afloat as a project.

00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,718
As citizens of this Drupal group, we have our right to free software.

00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,443
Using the software freely, publishing it, using it in business, providing services.

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Those are our rights but our duties begin on this.

00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,326
Keeping the project afloat.

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
What is the mission of Drupal?

00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,817
What is it that should unite us, thinking in the Drupal software project?

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
As Drees says, "Drupoal's mission is to develop a content management system, the leading open source".

00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,445
I know the mission began there.

00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,588
It is a vision that comes from the beginning, from the root.

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
I want you to share what they think.

00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,134
I want to pass the microphone to those who want to share, and tell me how they see the issue of community, how they see the issue of vision.

00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,497
And if you think that may be part of the project.

00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,506
Of the kernel, the core of Drupal. Let's see, who's interested?

00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,144
How are you, hello, I'm Ignacio Vanelli from Argentina.

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I've been working with Drupal for three or four years.

00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,526
You ask me if I see myself, it's one of the things that strengthens me.

00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
What I like about working with this technology.

00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,767
I remember that I was originally working with Linux, and how I came to Linux.

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Being that something the Drupal community has, the same as with the Linux community, open, trying to do something for others.

00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:16,348
Although it is Tech Odiki, the idea is that it is a good thing for everyone.

00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,178
In particular, that gets my attention a lot.

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
One of the things I'm trying to do is get involved more in the Drupal community.

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
 

00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,691
 

00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,191
Working a bit like a job outside of and within a Drupal Shop, sometimes not so much what you see is the core.

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
I think I see and think you can.

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,860
I lost the thread and resumed. 

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
What worries me is and I've seen a lot in the Linux community, and I think there are things the Drupal community can learn from the Linux community.

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
This is the need work together and try to to reduce the forts to a minimum.

00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,686
What worries me is the fort of Backdrop.

00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:15,732
I think it's good in some points, and it's bad in another.

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I would love that as a community we managed to achieve it, although there has been this decision, one way is to include it again.

00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,675
I'm afraid that is lost, the power of the community to go forward.

00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:41,514
I've seen with Genome and Linux, and for me it was terrible and I think that's one thing we have to learn.

00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,592
Do not close your eyes and say it does not happen.

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
See how it's done to remain a community and always have the same goals and the same desire to do things.

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
See what to do to work together.

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Who else would like to share? Recalling if one looks within that Drupal mission.

00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,974
It is the mission of making a system that is leading.

00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:17,043
Leading content management.

00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,861
We're talking about software.

00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,953
Let's leave the community a little bit for now.

00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,607
My name is Jose Luis Coello and I am from Colombia.

00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,639
I've known Drupal since version 5 about seven years ago.

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,970
At the company where I worked we developed the first media portal in Colombia, elespectador.com

00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,504
Two years later, the way of becoming active in the community again was participating in Drupal.com, 

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:09,829
go to see what was behind a page, forums, comments, were people, as we all are.

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,340
This way of strengthening ties.

00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,952
I am keen to get involved and contribute to the core of Drupal.

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
To contribute, you do not necessarily have to be, choose something you like and you're passionate about,

00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,145
and do it.

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
As the message conveyed in communities,

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,680
 

00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,139
I would like to wish I could do it, do it.

00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,823
Take the initiative and do it.

00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,717
In communities and in these events, you should not come and say that you already know, you already know.

00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,368
Keep an open mind to learn, and if you have something to share, share it too.

00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,311
It seems that there is an interest.

00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,079
I have this interest since maybe six years ago.

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,060
The thing is that it has not materialized.

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Honestly, you look at the ranking of contributions to Drupal and will encounter some surprises.

00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,231
This is voluntary.

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Not that hey, look, it's not a party or a competition to see who contributes more.

00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:39,297
It is only that was a reflection of how much Drupal offers me as a community, as software.

00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,383
I benefit, and how much I'm giving back.

00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,747
Free Software is all a circle, is a cycle.

00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,223
There is no software project without community, and the reverse also.

00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,205
I'll share a case.

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I told you at the beginning about Stan Drees, the project founder, he has a large company, etc.

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
There Is Larry Garfield who is a great software engineer who not only participates in Drupal,

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,540
but has a great profile in the PHP community.

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
And we can say that they are great characters.

00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,372
Which are in reality maybe different from ours.

00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,246
I'll share the story of Vijaya, he is different.

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,870
Vijaya Chandran is from India.

00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,866
He is in the top 15 in contributions to Drupal 8.

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Of the 2,500 people contributing to the project, he is in 15th place. 

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
He is next to Chatequis.

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,040
Great rock stars.

00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,781
Known, but perhaps it is not so.

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
What he teaches us.

00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,818
He was born in India, studied there. 

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,530
He became involved with Drupal since 2007, which is roughly the time that most of us here became involved.

00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,433
It is in a good ranking.

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
And then get involved with software project as a consequence of focusing on the core of Drupal.

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Meet new people, he develops.

00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,803
Learns a lot.

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
He now works for Capgemini. What is Capgemini?

00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,022
It is a small company with 120,000 employees, is in 40 countries and has 225 Drupalers.

00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,837
If Capgemini wanted, it could be a Drupal.com at any time.

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Just with Capgemeni employees.

00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:42,122
Or a camp.

00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,783
You know what the per capita income in India is.

00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,592
If a person from India comes to Peru, I have friends in India who come to Peru, Latin America, and Colombia.

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We will say that we are much better.

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Latin America is no longer a place where there is poverty, we are already emerging.

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
In India the story is not so.

00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,344
It is a very large country where there are many differences.

00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,239
Vijaya is an example of overcoming. 

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
He has no excuses to make.

00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,331
We can all have excuses. 

00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,425
Or I will say otherwise.

00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:28,977
Why contribute to the core of Drupal?

00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,636
I say perhaps, why help is not easy to answer.

00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,508
Because I am already using Drupal.

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
I have my business or I work for people.

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
There are other ways, I organize meetups, I do camps, I volunteer in Drupal.com.

00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,609
I have many things to do.

00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,824
Above the core, contribute and send patches.

00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:01,324
Or I've tried and it's boring.

00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,996
I fell asleep reading the manual, and the next day no longer remembered.

00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,725
Easy to answer.

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
But why do it?

00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,377
Why do I do it.

00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:24,748
I've done very little, although I could have done more.

00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,892
This is a self-criticism.

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
First each of you has to be born with his or interest.

00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,494
As the Drupal slogan says.

00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,153
Come for the software and stay for the community.

00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,908
I came because I loved Drupal as a framework.

00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:49,418
Then I met the community and that amalgamated me.

00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,395
Each came for a reason.

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Now it's time to take the next step.

00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,628
It's time to close the circle.

00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,825
Not that we do it, if we are just persistent,

00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,067
it will be part of us.

00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,560
The reason is to be part of me.

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,070
I contribute to the core because it is part of me.

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
You no longer have to say that they pay you, not that I do have time sometimes.

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,079
It is part of me.

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
It is a challenge.

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Where do we begin, and who wants to contribute?

00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,302
You're scared.

00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,941
We have to learn GIT, we must find the form to create an issue.

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
We have to write everything in English.

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,520
Have the courage to withstand criticism from people that are going to say your code is wrong.

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
And we have to adapt to the process, its requirements.

00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,377
When we wanted to start, we came out running.

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,650
We are not saying it's easy.

00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,364
There are many roadblocks.

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
They are roadblocks that are going to make us grow.

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
The more stones there are, the more material we will have to build our development.

00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:12,254
As professionals in Drupal.

00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,121
We want to be experts in Drupal.

00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,700
We want to reach the next level.

00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,859
We are talking about people who love technology.

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Build with those stones something better for ourselves.

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
And, in the meantime, it's good for the community.

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Are you excited to contribute?

00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,628
I see a lot of you are excited.

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,250
We will have the sprints, here's the program.

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Enter the page / sprints and we have a BoF on Tuesday at 5 pm in Salon Azaleas.

00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
I recommend that to you because we, the mentors, are going to be there, Katy will be, and she will explain how the process works.

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,999
A little guidance if you already know and want to help in this.

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
On Thursday there will be a general sprint.

00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Tomorrow at 3.45 we will do a demonstration of how things are going to happen in the sprint.

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
We will learn how to do things and then we will have a demonstration.

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Neither you nor I have come to a talk.

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
It is not to make you feel bad that you are not contributing.

00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,644
It is here to define, but you can ask at the registration desk where the sprints will be.

00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:46,436
Thursday, it will be here. 

00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:48,321
On Friday, it will be at a university.

00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,331
I want to conclude with a conversation between us.

00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:02,831
Since it was only an introduction, and some have told me their expectations.

00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:07,366
As each of us stated to see the rest of what we had discussed.

00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,653
If you look at your own history, your situation, and says, now that I know the story of Vijaya, do you think that you could do it?

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Do you think you could take that step?

00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,423
To choose the core as part of your life the fact of contributing.

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,050
There are others, backdrop, things we can worry about in the future.

00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:36,495
But now we're going to get into the core.

00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:40,176
And we will look into that, it's a small community.

00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,456
There are only 2,500 people.

00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,458
In the universe of approximately one million people.

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,740
Those involved in Drupal, who have a user account on Drupal.org

00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,939
No, millions.

00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,926
Exactly.

00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,472
It is a community of 2,500 people.

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
We'll get into that world.

00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,912
Only the core.

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Only Drupal 8.

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Sure, I'll pass the microphone so you can share.

00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,128
Let us try to see ourselves in that world.

00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:28,661
Each one, count on that.

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Before entering that world,

00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,196
I think the only thing one of those slides did was make noise.

00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,016
That said why not and many reasons.

00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,184
I think many of those reasons is not that it's a no,

00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,700
but is also a yes.

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
As you said at the beginning of the talk, there are many ways to contribute to the core.

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
If you are organizing meetups or camps,

00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,555
or if you are generating business over here, there is a person who says I am not a programmer.

00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:11,262
But you do business with Drupal, and have in mind to contribute to the core,

00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:11,762
people you pay you give them a chance.

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Because it is inside your mind.

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
It may not be you who launches lines of code,

00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,002
but you are encouraging and assisting.

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Whether organizing, paying, otherwise, these are all contributions which are also equally important.

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Without them, we could not.

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Totally, myself, you, others have organized camps. 

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's fine, brings a lot, creates a space.

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,580
And now we have to channel the core.

00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
If one thing is promoting, it is going to turn into an excuse to not do the other,

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
in the end, we lose the mission.

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Having an event where there are people, we will not necessarily improve the tool.

00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,249
It's that the people who are there, improve it.

00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,691
Have the goal that if you do an event, there will be a space with sprints to contribute to the core.

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
If you're hiring people, you have in mind to give them a space in time,

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,000
in their spaces to contribute.

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Or if you're hiring people, you have in mind to give a space in time on their projects to contribute.

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Make it something that is within and constantly doing something to contribute to Drupal.

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,260
That it be something you have in mind constantly to do to nurture life in Drupal.

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,670
Without contributing to the core, it would not exist.

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Let us return to the question.

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,280
How do we see ourselves?

00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Let's get inside the core.

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
There are only 2,500 people in the world who are doing something to make the core of Drupal 8.

00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,246
We believe we can take the next step.

00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,908
Let's make it part of us tp contribute to the core.

00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,923
Remember, contributing to the core is not necessarily programming.

00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,312
There is plenty of documentation, testing.

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,120
As Joaquín said: If you are within a company, identify the value it means to me now, the fact that Drupal has something.

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,620
 

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,620
What interests me in my line of business.

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Maybe Drupal has 80% of what I want.

00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,959
But the 1% that could be the difference, isnt there.

00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,131
Can my company add that 1%?

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Can I make that happen?

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
So now we are all involved.

00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,207
My name is Camilo Escobar.

00:22:58,207 --> 00:22:59,662
I'm Colombian.

00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:03,784
I have known Drupal since version 6.

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,340
This talk caught my attention because I intend on being part of the community.

00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,206
Knowing how I can actively participate.

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
I agree with what has been raised.

00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:28,974
Stop wishing for what is missing,

00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,645
or fail to point out to what is missing.

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Work so that this exists.

00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:45,032
Surely today I am going with a strong desire to participate.

00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:47,329
and start making my first contributions.

00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Nice to meet you; my name is Juan Esteban.

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
I do not remember exactly how long I've known about Drupal.

00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,053
I looked at my account, and I've had it since 2009.

00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:14,473
It was not in full since that time, 

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
when I saw the planned schedule for this Drupal.com, 

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
I saw that the sprints are on Thursday.

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
It is something that motivated me a lot, but I have never contributed to the core.

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I've always seen them as rock stars.

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I do not know how true it is, but as I said earlier,

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
but I want to contribute to Drupal because of what it has given me.

00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,683
That's why I'm here.

00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,554
And, to take advantage of everything that has been planned, 

00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,462
the talks for some knowledge to start making my contributions to the core.

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
My name is Alina, my Spanish is not good.

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I started contributing to Drupal core in 2013.

00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:39,323
I think I'm better contributing as developer.

00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,346
My name is Luis Eduardo Telaya.

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
I've known about Drupal for 3 years.

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
I have a great mentor, the exhibitor Fernando.

00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,015
He always encourages me and motivates us all,

00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
to go forward to fix some patches.

00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,363
To fix some bugs, and I would like to contribute more.

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
And try to support others.

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,589
I am very encouraged by my mentor and the community.

00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,917
I would to continue to support and give my best.

00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,119
I'm Joaquin Bravo.

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,429
I agree with a great deal of what Juan Esteban was saying.

00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,602
It seems like something for rock stars, exactly that.

00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
No that it is, ah, easy.

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
It is not easy.

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,425
But it makes you a better programmer.

00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:48,264
You finish highly enriched from the first steps.

00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:53,936
The first thing to do is read the issue q's and then learn a lot about how Drupal works.

00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,980
Then you see the process of how the discussions are made.

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
As decisions are made, and that is very rewarding.

00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,758
I want to try this patch and learn to implement patches.

00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,912
To use GIT.

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Then you learn to use testing.

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Every little step you take makes you a better programmer.

00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:19,857
It's really worth it.

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
If you wind up doing a comemeet, even if not, any step you take will make you much better.

00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,740
It really is worth it.

00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
I think that's the most important part.

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,950
I'm Renato Vasconcelos.

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,450
I have been contributing to the Drupal project for several years.

00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,118
I think one of the most important things we have to do,

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
as developers and working on open source projects

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,230
is contributing to code events.

00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,812
Thus, the project continues.

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
There is nothing like having a community work in order to keep evolving.

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,759
I think it's the most important part.

00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,180
I see this as one of the most important things to do.

00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,660
I always try to contribute and help people so we can go further.

00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,758
Hello, my name is Jorge Gomez.

00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,884
I have been using Dropal for several years.

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
My account at Drupal.org is eight years old.

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
I agree with what Joaquin said.

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
It is not too easy to contribute to Drupal.

00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,760
Especially with core.

00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
I think it's now easier than before.

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Because the virtualization tools we have today,

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
GIT itself make it increasingly easier to have a development environment,

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
unified, identical to what the rock star core developers have.

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
It makes that contribution increasingly easier. 

00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,931
I think today is the best time to start contributing to core.

00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:50,106
Hi, I'm Alexandra Medina.

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,679
I don't Drupal, I don't know Drupal, but I am delighted with what you do.

00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,505
Convening so many people from so many places who are working on the same project,

00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,289
is really impressive.

00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:14,872
I hadn't had the opportunity to be at an event of this style.

00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:15,754
And I'll find a way to contribute to Drupal.

00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,344
I'm Alex Arriaga from Mexico.

00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,867
I have no time with Drupal.

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Less than a year.

00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,631
I started with version 7, which they recommended to in order to learn it.

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because it was the stable version at the time.

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
We are starting a company with Drupal.

00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I'm involved in a learning platform.

00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,521
Our first contribution was to be sponsors of Drupal.com, and I am very proud.

00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:57,977
I do not know how this process is, and I will be in the sprints.

00:30:57,977 --> 00:30:59,420
In order to learn the way to contribute.

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
My background is more in PHP, more in framework.

00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,075
A framework is similar to the core of Drupal.

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
I do not think it's so complex, not so simple either.

00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,655
I definitely liked this event.

00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:22,102
It is the first time I'm in a Drupal.com or Drupal camp.

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
I'm happy.

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
My name is Diego Gamboa.

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,830
I have been working with Drupal nearly two years.

00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:37,409
I have contributed more to the modules that I use.

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
The country modules.

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
In my opinion, it is a good idea to contribute to the core.

00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:52,417
Or at least I do not have it.

00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,060
 

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,080
I do not have the information or the line of work that you have with core.

00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,580
But doing so requires at least I have no information or line of work.

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,950
I can think there is something very valuable in my line of business.

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,450
I can think there is something very valuable in my line of business.

00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,784
But it may be something that does not represent the core much.

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Or that is not really required in the core as such.

00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:19,146
It would be very interesting, I have not looked but contributing to core sounds interesting.

00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,833
To contribute I have to know to what I am contributing.

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
What is the focus and analyze the work environment, 

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,220
and thus give my contribution.

00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
My name is Carlos Quintero.

00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,321
Just as with Alexandra, I do not develop in Drupal.

00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,991
Providing a different approach, I'm a commercial party.

00:32:56,704 --> 00:32:58,704
The company I work for does develop in Drupal.

00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:00,480
It has many customers in Latin America.

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,980
And in Africa.

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I see it is not just saying: I belong to a community, but making a contribution.

00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:13,146
And that contribution, as you well said, makes you a better developer.

00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
And it's like training to get better recognition.

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I see the company as: so interesting, that person makes contributions to Drupal, 

00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,300
a person who knows the subject is a good resource.

00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:35,932
As a company I can lean on such resources because I have some assurance that that person is a very good developer.

00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:41,194
I find it very interesting.

00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:46,082
Good afternoon, my name is Carolina Povera.

00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,080
I have known about Dropal for about 4 years.

00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
At this time, I am not developing, but I coordinate developers.

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
The message I bring is how do I coordinate the message of why we do not make a contribution to the core?

00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
And if they feel ownership and become a little more a part of Drupal.

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
I do not know if you have experienced this; getting Drupal developers is very complicated.

00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:21,217
It is very difficult.

00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,827
Many developers, whether PHP or another language feel a certain affection and belonging.

00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,303
Motivate them to contribute to this.

00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,022
I am interested in the subject of company. 

00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
It is very expensive to train people, pay them, etc.

00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,256
But if one promotes at the company this space in the community tspecifically focused on contributing to the core.

00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,994
We are already talking of code, testing, documentation, but we focus on the core.

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
If we focus on that, we are developing talent.

00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,225
We are making the talent of many people multiply.

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
I love teaching, sharing, etc.

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,844
I have nothing but too much space.

00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,794
If companies give more space because people are interested, 

00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,561
I am interested in teaching. We train new talent.

00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,192
And that talent will also train.

00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,438
This ecosystem will begin to rotate faster.

00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,561
It will generate more.

00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,945
Why do you have to involve a firm? 

00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:32,589
Because they have become interested inthe companies that have already been created at Drupal.

00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
They are known because Drupal is in the form they need.

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
The large, medium companies have also given that bit that they need so the business stops functioning.

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,619
With the vision they have.

00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,579
I have a vision in my market, etc.

00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,719
I will not say no, it will cost me because I need a developer who implements it.

00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:59,308
Why aren't we putting in the next version of Drupal.

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Let's put it there.

00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:09,976
When the community adopts it, it is important and powerful in free software.

00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
When Drupal 8 comes out, it will not be your company that has provided such an improvement that makes maintenance.

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
It will be the whole community.

00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:22,424
Because it will be part of the core.

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
When there is a contributed module or when there is a custom module, 

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,240
the custom module can be left there, can be adopted.

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
I've done 20 modules.

00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:36,606
I only have one that the community has adopted.

00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:41,371
It is a game of chance.

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Contributing to the core will cost more, but it will also give more advantages.

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
I'm going to take advantage of it, it will be maintained by the community.

00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:55,840
It becomes something that will unite us.

00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,981
There will also be competition.

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
But the market is too large.

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,460
Drupal is always expanding.

00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:06,576
There is no need to always worry about that.

00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:09,328
Drupal still is 2% of the Internet.

00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,220
It's not at 50 or 60%.

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
We have 98% to win.

00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,506
Before Drupal.com, I participated in the sprints.

00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:36,204
And, because of being a better programmer, I decided recently to take part in some of the modules.

00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Modules that had yet to be taken to Drupal 8.

00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:45,618
This time I'll do it for Drupal 8, for the core.

00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
I think it is worthwhile, and I look forward to it.

00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:58,015
Drupal core appears more important to me at this time than the modules.

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Hi, I'm Alberto Arancilla of Chile.

00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,147
I entered into Drupal in 2010.

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
The following year I began to see events in the contributed modules.

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,740
In 2012 I made an attempt to contribute to the Drupal core.

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,250
There was the core mentorship at that time.

00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:46,669
I was assigned some, and that was the conversion step to Synphony.

00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,096
I worked, and it was basically replacement work.

00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,344
I uploaded some patches, we made some corrections.

00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:02,269
I had good feedback and learned a lot. 

00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,132
Regarding how Drupal 8 was being restructured.

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,140
I uploaded the patch at a time in which I thought resolving the other had not been resolved.

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
My contribution was left there, finally I got an apprenticeship and was able to see many things.

00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:34,873
I could not specify a patch that was accepted for several reasons.

00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
The idea is to continue, return to get more involved.

00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:43,393
Be more aware of what is happening.

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Do something that makes a difference.

00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,290
And I'll be accepted.

00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,039
You say something important, as we were talking about that yesterday.

00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
On Monday, the first day of sprints, in the office we were like 20 people.

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
There were only three Latin Americans.

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
All the others were non-Latin Americas.

00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,060
It is a Latin American conference.

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
We will contribute, and there were a lot of shepherds and very few sheep.

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
It was a crazy

00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,637
But in the end I also tried to contribute and Katy was giving me instructions.

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
But I told her that I could not send a patch.

00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:42,422
And she told me you have done this and have documented.

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
You have to stop thinking that the patch was left there.

00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,573
At some point someone will take it.

00:40:57,313 --> 00:40:59,313
It's not that someone else will do it, and I will not do it.

00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,127
If each of us are advancing this.

00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:05,788
If at any time they suspend the issue, there is no problem.

00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:08,825
There are hundreds of others.

00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:16,231
What we can contribute, for example a review of issue to reach beta status.

00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
And this issue is important for beta release.

00:41:26,424 --> 00:41:28,424
There are many issues we have to review, we have to follow criteria, we have to document.

00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,971
Core maintainers, who will include these contributions have a basis of reasoning that we have helped them to have.

00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,147
They don't have to grab the issue and the raw problem.

00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:49,085
They already have the documented problem, have criteria to prioritize and we are helping them to that.

00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
It is a big step because we are helping to shape.

00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,940
What's next?

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,898
You don't have to install anything.

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Just open your browser, read the issue, follow the documentation that will occur during the sprint, and share criteria.

00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,572
It depends on us.

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Hello, my name is Alvaro Pozo.

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,669
I'm from Chile like Beto.

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
I started using Drupal in 2004. 

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,017
Drupal 4.

00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860
After about four years I began to coordinate developers.

00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:39,175
I stopped the development because I went to a company where the subject was not development.

00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,473
But the strategy and research to create a web application.

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
I come with doubt because for me to create software is like creating a movie.

00:42:59,669 --> 00:43:01,669
Or like directing an orchestra.

00:43:04,797 --> 00:43:06,797
No only developer, but graphic designer, artists, user researchers, digital strategies.

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,839
I come with the idea of ​​contributing to usability and improving the user experience.

00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,467
If there is a space.

00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:26,829
I've been a user for 11 years, but I have not contributed to Drupal core.

00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,666
I want to know if there is some room to work in testing, investigating users

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
and which interface really, since Drupal is the most powerful but has better competitors who surpass it in user experience.

00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:48,786
And I think that is the weak point of Drupal, being a Drupal fan of 11 years.

00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
We have reached the point that all issues need to go through an assessment of usability.

00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,213
There is a criterion of usability.

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
There it is fed, it matters if it reaches that level.

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,657
I'm no expert in usability. 

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
If we had those people like you who could help us fix those issues, 

00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:16,936
and I do not think this will change usability, I'll just put the button and this ends. 

00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:21,962
It's okay, all right.

00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,600
But if I talk to you, you tell me: no, wait.

00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:27,885
This really is very important for such and such a reason, and you know that matter.

00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,983
I love what you say, because we can talk about the strengths and weaknesses I have.

00:44:36,976 --> 00:44:38,976
You know usability.

00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,726
I know programming, I know debugging.

00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,381
What do we know?

00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:48,042
Each has a strong skill you would like to contribute.

00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:50,964
Everything has a place.

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,140
For multiple languages, translations, usability, testing.

00:44:58,186 --> 00:45:00,186
Performing analysis, doing issue, prioritizing.

00:45:00,186 --> 00:45:00,778
How to determine, this goes first and then that.

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
You have to organize things.

00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:12,397
There are a number of initiatives, configuration management.

00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:18,307
The day of sprints, on Thursday, we will have several tables.

00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,684
And every table has different themes in which one can contribute.

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,140
You will be someone who can guide us with that.

00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
The idea is that the issues that we are working on reach a state called RTBC. Review and test by community.

00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,256
If we get an issue is in this state, happy.

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
It is ready for the core maintainer to come and put it in the core.

00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,699
And I leave you with this idea.

00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,493
I have a friend who lives in Guadalajara and she works for a company.

00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
It is called Universal.

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
It designs tires, auto parts, etc.

00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,260
One day she says to me: you see that car that is going around.

00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
The carriage board, I designed it myself.
