	00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,104
-

00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:08,104
 

00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:10,104
The idea for today is to go over a little about what the six years in Buenos Aires were.

00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,811
At theme level, the idea is to see how we built a service platform,

00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,582
how we created a migration of content that was basically to look for an organization of 100,000 employees.

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
To write the Internet.

00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,911
and the idea is to review the product.

00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:32,745
The portal for tourism, for employment, a citizen's digital ID, 

00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:34,470
and in the end it is something we are also working at,

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,970
it's a Distro of government for governments.

00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:45,298
Item 7 is that we find there are many or several government Distros 

00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:45,799
It is very focused on what the federal part is,

00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:48,608
that does not apply to cities,

00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:49,940
does not apply to provinces.

00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
The content types in Drupal, the work of redoing the sites is more costly.

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
To give them context and I go very slowly in this part.

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,843
Our experience is 80 million visits.

00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,569
During 2014, we had 30 million single visits and we've already passed the million 600 thousand mobile applications.

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
This is what we call digital audience in the city.

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,730
which are basically citizens interacting in information and services.

00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,875
95% of these people run on our Drupal sites.

00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,026
The city of Buenos Aires has its own data center.

00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,332
We finance our stuff, we're not in the cloud due to the legal issue.

00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:35,160
We have our own data center.

00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:37,342
But not every thing was as pretty.

00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:39,163
This was the first government web.

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,710
And I swear we'll reach a point, as you know the sites in 97 were these.

00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,365
everyone watching football and tango, and the ballet was what mattered in the city. 

00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,768
Afterwards, the site was modernized, a change took place.

00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,699
and this was more or less our site from 2004 to 2012.

00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,793
The chart changing a little, but in the back, it was the same.

00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,288
We really had no content manager.

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
All that was used was a web lab where html was uploaded and codes were reused.

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It was copied, documented and written.

00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,559
And so we found that in 2008 we had this situation.

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
28 call centers, 400 sites, 1000 Legacy applications.

00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:30,803
80% of the things we did were outsourced and 20% was done inhouse.

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There was 0 internal government culture,

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
and 0 equipment integration.

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,180
It's the big problem that public administration has, that they work as silos. 

00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,951
They are all isolated. Each creates the strategy and the technology they want. 

00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:47,754
Much about reinventing the wheel.

00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,313
Which brings us to a problem of trying to understand how first to simplify a call center.

00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:54,959
That's another story.

00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,307
But mostly the problem we had was the dispersion of what the websites were.

00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,508
400 sites in which most likely, if you were looking for the same information,

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,140
400 times it was not written the same way.

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
which generated a user website problem.

00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:11,383
Basically our user experience sucked.

00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,158
And it was unmanageable.

00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,030
And everything depended on one programmer.

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,060
If you had to change a text, you needed a programmer.

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
It was the underemployment of the programmer.

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Because you are changing the code by hand.

00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,628
Which brings us to 2012, 2010 to 2012.

00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,128
 

00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,628
 

00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:30,242
This was the last screenshot of the old site.

00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,606
So we had the idea of ​​switching to something.

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Which at the time we did not know if it was Drupal, Shumbla, Worprener, or we had to build our own framework.

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,209
We started investigating in 2010, 2011 we were in what was Drupal.com Chicago.

00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,768
Trying to find our backroom, who kept it, why take a framework,

00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,915
we ended up adopting Drupal because we realized there was a community backing it up.

00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,237
which could keep all the core, and they ensured us that there were going to be new versions coming.

00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,417
And security patches and lots of other things that were planned.

00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,280
Sites. 

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
When you choose a framework, or choose a CVS you have to know that there is a community backing it up.

00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,987
Also the technological decision was to go to Drupal php at the time.

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
We had php scheduled and it was ready.

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,660
And it could go out.

00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,806
Quickly, what we created.

00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,598
Basically we started creating internal policies.

00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,493
We created a dataset policy that had all the open government.

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,630
We created technology standards, today when we are using free software,

00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,974
Today we created 80% of internal software and 20% outsourced.

00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,775
When we outsourced it with our standard, it was usually free software.

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Almost all Drupal and opensource technologies.

00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,352
And in turn, we generated internal procedures, standards within public administration to

00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,691
make default.

00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,520
that any process or procedure is digital.

00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,263
Thought of first for digital.

00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,533
You can stop me any time to ask questions.

00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,846
Our basic infrastructure is not crazy.

00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,320
We did not do anything unusual.

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
We put a varnish ahead of a Drupal 7.

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
That in the same instance Drupal co-exists with the Buenos Aires site and the tourism site.

00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,122
That in the same instance Drupal co-exists with the Buenos Aires site and the tourism site.

00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,490
 

00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,257
And Solr.

00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:48,757
We have Solr, Mysql, Internal today, public in the future.

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,010
Our GIS environment, the graphics, that we have our own engine and map.

00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,591
A OpenX to make banners.

00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,087
and Sarbars that is something you have to learn to manage.

00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,562
And we build together with OpenID or OpenID connect now all the part about national identity.

00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,176
This structure allows us to manage between 70 and 60 million visits per year.

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
In a quite scalable manner.

00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:26,691
Today, we have an average daily or almost simultaneous amount of users from 3.700 to 1.900 users per second.

00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,281
These are things that we have done.

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,620
This is a traffic outlook of our Varnish and our Drupal.

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
What you see on the right are visitors.

00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:50,331
The left side are the parts that we serve.

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,290
And the balls or explosions are the number of hits they are taking.

00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,854
We take our Varnish and Drupal logs and look at them.

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
We do an opensource outlook that allows us to see the infrastructure to begin to see the amount of traffic.

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
That each of the parts of the site is receiving.

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
You see, what gets the most hits are the images, there are things that are already in the cache and do not pass.

00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
This also helps us a lot with QA.

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
And yes, the big change we made in management was to incorporate GIT.

00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,958
We opted for Git, which we didn't use before.

00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,359
 I don't know if you know, when you are a state supplier,

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
the state needs to have the source code.

00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,182
Suppliers must provide the source code on a CD or DVD.

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,580
Which becomes useless for management because it has a pile of things that is abandonware.

00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,543
We incorporate the model that suppliers deliver the source code via git.

00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,477
Gitlab is used internally for more than 1,000 users and more than 200 projects.

00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Suppliers deliver us the code and do a push, and we take a pull,

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,180
and that goes to the entire infrastructure.

00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:04,194
And our internal products do push and pull and they leave.

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
This allows us to do things like this.

00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,511
This is the log of our git, basically.

00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,993
What you see are branches, projects, each explosion is when someone uploads something to the repo.

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
If you look on the screen, we see the types of languages.

00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,476
And the user types is the type of project you are entering.

00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,873
This is what you envision and what you see is interaction of the different areas of government.

00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:32,972
As they are pushing towards the git code.

00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:40,191
This is what we seek in government, interaction, integration, and what will be taken away.

00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,638
Another thing we did was to standardize.

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
We created an IOX guide and a viewing guide readapting what is Bustrap.

00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,827
BAstrap is a framework created by people on twitter that basically standardizes the front somehow.

00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,453
What we did was to create a brand and a manual, if you enter the city git you can see, it is a living document.

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
What we did was that whenever one of our people or a supplier,

00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,514
internally wanted to develop something, they came to our development staff where we asked them to use Drupal 

00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,952
and all the libraries and they were given our link to our bustrap or bastrap.

00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,329
For us it is all documentation and all styles and other things we use in the front of the city.

00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,998
What we achieve is to escalate and manage a lot of simultaneous projects

00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,115
that must have the same aesthetics. 

00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,453
What we want is to have navigation coherence between our users.

00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,220
And this is the easiest so far.

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Our main problem was the integration and migration of content.

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,630
It is a Legacy place, almost a million html containing the last 10 years of the city.

00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,758
Where we tried to migrate first, and it was all wrong.

00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,938
The first year we adopted a forced migration of a million pages and content and we lost it.

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,290
It was not successful.

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
And we decided to start from scratch, building a Drupal intended for government and by government.

00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,621
And again with the opportunity to rewrite the content aimed at the end users and not for the stupid ego of managment.

00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,521
The government always writes in a hard way things that citizens are not interested in.

00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,113
We decided to train the entire administration.

00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,584
Today we have as editors 1000 writers who create content inside the administration.

00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,066
A part of my team does the follow-up and educates them to write for Internet,

00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,463
and does follow up on content.

00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,766
We create different types of content.

00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,244
News, areas, pages, book, procedure pages, landings and applications.

00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,414
Those are the types of content we currently use in Drupal.

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
If you think of a city, you don't need anything else.

00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:15,147
News to communicate, description, pages, book pages and create certain things,

00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,082
such as the content of procedures thinking of paperwork or a procedure for public administration.

00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,675
What we write is like a step-by-step guide.

00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,122
of how a citizen can perform a procedure.

00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:31,348
There was a lot of training with the areas.

00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,633
They were forced to rewrite their processes in 4 or 5 steps.

00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,186
If they can not apply it in 4 steps, it does not enter the web site.

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
We worked hard on building a Drupal community .

00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,963
From 2012 till today, we did three gobcamps.

00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:57,309
It strikes me that I have not heard of this.

00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,783
It's always done within government.

00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:00,780
It is 100% government.

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,340
It is 100% domestic.

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
The idea is that this year we want to open up but it depends on the amount of places we get.

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,430
The idea of ​​this is like a Drupal.com,

00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,832
it's like a barcamp.

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Before government people were asked.

00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,483
The idea was to have more than 500 employees of government where projects were explained.

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,930
One was basically Drupal, web and mobile applications.

00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,843
and anything could happen from a minister talking, a sub-secretary, anyone.

00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:42,343
No matter the range.

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,009
It was to generate a conference for technology transfer within the government.

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
We do a lot of these things to create community.

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
It is also participating with other programmers who have other areas of government and transform them

00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,900
or angel-ize them.

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Within what is Drupal.

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
We used their driving force for that.

00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,453
Regarding migration, if I go too fast please tell me.

00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,855
And that led us to what is now the Buenos Aires portal.

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
This is the home of today in the morning.

00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,225
We then give you two pages.

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,070
Home where those who visit us are placed in front of the citizen.

00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:35,304
Then there is the procedures model, which takes you to the procedure with Solar that helps you to quickly identify the procedures and services.

00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,423
A catalog of applications within the same Drupal view.

00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,165
The types of applications are then displayed in a store.

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
If you visit you will find that there are official city applications.

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
blended with applications that have come out of our open government application contests.

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
And they are published there.

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Areas such as in this case sub.

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
We sat down with each area or each business unit or every area of ​​government,

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,913
and redesigned its digital communication.

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
Must be improved.

00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,859
One question. 

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Within this process of dictating policy, what is the relationship between the city government and the government of the country.

00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,689
or the federal government.

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
What orders are there, and what autonomy does the city have opposite to the central government.

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
The city of Buenos Aires is autonomous.

00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,642
It has complete autonomy over national government and makes its own policies.

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
By having a legislature and senate it has its own rules, has its own accessibility law,

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,843
has its own law on access to information.

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,460
So our sites pass the compliments.

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
We have an application that generates a solution for people with disabilities.

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Auditory or visual or motor and can navigate the site,

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,000
they can navigate by blowing, or by typing.

00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:29,422
There are different solutions with different organizations.

00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,151
The opportunity we saw to build a new site was also relaunching the government application.

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
 Which then led us to create a version of Drupal integrated with our main site, but for tourism.

00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,599
This is the cover of tourism,

00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,160
which today already exists in three languages.

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,932
It is in English, Portuguese and Spanish.

00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,166
Here we have it in Spanish.

00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:01,666
In Spanish and English they have a different publisher.

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
What is in Spanish on the right is different from the content in English.

00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,879
There is an area of ​​government that manages all content in English on tourism and one in Spanish.

00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,261
They are generating different kinds of communication.

00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,631
This all allows us to do Drupal from the multilingual side.

00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,656
All within the same Drupal, and have different domains

00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,281
or they are two different Drupals that have different content.

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Tourism and buenosaires.ar are within the same Drupal.

00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,739
They reuse the core modules and business modules we have.

00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:48,703
They are in different domains.

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Different databases, but the installation is the same as Drupal.

00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
This allows us to use whatever we develop for buenosaires.ar

00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,998
To reuse it in tourism.

00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
In turn, last year we decided to remake our search portal.

00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,340
The city has an area of ​​employment that allows private companies to upload their job searches

00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,841
on their Portal.

00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,289
It was a framework that we did not control, that they had bought from a supplier.

00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
We redid Drupal and integrated it with our city, we'll see later.

00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,672
If one enters our job portal

00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:35,548
what you find is the citizen's profile,

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
This profile is related to the same user account there is inside buenosaires.ar

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
That is the main portal.

00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,078
And what they get is job offers according to the work profile they uploaded.

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
This for example is my profile and it depends on what I uploaded.

00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,145
I begin to receive offers that interest me.

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,059
From my applications, there are my CV, my experience, all my data.

00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,556
And I can apply to get them.

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
This allows us to create a customized experience for users.

00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:14,971
Give them a segmented service and they find just what they are interested in 

00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,617
and not bombard them with information.

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Last year advanced to have a citizen Dashboard.

00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,206
For the ID we used openid connect, which is the same standard as Estonia and the UK.

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
In Drupal 7 version, openid is part of the modules.

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,603
In 8 it was removed.

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
It was an extremely simple integration, we arrived at a concept where one logs into

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,191
your email or your Facebook account.

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
That will create a user account for you that allows you to access different things.

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
We created a dashboard within the Drupal Distro,

00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,684
We did the front in an angle.

00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,859
What we do is bring many services.

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
E.g., You are going to find that this is my dashboard and I can access school registration,

00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,983
because all parents can enroll their children in schools once a year,

00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,219
and is centralized.

00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,840
Social rent.

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
It is a program of the city where they help you get a credit

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,749
or guarantee to rent an apartment in the city.

00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:23,663
That's another site built in Drupal.

00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,634
It is integrated with our ID.

00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,843
The job portal and competitions platform,

00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,180
that is not Drupal but Opensource.

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
What we want is to always generate the same id for the user.

00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,109
This automatically brings our system of public attention.

00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,918
My complaints.

00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:45,185
I have a claim for broken pipes or sidewalk.

00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,444
It tells me the state where it is and what state it is.

00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,262
It is denied because I said it was a test.

00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,114
It also allows us to take general turns for marriage.

00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:01,151
All turns in the health area.

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
Our health system has turns and turns are via the web.

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
They are digital, through the user.

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
That is what allows us to measure user preferences tomorrow and use our process.

00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,776
If you always ask for a turn on a Thursday, and I always give you an option on a Monday,

00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:25,653
it is likely that you will reject it, or possibly you will accept it and not show up.

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,780
The no-show.

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
If we can not find a way to improve your user experience

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,740
which for us is streamlining the processes and providing better service.

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,070
The idea of ​​creating an id is that.

00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,599
It is intended for citizens and tourists in the city.

00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,798
Many people access services needed by citizens,

00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:46,714
and others do not.

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
The goal is 120,000 users to reach two million users by the end of this year.

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,140
Integrating it with other services.

00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,704
I'm going too fast.

00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,644
We are working on a project with NYU.

00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:05,254
It is the University of New York.

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
It's called ExpertNet.

00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:15,084
ExpertNet seeks to solve the main problem that public administration has.

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
That is who knows more about anything.

00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:21,248
Finding the person who knows most about floods in the city.

00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,160
Usually it is not the CEO.

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,620
It is the person who knows how the storm sewers are.

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
who are needed at the time of internal work.

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,198
This is the experience we are taking for an intranet.

00:21:34,198 --> 00:21:36,198
 

00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:41,193
That we may upload users within city employees.

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
With their profiles and skills.

00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:49,418
 and generate a seeker of people within an administration.

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,420
to find them faster.

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I just had a concern about the way to link the development activities of all these functionalities

00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:07,545
of the project to encourage visits and content consumption

00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,160
and the information generated on the user platform

00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,144
given they have these goals, they may be quite aggressive in certain cases,

00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,406
and you just have to see how to encourage the user to start using this as a service.

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
What we do is transparent to the user.

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
What we want to create is an umbrella on the number of single users

00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,288
that the administration is creating.

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
The state loves to use the word single for whatever system.

00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:45,343
What we did was to force all our business applications,

00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:45,843
to put it one way,

00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,821
We are not forcing the user, 

00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:52,361
to adopt a single id to generate that user transversality.

00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
The user does not have to look for work, take a turn and ask for a birth certificate.

00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,724
In turn, if you need, and you have to create three different accounts,

00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,484
It's ridiculous.

00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,525
We are not forcing the user, we are forcing us internally,

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
to integrate systems.

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
That is what trangevirilidad allows us.

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
It gives us the opportunity to force different areas to rethink the systems and generate such integration.

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
ExpertNet itself is looking to generate a Drupal Distro to install internally.

00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:39,661
in governments and build a kind of searcheable, seekable intranet.

00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,626
that allows us to get to know the people.

00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:45,516
Like any large administration is very difficult to know the people.

00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:47,500
It is very difficult to know which projects work.

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,919
That saves a lot of time.

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
And prevents the whole concept of reinventing the wheel.

00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,551
Which is very common.

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Which brings us to a Drupal Distro.

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,890
Always the question is what is a distro.

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Because we want to build a community of Drupal users,

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,657
we want to have codes reused.

00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,920
Cities have the same problem.

00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,623
The scales changes, the budget changes.

00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,801
But cities all have the same problems.

00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:29,483
And the same needs.

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,690
We advance a lot by learning a lot from other cities.

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
About our sites.

00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,845
And we believe we can think of a version of Drupal with which you can take the community,

00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:42,740
and work on that.

00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,326
Our idea is to focus on what cities need to provide services to citizens.

00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:51,174
Not focused on selling areas of government.

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Nobody visits a government site for the heck of it.

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Our distro deals with the basics, roles and permissions,

00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:07,263
use organic groups for the entire decentralization.

00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,060
SolR for creation of areas and their content.

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,180
Content, procedures, applications and news and our bootstrap.

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
No need to be productive, if not you go to the new version. 

00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,363
That has allowed us to move.

00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,620
We're at that stage now.

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Graphic and functional.

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,060
We are building an alpha, it will be ready by March.

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
We will have an internal release in June.

00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:41,569
And in August.

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,210
If these internal releases pass our QA, security and everything we understand,

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
is the need for a web of government for the pubic, we will have it in October.

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Our idea is to use git for a git profile for the city and have a profile on Drupal.org to upload the distro.

00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:15,846
The idea of ​​this distro is that it will be aligned with the new government site.

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
You will have maintenance and evolution, things developed by the city will also be deployed.

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
The distro will be public.

00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:28,141
It will look more or less like this.

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
This is the chart of the new city site.

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
There are thousands of things, like a river.

00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,449
The whole experience of government. 

00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,989
We've removed the slider. Finally, the one for 2012 is going to stay.

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Until 2016.

00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,259
Much more graphic, the whole issue of paperwork, all rethought.

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
The ideal would be for the screen to shrink.

00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,503
Home becomes an application.

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
It becomes responsive directly.

00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,296
The areas start to be more graphic, more usual.

00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,056
This allows us to advance further.

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I think that from 2012 it was 3%, from 2013 it was 7, last year it was 8, and so it will continue to grow.

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
It is inevitable that we will go mobile, that we bring our paperwork to mobile.

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
The site itself will be transformed into a great app, when taken from a phone.

00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,683
Thanks and questions.

00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:48,185
Will they be transformed or are you going to continue with Drupal and via web?

00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:50,126
It is not going to be converted into a app.

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
No, the idea is as follows:

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
This is the site, and it looks like an app.

00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
But if I enlarge this, it puts the site in a mobile model so more people can visit it at that time.

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,830
And we try for the phone to have what can be found quickly.

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,347
Are you interested in not having the site below?

00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,835
Go with that to home to procedures, services,

00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:56,674
the ID, all done quickly with one click.

00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:00,641
You go, you get the service you use, that is what we mean.

00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,455
Drupal itself, has not advanced.

00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:10,452
There are many people working to protect user experience.

00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,533
What percentage do you have?

00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,040
You're talking a lot about the user.

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Is there great percentage of people working at that?

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,882
Yes.

00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
We have a great mix of developers focused on user experience.

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
We spent six years building a senior team.

00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:38,321
We do not seek a great volume of people, but talented, centered.

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Everything is good in front, everything is good in back, and in IOX we have three leaders.

00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:46,963
Two for design, testing all day, all day measuring.

00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:49,503
So my team is built.

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
I have two questions.

00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
One regarding the bastrap, how is it distributed?.

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
If each organization has its local copy or has it centralized in a CDN or something like that.

00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:12,585
And the infrastructure and support for the users are logged in with Drupal.

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
If we have an internal CDN?

00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,083
How do we support network users? 

00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,061
It is a great challenge.

00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,125
As such, we are now using angle when the front is raised.

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,850
Everything is for the user experience.

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
We use quotation marks, similar to what Facebook does, it pushes you

00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
a giant coer.

00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:51,728
That was the only way we found it would not die,

00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
because if it is Varnish, which is anonymous.

00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,829
as much as I would like these things, everything is being used in angle.

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
These are services that come, many things we do far back.

00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
Internal Services are crons and the rest of the front itself is angular.

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,496
And it is working quite well now.

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
This is not a technical question.

00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:28,482
I'm impressed because the word may hurt a little, but,

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
For something like what you did there to work in this country, 

00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:37,575
you would need in a certain way almost a dictatorial behavior.

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
to be able to unify all that work across government.

00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,076
I do not understand how you did it, congratulations, it is a wonder.

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
I do not understand how you managed to get everyone together to work with everyone.

00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,455
I wonder what you did.

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Unfortunately it's a bit dictatorial.

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
If you see the example, its not only us.

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
It's what gov.uk in the UK did.

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
To become the most hated person in the government, but it was for their sake.

00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,384
The idea is that everything is demonstrated in our work,

00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:16,983
and we went through a large process to explain.

00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:21,268
Why is the way shown, what was metrics, analytics, navigation.

00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,478
Beyond being a whim, it had to be understood that there was a larger click rate,

00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,513
demonstrating what the user wanted,

00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:31,923
to put in content that was no good.

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I would be suicidal if I was going to read the missions and functions of ​​government area.

00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,720
Nobody does.

00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:42,937
It is the institutional area and everything is fine, but people have other interests.

00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,778
There is a need for it and you have five seconds to give it the best user experience.

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Or if you do your job wrong, you can ruin his day.

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,660
Five seconds of your day.

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,209
It's a lot of power.

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Ruining five seconds of the life of a person.

00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
The user is frustrated with some portals.

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
To that end, there comes a time when you have to be very firm in administration.

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,260
We luckily had much support from the secretary general.

00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
and the head of government to do this, and the path of internet, 

00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
 

00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,106
which gave us a lot of freedom to build this site.

00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,375
