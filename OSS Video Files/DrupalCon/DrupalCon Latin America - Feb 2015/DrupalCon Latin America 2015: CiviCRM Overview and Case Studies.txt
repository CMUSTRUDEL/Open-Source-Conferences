00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,850
interested in having somebody present on

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,360

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,870
a very popular project and it works very

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,969
well with drupal so they wanted to be

company that deals with city crm is

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,780
called square it's pronounced square

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,210
even though it's about a little bit

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,270
differently square is in the rectangle

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,880

want wherever you might be so we talked

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,259
a little bit just before we started

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,520
about who's in the audience but just by

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,979
the show of hands how many of you have

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,710
implemented some kind of a CRM system

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,320
before I just Drupal but any kind of

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,729
Sarah and Salesforce sugar or any kind

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
of serum how many of you have worked

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,930
with nonprofits or educational

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,030
institutions or professional

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,610
associations okay so we've got a very

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,340
good cross-section here all right so

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,619
what's on the menu here today well we're

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,030
going to talk about the city CRM and we

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,990
are going to talk about why you might

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,409
want or need City crm what are some of

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,899
the key features of the system what are

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,299
the different components it's it's very

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,000
modularized so what are the different

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,829
components of it and look at some use

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,170
cases when you might want to use it how

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,270
you might want to use it who's using it

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,709
okay and I'm certainly open to any

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,840
questions if you have or if you

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,830
something pops up you can we can make

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
this a little bit more

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,800
active I'll be sure to repeat the

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,570
questions so that they're recorded into

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,430
the audio into the stream that's going

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,680
to be posted on the internet later so

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:33,650
when you think of a CRM what do you

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:37,800
think the C stands for customer contact

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,840
client Oh correct I'm customer

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,980
constituent if you're in a non-profit

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,130
market they might they might not

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,540
necessarily refer to them as customer or

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,880
client but they might refer to him as a

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,400
constituent and you're all right at the

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,490
end of the day it's basically a contact

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,610
record from which a lot of of the

00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:00,330
activities and everything else revolves

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:03,540
so historically when you look and Reese

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,920
really touched on this today from a

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,390
little bit different perspective in his

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,750
keynote but when you look at it

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,240
historically any organization be it for

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,030
profit nonprofit even individual

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,459
organization you basically have your

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,220
website your you're the epicenter of it

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,459
right and everybody else kind of comes

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,260
to you or if you want to look at it from

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,330
the content perspective you are the

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,850
ultimate authority and everybody comes

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,300
to you and pulls in the day that pulls

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,739
in the content right so this is how most

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,440
organizations most companies most

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,230
nonprofits have operated until very

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,150
recently and what started to happen if

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,510
you really look at the marketplace is

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,330
now your website or your your engagement

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,790
platform whatever that may be becomes

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,959
really one of the many things out there

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,400
and the communication starts happening

00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,420
all in different directions and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,519
sometimes completely bypasses you being

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,890
in the center yet still it's very

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,780
relevant in the in the cloud of

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,780
conversation that's taking place it

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,549
might be a very relevant topic to you to

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,620
your organization to your nonprofit to

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,049
your mission but it might actually be

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,030
happening kind of on the side where it's

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,600
actually not touching your website but

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,180
it's very relevant to it makes sense all

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,250
right so what's the general solution

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,750
what has been the general solution well

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,210
you've got your website in them

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,490
alright and then somebody says hey yeah

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,920
we need to plug in some context and

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,670
we've kind of outgrown our spreadsheet

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,170
with 150 people in there so let's set up

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,210
Salesforce they have a solution for

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,980
nonprofits right they kind of rebranded

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,240
their product and they put if you want

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,160
to keep track of context put them in

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,600
Salesforce okay that sounds good that

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,150
somebody says well we really need kind

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,250
of a community engagement and we'd

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,720
really like to set up some forums in

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,010
some groups all right so somebody goes

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,860
out there and sits up google groups

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,180
still okay and somebody says well I

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,340
don't like the interface or something

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,290
let's we've got this yahoo group already

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,419
here for this subgroup over here and

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,400
then somebody says well we need to send

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,410
out everybody email so let it set up a

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,169
you know either constant contact or

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,810
aweber or MailChimp or somebody else out

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,000
there and then you start organizing an

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,610
event so you go and put out an evite

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,980
right and then you want people either to

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,690
donate to you or you want them to pay

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,010
for an event or some kind of a service

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,160
so then you set up a paypal and

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:33,510
authorize.net account what are you guys

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,770
thinking when you see this too many

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:41,940
things to handle big ecosystem to

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,979
support and interface with right my

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,900
question really to the top of the

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,810
organization and the technology people

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,430
in the room is where does your data live

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,720
where is your customer constituent

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,729
client data when you have all these or

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,350
parts of these systems interacting

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,590
because how many of you have more than

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,510
three email addresses right all of us

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,820
almost all of us have three email

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,460
addresses right and is your email

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,140
address always the same on some website

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,680
that where you're registered and in

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,120
paypal and on evite and you know maybe

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,020
what's in sales stores are in some kind

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,520
of a CRM system no right so even when

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,960
people say well that's okay that we have

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
multiple system we can always kind of

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,950
tie it back together right but whether

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,660
you're living in an english-speaking

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,630
country where there is plenty of John

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,190
Smith's or you're living in Latin

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,360
America or some country where there is

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,340
plenty of Juan Carlos's right and then

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,260
you say well we can okay we can't quite

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,810
do you duplicate and reconcile our data

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,639
between different systems based on the

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,960
names so let's use email addresses but

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,790
you can't really do that because as we

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,650
just found out everybody's got three

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,199
four five ten different email addresses

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,150
all right so what's the solution here

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,900
now that's why we're here in the session

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,300
solution is really about City CRM and

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,760
because that one system can encompass

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,240
all of those different functionalities

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,060
and as I like to put it cv crm you can

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,669
download it separately from cbc RMG org

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,139
and it's really more than a module most

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,210
people tend to think of drupal and

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,970
modularity of it and they think i'll

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,940
count just download it and it'll be out

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,680
in a bolide like a module and you do but

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,630
at the same time it's it's really more

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,600
than a module it's it's a compilation of

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,120
modules it's a whole ecosystem and it's

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,229
actually I would like to say it's more

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,880
than a modular and less than a

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,010
distribution right have you worked with

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,570
Drupal distributions before okay so it's

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,840
kind of more than a module less than a

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,760
distribution but really it's a platform

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,770
the good news is Drupal is coming on

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,750
what 14 years right that's just

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,620
celebrated City CRM has been around

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,900
since 2004 as well so it's 11 years that

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,039
it's been around it's another open

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,630
source project and it does work with

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,070
Drupal and other content management

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,800
systems it does work with joomla and

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,210
wordpress if you're inclined to do it

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,500
but you wouldn't be at drupalcon if you

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,740
were doing a lot of that kind of work

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,750
right but it does work so it's it's a

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,849
content management platform almost

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,200
independent and I'll qualify the almost

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,240
a little bit later on when we talk about

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,389
some of the customizations and how it

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,160
interacts the good news is several

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,770
several years back there was a decision

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,690
made by CB CRM team that said you know

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,760
what will leave all the content and all

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,919
the gooey old affront an interface to

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,330
the content management system and we'll

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,669
focus on developing the core

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,260
functionality on the backend and i will

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,959
tell you I've been in technology for

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,659
quite some time CB crm is probably one

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,180
of the most normalized databases that

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,620
i've seen out there once you start

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,510
understanding how the database and how

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,520
the data flows and everything else it is

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,400
extremely normalized and it's very well

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,060
designed so it came from the nonprofit

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,600
background

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,190
and as I said it's open source so you

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,490
can download it you can modify it and

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,590
hopefully you contribute back relevant

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,100
to this group it's internationalized

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,480
right so now what do I mean by

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,010
internationalized because i'm not

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,339
talking about specifically just

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,810
multilingual the way addresses are

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,990
displayed the way currencies are

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,330
displayed the way dates and times so it

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,810
adapts to the to the geographic or the

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,420
cultural context in which it operates

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,310
okay and there is quite a few spanish

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,680
and portuguese implementations of this

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,330
out there and there is i don't have the

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,200
latest count of the translations out

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,740
there but there's quite a few

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,040
translations of cv crm available for use

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,810
and for download so the localization of

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,310
addresses dates currency and everything

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,040
is out there of course it's web-based

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,890
which is great because if you've dealt

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,460
with nonprofit organizations or you know

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,290
NGOs etc you know a lot of them have you

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,660
know a little filemaker pro or an Access

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,580
database and they're just ever so happy

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,130
to be using that because that's what

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,540
they've been using for the last 10 years

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,040
until that computer crashes or until

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,480
that person is sick and they don't know

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
the password of how to get in there and

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,230
then suddenly they realize well wait a

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,220
minute this is probably not a very

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:17,880
scalable system to use ok so it's

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:22,080
web-based and last but not least on its

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,540
integrated and when I say integrated it

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,560
means it's integrated with the drupal

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,790
CMS ok what that really means in the

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,580
real real world is on the user interface

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,740
when they log into the website they may

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,060
not know whether they're actually or

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,450
when they're going to register for an

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,740
event or when they're donating the end

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,480
user doesn't need to say well I'm

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,860
logging in here i'm logging in here or

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,690
something like that it's all integrated

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,910
together and you can we'll go through

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,360
some kind of real work real world

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,430
scenarios here that will show you and

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,370
tell you how you can actually combine

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,900
the data from the city crm side of

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,390
things and database and how you can

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,420
react to it on the on the content side

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,440
and do a lot of fun stuff so in real

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,600
world

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,910
tional associations right if you're an

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,740
engineer if you're a you know a builder

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,250
if you're whatever professional

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,630
association a lot of activists use this

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,570
number of schools and educational

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,310
institutions and we've actually seen

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,380
this and we use this ourselves at square

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,500
there is a number of businesses that

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,690
tend to use this system ok now the

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,280
language in in the system when you open

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,430
up by default is going to be targeted

00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,770
towards the nonprofit's but it can

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,300
actually see V serum has the capability

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,980
of going in there regardless of what

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,290
language you use and do word

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,820
substitutions so if you don't like the

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,530
word contribution and you want to call

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,200
it payment you can go in there and put

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,580
in your your text strings and say I want

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,900
to replace every where it says

00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,190
contribution I want to replace it with

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,480
payment done that's been that was

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,720
implemented probably within the last

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,670
couple years 18 months or so so and it's

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,010
very useful because even at the you know

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,600
the difference with open sores and I had

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,720
a big conversation over dinner last

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,520
night with somebody who's fairly new to

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,900
the open source community but has a lot

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,330
of software background and I said you

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,680
know the difference is when you're

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,890
buying somebody or when somebody else is

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,360
selling you a prepackaged custom

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,220
software that's developed and its

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,840
proprietary they come in in the

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,750
basically say hey look what I have buy

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,970
this right versus with open sores as you

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,030
all know is when we go out there and we

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,260
offer client solutions is basically it

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,570
can do a lot of different things but

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,030
what do you really need again that's a

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,400
very different way of approaching it so

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,410
when we walk into a non-profit we're not

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,050
necessarily trying to revamp their

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,780
processes and say you have to match this

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,330
we're more likely to ask well how do you

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,790
work today does it work for you and if

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,710
it does okay then let's keep using it

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,720
and match up the system and the workflow

00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,400
to that or if you've been doing it that

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,600
way for the last 20 years because that's

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,970
just the way you've been doing it since

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,710
faxes we're coming in then let's take a

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,020
look and see where we can rearrange some

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,520
things but it's more of a consultative

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,580
back and forth approach rather than

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,800
saying hey here's what I got use it okay

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,500
so a lot of times we'll walk into the

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,120
real world here and even a non-profit

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,920
might say well we don't really refer to

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,880
them as donors or we don't really refer

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,160
to these things as

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,640
tributions we want to label it something

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,840
else the system supports I all right so

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,750
somebody you might have heard of before

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,870
Amnesty International who uses cv crm

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,190
right they they use that as a matter of

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,460
fact how many of you are drupal

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,080
association members all right get part

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,030
of the group when you went in and signed

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,830
up for drupal association membership you

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:50,040
were actually interacting with cv crm on

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:53,900
the back end okay so drupal association

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,130
uses cv crm amnesty international

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,410
conservation fund so these are some

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,200
really big well-known names that you

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,860
would probably know about you probably

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,690
heard of the Linux Foundation right and

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,400
again some of their web front-ends might

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,320
be in Drupal or may not be but on the

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,290
back end for the CRM functionality

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,510
that's what they do integrate another

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,390
one that do you know if TechSoup here in

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,910
Latin America I strongly recommend you

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,100
look it up I know they have a large

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,590
footprint in multiple different

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,750
countries this is a website where this

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,820
is an organization nonprofit where you

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,610
go in and as a non-profit you can join

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,400
them and then as a non-profit you are

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:40,110
eligible for deeply deeply discounted

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:42,960
software subscriptions etc so if your

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,140
nonprofit or your client uses microsoft

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,780
office last thing last time I checked it

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,120
was like five dollars a subscription

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,040
okay if they're using gotomeeting

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,620
instead of fifty dollars a month it's

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,820
something like fifty dollars a year so

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,840
if your nonprofit if your organization

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,580
wants to do webcasts or go to meetings

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,380
seminars or something like that this is

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,850
an excellent place to go in and again on

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,660
the back end they use cv crm alright

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,300
something a little bit smaller that

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,850
we've done that's local to texas is

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,560
there is a mountain biking association

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,140
in houston and they came to us and they

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,030
said you know we've got this kind of

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,940
concoction of different you know PHP

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,160
bulletin board and HTML website in this

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,650
database on the backend that just sits

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,089
on somebody's computer and we've got

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,920
hundreds of different members that we'd

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,120
like to really engage and give them a

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,010
better interface etc so not only we

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,290
built of a nice drupal front end web

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,240
site but on the back end they can

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,580
actually go in and sign up for their

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,100
memberships and they can renew them as

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,630
well and it's really a email goes out

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,850
let's say four weeks it's configurable

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,430
email goes out for weeks before the

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,170
expiration of the membership and it

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,220
gives you a unique link you can click on

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,600
that link it will take you to the

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,430
website you don't even have to log in

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,140
it'll pre-fill all that information you

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,620
can edit it if some of that information

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,990
has changed you hit submit payments

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,290
processed and you're done all right

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,720
before this system what did their

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,820
process look like very much go to the

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,160
website download this PDF print it out

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,020
write us a check put it in the mail and

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,880
then somebody will get back to you if we

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,920
can actually read the paper that you

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,720
filled out and we'll let you know that

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,000
you're actually a member of organization

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,640
right now in today's day and age what do

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,440
you think is the likelihood of people

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,360
remember again Driessen the keynote when

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,480
he was talking about different steps it

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,010
takes to do something so if we took it

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,779
out and said okay we have to put a PDF

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,339
up on the website and download it we

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,980
have to go on and print it out we have

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,650
to fill it out we have to you know find

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,089
an envelope and a stamp you know we have

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,390
to mail it in we have to write a check

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,060
right whereas I can just come in here

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,040
and in my slippers and insurance I can

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,580
just fill it out click pay my duties etc

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,650
when we launched this organization's

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,070
website in the first 90 days their

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,270
membership shot up thirty five percent

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,650
they came back to us and say we have

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,920
more about money in our budget can you

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,660
do more all right so people people are

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,030
concerned about the return on investment

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,740
but what's the return on how do you

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,040
measure return on investment in terms of

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,360
engagement of your constituents second

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,170
thing that I want to point out while I'm

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,079
on the topic of kind of real world

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,270
examples is and we see this very very

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,330
frequently every organization is

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,000
extremely concerned about recruiting new

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,330
members recruiting new blood into the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,520
organization right but then you ask them

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,280
and you say well you know you have 3,000

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,800
members and you're really proud of

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,810
yourself because you recruited 300 more

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,510
this year in the last 12 months your

00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,060
membership you

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,650
you have 300 new members so everybody's

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,690
giving high-fives and celebrating

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,570
because they go hey you know that's a

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,960
ten percent growth right just pretty

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:04,730
good when I walk in I usually ask him i

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,100
say so what's your retention rate and

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,460
they kind of tilt their head give me the

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,840
puppy look go what do you mean I said

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,730
out of the three thousand members that

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,490
have been members how many of those

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:23,060
didn't renew the most places don't have

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,560
an idea what that number is and in a

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,830
three thousand member organization that

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,450
number could very well be 200 or 250 now

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,360
sometimes you know especially if it's

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,560
something very local like in Houston

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,660
that might be reasonable because people

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,700
move in and out of the area or something

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,790
like that so they don't have a need to

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,910
be a member anymore but what we found

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,760
out over and over and over again is most

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,340
people don't renew you know why nobody's

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,720
nobody's asked them nobody sent them a

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,700
reminder nobody sent them a little

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,190
tickler and said hey would you like to

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,840
renew again I mean how many of you are a

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,120
member of some kind of an organization

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,000
drupal association most of us here right

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,260
if if I asked you right now when does

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,340
your drupal association membership

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:09,050
expired do you have an idea no you don't

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,730
most people don't we're more than happy

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,220
to support an organization but don't ask

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,990
us to keep track of when that membership

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,820
expires and if you have multiple

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,140
organizational memberships the last

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,850
thing you want to do is keep track of

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,410
that in your calendar so if somebody

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,910
doesn't ask and say hey would you send

00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,250
us another hundred dollars or whatever

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,100
it is for drupal association if they

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,110
don't ask I may not proactively go out

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,910
there and actually do it even though if

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,510
I get that email I will happily do that

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,270
right so that's one of the big things

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,650
that has been taking place with CVC RM

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,950
with this kind of an integrated system

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,870
is that not only you're capitalizing on

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,110
the new blood and new members that are

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:51,170
coming into organizations and new donors

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,910
right it's going back historically and

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,890
asking the same donors the event

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,410
participants etc so now we have a lot of

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,420
clients who go out there and say we had

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,620
a great successful event last year for a

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,600
fundraiser

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,670
instead of trying to go and fill out a

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,320
room of 500 people again why don't we go

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,870
and send an email to the people that

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,660
were there last year I mean that's

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,160
that's probably your best target market

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,070
right there out of the 500 people they

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,840
were out there at last year 250 or 300

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:21,380
of them will probably come right back if

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,710
you ask them all right so let's look at

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,770
the different elements of the of the

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,720
system so as I said the sea contact

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,670
constituent Klein it doesn't matter what

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,040
you want to call it but all of these are

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:37,400
either members or clients or volunteers

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,809
or donors or affiliates I mean it

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,220
doesn't matter it can be an individual

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:42,559
it can be a household it can be a

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,770
company it doesn't really matter it's a

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,860
record okay and from that a lot of other

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,950
things go off there it can even be we

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,260
have organization that use this for

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,120
managing grants as passed through so

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,740
they receive a big grand and then

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,350
they're responsible to pass that grand

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,210
into other community as a matter of fact

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,730
again this morning Holly was talking

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,790
about the community grants that they're

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,559
administering for Drupal 8 all right all

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,440
right so drupal get drupal association

00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,390
gets a grand let's say from aquia that

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,950
says we're going to give away million

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,870
dollars I don't know what their number

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,190
is so don't quote me on this we're going

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,350
to give away million dollars for

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,850
promoting Drupal 8 and community

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,120
development and then drupal association

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:30,020
and can act and have all sorts of

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,990
information in their crm system as they

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,730
distribute it and push it out the beauty

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,760
of this is you can also manage you can

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,160
do like almost like nested contacts so

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,490
you can have a company and then you can

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,850
set up relationships between them and

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,679
the memberships that adds to that so the

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,780
beauty of having everything in the in

00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,800
the contact database is one you can

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,929
segment it so if the Drupal drupalcon

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,910
registration was done in city CRM for

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,980
example we're all here at the event I

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,720
could actually segment the market and

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,340
say I want to send email to everybody

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,429
who signed up in the first two weeks

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,950
that when the registration was open so I

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,240
want to see the first enthusiast because

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,960
I want to target them for a particular

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,700
message right on the contrary I

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,070
could also segment my market and say I

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,740
want to send an email to everybody who

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,720
has registered in the last two weeks

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,880
because maybe they you know we we've all

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,460
been getting these emails periodically

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,870
about drupalcon is coming this is about

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,350
travel arrangements hotel arrangements

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,669
etc all right but if you signed up in

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,350
the last two weeks you might have not

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,480
been in the distribution list so I may

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,520
need to send just to those people just

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,860
to that market segment a particular

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,590
email summarizing everything that's been

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,480
going on for the last several months

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:50,200
right so it allows you to do that and

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,270
the relationship as I just mentioned you

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,340
can set up a variety of relationships

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,169
between individuals between individual

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,419
and companies etc and you can define

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,929
your own so this is not predefined now

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,880
there's relationships like spousal

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,220
relationships or parent children or

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,409
employer employee but then there is a

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,299
lot of relationships where you may not

00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:12,730
even know what those what those are you

00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,039
know it could be a client a vendor

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,140
relationship it could be a grantee grant

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,149
or it could be a lot of other things and

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,830
you can define these on your own and you

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:25,120
can also put permissions and

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:27,580
restrictions on this so want a frequent

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,140
one a frequent requests we get is we

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,730
want to say you know somebody from the

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,860
family or from the company wants to be

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,690
able to edit everybody else's contact

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,840
information all right so you have a like

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,940
one master administrator that edits the

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,770
company information and then actually

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,360
the company address can be linked to the

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,039
individuals so the individual doesn't

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,480
even need to change their address when

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,950
it's changed at the company level it's

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,029
automatically linked think of it like

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:56,710
entities in Drupal all right each

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,140
contact can have a number of activities

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,299
so think of this is a changelog if you

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,490
will but you can define your own

00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:05,529
activities so I can set up an activity

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,320
if I'm using it for sales follow-up or

00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:12,370
donor follow up that says you know this

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,710
is a donor that's very likely to give us

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,120
recurring contributions we need to

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,220
follow up with this person every 90 days

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,860
so I can set up different levels of

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,590
activities and reminders to go along

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,000
with that so what this really allows you

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:30,160
to do is organize maintain and track

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,090
wealth of information about any type of

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:37,150
context you would want to do so the key

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:39,460
features of cv crm as a whole is is

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,380
extensible again it's open source so you

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,990
can download it do it do with it what

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,270
you want they actually within cv crm

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,680
there is a they call it extensions so

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,510
you can actually go and write your own

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,520
extension which is kind of like a module

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:55,200
is to drupal that's kind of like what

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,640
extension is to City CRM and there is

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,950
dozens if not hundreds of them already

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,830
available out there for some very

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,270
particular information for example one I

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,360
can think of off top of my head is

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,150
somebody wrote an extension because they

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,340
were having problem with people editing

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,410
their email address and changing it to

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,030
something that would invalidate all

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:19,030
right so they wrote an extension that

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,770
says that's like an email enforcer which

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,390
basically any field unless you have a

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,810
particular permission it does not allow

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,890
you to change the contacts email address

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,400
that was their particular use case

00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:34,330
scenario point is it is very easily be

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,280
extensible it integrates with CMS so

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,130
your users are synchronized

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,900
automatically between the CMS and CB CRM

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,370
is a mattifying and cv crm on the

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,640
control panel on the summary thing you

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,980
can see there drupal uid so there is a

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,040
UID and a contact ID that is tightly

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,450
linked and that's how it allows you so

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,160
when somebody logs in we can

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,750
automatically redirect them or we can

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,340
even display a little banner that says

00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,130
hey your memberships about to expire in

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,350
four weeks would you like to renew now

00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:06,190
all right so you might have an option to

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,750
send them out an email but maybe it's

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,950
not delivered or maybe then your email

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,930
has changed but they're still logging

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,460
into the website so you're trying to

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,940
ensure that you're capturing your

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,640
members or you can put a you can do a

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,320
user synchronization and an integration

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,910
with the CMS that when somebody logs in

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,010
and let's say you have a fundraiser and

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,740
you know that they have been to other

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,360
events but not to do that fundraiser

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,850
maybe you want to pop up a special

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,710
message or put a special feature in a

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,700
side blog that says I want to advertise

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,700
this to this specific sub group all

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,340
right

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,409
import and export I could spend a whole

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,169
session just talking about importing and

00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,700
exporting data if anybody tells you

00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,590
their data is clean they're lying I

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,309
haven't found a client yet that has

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:55,460
clean data the good part is and I do

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,620
have it I think later on there's a whole

00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,450
deduplication feature so you can try to

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,710
deduplicate and you can set up your own

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,850
criteria of how you want to define

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,620
duplicates here's here's the thing and

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,360
you know we're on software in some way

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,980
or another and you always know people

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,659
always try to lure you in and say come

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,450
in you know give us your facebook login

00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:16,010
give us your linkedin login you know

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,630
we're going to pull in all your contacts

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,000
and everything else right everybody

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:23,389
makes it super easy to get your data

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,490
into their ecosystem right what I always

00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:27,110
ask is don't you know don't don't look

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,130
at how easy it is to get information

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,080
into the system look at how easy or not

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,059
even possible it is to get the data out

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,039
of the system because everybody is

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,169
trying to lock you in this is one thing

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,360
i love about City CRM you want to export

00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,250
your data you can actually define your

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,889
own templates and export it as many

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,519
times and in any way you want it's all

00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:51,049
there and I can tell you a lot of other

00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,480
donor management event management

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,360
systems they will take a lot of data in

00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,820
but they're very very careful about what

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,409
they allow you to export out

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,809
unfortunately and you don't realize that

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:05,480
until it's too late usually or until

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:08,500
it's going to take a lot of effort to

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,789
get that out last but not least is

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,070
search functionality as you can imagine

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,809
having thousands tens of thousands or

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,649
hundreds of thousands of records in cv

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:20,990
CRM in the database not all of them

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:22,940
every Drupal user when they register

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,519
they are automatically created record in

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,519
city CRM but not every city CRM contact

00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,240
not every city serum record has doesn't

00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,080
needs to have a drupal login right

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,580
because you could have just people in

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
the database they'd never log into the

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,799
website so you want to want to junk up

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,740
your user stable right so the search

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,350
within cv crm very powerful you can do

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,929
it by email if you know their cid if you

00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,639
know a partial name match etc etc you

00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:51,650
can define very powerful search engine

00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:56,720
that you can use right from within

00:28:51,650 --> 00:29:01,850
built into it it also works with it has

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:05,360
its own API it works with rules it works

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,490
with entities we've actually enhanced

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,150
the entities at square and we've also

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:13,400
written a there is views integration for

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,690
civ ecrm so you can actually a lot of

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,910
the data that's already available in

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,870
civis erm by default can be pulled out

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:22,820
via views alright and square we took it

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,410
one step further and we have a module

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,800
that we've contributed back that

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,780
basically can expose any table alright

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,440
so even if you have custom data in the

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:36,260
tables or anything like that you can

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,030
access it without any issues whether you

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,680
want to use it on the super serum sat on

00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,480
the drupal site and when I talk about

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,840
Drupal and city CRM site I think the

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,460
only thing to keep in mind there is

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,340
think of Drupal Cano as the front end

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,830
what most users see and think of cv crm

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,320
kind of as the backend your CRM system

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,660
you know most unless you're actually

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,080
using the CRM system most end users

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:04,060
don't get to see a lot of the back end

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,060
any questions so far yes

00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:38,570
okay what was your name nikada so

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:41,210
regardless question was he is thinking

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,979
planning to use city crm in an

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,159
installation that could entail as many

00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:47,989
as five million records and he's not

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,369
sure whether the system is robust and

00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:54,979
scalable enough to accommodate that size

00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:56,330
of a database okay i'll tell you in our

00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,340
own experience I don't think we've been

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,169
quite in the millions but we've been

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:04,999
definitely in the hundreds of thousands

00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:07,039
of records I can also tell you that one

00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,509
particular implementation I can think of

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,149
right off top of my head and somebody

00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:14,529
who I have met at silicon so just like

00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:17,419
there are Drupal cons we have civic ons

00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:19,129
and I spoke to him at length they

00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:22,429
implemented this with the New York State

00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:23,960
Senate and they truly have millions of

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,369
records in there and they're using it

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,950
for a lot of other things so I would not

00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,989
necessarily be afraid of conceived ecrm

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,399
handle it now I will tell you the

00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,710
underlying infrastructure you know

00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,940
you're not going to put this on your

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,509
run-of-the-mill shared hosting for

00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:42,739
twenty dollars a month so you're not

00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:43,999
going to do that okay but you will need

00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:45,859
to you know you will need to look at

00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,599
your mysql settings that's not going to

00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,769
be just the you know you're my conf is

00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,450
not going to be just a default

00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:56,239
configuration etc but i wouldn't have

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,309
any doubts that you can handle I mean

00:31:56,239 --> 00:32:00,289
think of Wikimedia I think you might

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,330
have walked in just after I showed the

00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:04,429
wikimedia foundation and they did a

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,320
presentation last year at civic on and

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:10,989
again don't quote me on the number but I

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,989
know they have millions of records so

00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:38,549
okay the extensible part that I was just

00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,289
talking about there is a hole I don't

00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,570
know again if it's an extension or like

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,820
a module or something something I don't

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,619
want to misrepresent the level at which

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,889
its integrated but there is a whole

00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:52,320
effort called CVS MS as a matter of fact

00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:54,690
I remember last year we helped organize

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,629
the square help sponsor and organize the

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,369
Civic owns every year nowadays and I

00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:02,009
remember one of the presentations at the

00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:03,779
last civic on was not just the fact that

00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:06,269
we can reach out just like you know we

00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,769
send out bulk email to people but there

00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:11,099
is actually a use case scenario where

00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:13,919
somebody has configured several services

00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:16,289
and integrated it into CB crm where we

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,320
can send you out a text message and you

00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:21,299
can actually reply to it and depending

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,059
on what you reply we put it through a

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:26,070
rules engine and reply back so if i send

00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,359
it to this room each and every one of

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,369
you might get the same or similar

00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,710
initial message i mean we can customize

00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:33,239
even the initial message going out but

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,029
then we give you three or five options

00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:38,089
to respond back with and you almost draw

00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,589
it up like a tree and say okay if

00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:42,330
ricotta to goes in and responds with one

00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:44,369
and then we respond back with this and

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,169
if you responds this then we look at his

00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:48,450
last two responses and based on that we

00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:50,219
present him with something else so you

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,589
can do a lot of a lot of things like

00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:54,450
that and you can use it also in the

00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:55,830
search functionality is great when you

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,969
have somebody on the phone that calls

00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:03,779
you up and in our practice we've done a

00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:05,940
lot of implementations where the city

00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,240
crm is being either imported or is being

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,799
tied to a third-party database so it

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,099
might be another corporate database or

00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:17,849
something like that there is a field

00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,529
that's I don't want to call it reserved

00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:23,039
free but is a special field called

00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:24,690
external ID so cv crm is kind of

00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,580
anticipated that people are either going

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,280
to be bringing in day

00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,950
or interacting with other databases so

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,100
it city CRM itself has its own contact

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:37,520
ID it has a table that cross references

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:41,210
to Drupal user IDs but it also has this

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,740
external ID field where we can tie it to

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,080
a third-party database because we know

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,030
that that database actually keeps track

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,190
of the same person via different ID so

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,740
if you wanted to tie it to a third-party

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,970
database that could very well be

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,700
something you might want to take a look

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:58,220
at using that's like again you can set

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:02,000
up any number of custom fields and you

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:04,250
can keep track of five different unique

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,560
IDs from different systems and you can

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:10,850
call them with via AP eyes or any any

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,730
other ways with the code but the the

00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,650
external ID that's built into civvy crm

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,900
it even pops up when you're trying to do

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,160
an import it a student says are you

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,960
giving me something and should I match

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,350
on email address or should I match on

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,080
CBC RM ID or should I met Ron on

00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:32,390
external ID so it already is aware of

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,430
that some more key features access

00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:38,930
control as you can imagine with a lot of

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,240
this data it can get pretty involved in

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,580
terms of privacy in terms of security of

00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,060
who has access to what so very similar

00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,950
you know in Drupal I mean civie CRM has

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,110
Drupal permissions that you can

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,640
configure but then also with in civvy

00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,370
CRM you can actually set up your own

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,940
subgroups and you can set up your own

00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:01,940
access control all the way down to the

00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,740
field level so if you have some kind of

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,830
a you know in the United States we have

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,150
social security ID in you know other

00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,360
countries you have some kind of a unique

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,610
identifier or or identification card or

00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,530
something like that you may not want

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,270
everybody to see that just because they

00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,440
have access to cv crm they may not want

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,990
to see something that's very you know

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,590
date of birth or the aggregate number of

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,840
contributions right so you can very

00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,480
finely control the access control I've

00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,640
mentioned the custom fields you can

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,770
actually take custom fields and design

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,820
them by the different entity so you can

00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,100
have custom fields that are only

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,150
associated with individual contacts you

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,410
can have custom fields that are

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,869
associated let's say with an event

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,970
it so if I'm go if I'm putting up an

00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,020
event I'm I adding a custom field that

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:50,089
says meal preference right meat fish

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,690
vegetarian vegan you can put any number

00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:56,119
of things there the good news is now

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,440
that might not be the best example for

00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,119
it for an event because really that's

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,680
and that's a preference associated with

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,299
the individual right so you probably

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,089
want to would want to add that custom

00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:06,680
field at the contact level those chances

00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,180
are from a vegetarian today and I

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,460
register for another event a year from

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:14,289
now I'm chances are i'm still vegetarian

00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,849
okay but there might be some preferences

00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:18,410
for an event and i'm trying to think of

00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,819
what would be a good you know good

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,619
preference for an event but you can

00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:23,599
actually do it and just tie to the event

00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,059
so it doesn't pop up necessarily on the

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,789
individual contact but i can say for

00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,530
that particular event that custom field

00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,530
I filled out is that you know in my

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:36,470
registration it's going to show up

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,750
here's one do I want a t-shirt or do I

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,789
want a mug or do I want another gift

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,140
when I register alright so that's a

00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:45,260
custom field that you can put at an

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,049
event level right just because I Peter

00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,880
Patrick chose a t-shirt today doesn't

00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:51,470
mean I want a t-shirt next time but it's

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,450
a custom feel that goes at a different

00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,569
level it goes at the registration for

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:58,640
that particular event virtually

00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:00,829
unlimited number of custom fields you

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,180
can actually aggregate them into custody

00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:07,579
into field groups and for Ricardo's

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,109
question in regards to what happens when

00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,400
you want to do some like collect data

00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:12,529
over the phone or something like that

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,619
we've done a number of these where we

00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:17,089
would design a what's called a profile

00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,029
in city serum which is basically a

00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:22,099
collection of fields and groups of

00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:24,710
fields right with the necessary

00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:26,450
information so people are calling in to

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,010
a call center and you're just getting

00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,230
their information and you don't want to

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,819
go through all the screens that city CRM

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,970
gives you and all the options because

00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:37,460
you just need to collect eight pieces of

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:41,240
information first name last name email

00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:44,000
address phone number you know something

00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,670
very basic so we can design and I think

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,079
I actually have that on one of the

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,910
slides about the profile so you can

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,490
design a profile and have that be

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,440
exposed just like a little form and you

00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,840
keep hitting submit and it keeps adding

00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,640
things to the database so you can do

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,410
that and then the profiles can also be

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,930
added again to an event registration

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,240
form I can add that profile so you can

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,100
configure almost like a template right

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,930
and next time you do an event you don't

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,390
have to go and drag each individual

00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:14,330
field and remember what you put out over

00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:18,140
there you can just like a preset profile

00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,730
fields deduplication which is a pretty

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,840
big deal I mean if you have a 5 million

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,300
cotton now I will tell you one thing

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,680
with five million contacts you will have

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,500
to be very careful how you're on

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,080
deduplication okay because if you have

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,750
even with tens of thousands of records

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,840
when you're trying to say you know

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,490
Ricardo what's your last name okay I'm

00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,950
not going to try to pronounce that but

00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:42,920
if Ricardo if I'm trying to identify if

00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:45,710
there is a Ricardo has duplicate records

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,000
in his database right and I have a

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,190
hundred thousand or two hundred or three

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,440
hundred thousand records it's possible

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,230
to run it but it's not going to be very

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,610
resource efficient so what we've done

00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,560
for clients that have those kind of

00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,470
large installations we recommend

00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,119
basically breaking it down and say okay

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,460
let's run through let's say ten thousand

00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,200
at a time and again I'll reference

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,700
Wikimedia they have a big issue with

00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,380
this because a lot of times people come

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,840
to wikimedia and they don't want you to

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,730
know who's donating money all right or

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,590
they so we can media will take any

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,800
donation and they don't require really

00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,780
virtually any information about you well

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,060
good luck trying to duplicate that data

00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,990
set so they have they have a system that

00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,510
they're going to be contributing

00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:29,630
hopefully back into city crm where you

00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,220
can actually batch deduplication

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,020
assignments so you can assign hundred

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,700
contacts to this person hundred context

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,619
to this person and hundred so when the

00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,140
system runs it Flags everything is a

00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,150
potential duplicate but then it assigns

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,130
you can use volunteers you can use staff

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,190
etc you can just have these mini batches

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,260
of can you it need some kind of human

00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,000
intervention and some kind of reality

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,380
check so can you look at these hundred

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,359
records and then it doesn't become so

00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,910
overwhelming to say we're trying to

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,470
deduplicate five million records at that

00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,150
point it becomes what can we do 100 at a

00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,770
time and it's going to take some time

00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,950
and it's going to be resource intensive

00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:06,780
but it's very much possible

00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,760
tracking so any kind of tracking the

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,170
part of it is the activities we've

00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,560
started using it some time ago for even

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:18,150
adding activities to you know let's say

00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,310
personalization somebody comes in and we

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,620
know it's Ricardo or we know it's

00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,360
Sebastian coming into our website we

00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,430
might actually create an activity in

00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,370
their record that says they've already

00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:31,680
come so next time they come we already

00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,450
know that they're not a first time

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,460
visitor and we need to change their

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,740
experience of what they're looking at on

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,280
the website so we can do a lot of things

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:44,520
like that and again last but certainly

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,530
not least mapping you can create your

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,770
own mapping you can export things out

00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,960
you can geocode it all the addresses etc

00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,420
so if you want to have a directory of

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,220
members for the organization or you want

00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,430
to see where all your contributors are

00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:03,750
located etc you can you can do it all of

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:05,670
that and you can search by by location

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,310
so you can say you know like in the

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,020
United States it would be we have a zip

00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,870
code and I want to find everybody that's

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,580
within 10 miles of that zip code so you

00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,470
can do that there and again all of this

00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,720
information if you don't like what city

00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,130
CRM particularly how it presents and

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,750
everything you can either write an

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,940
extension or do it yourself in civvy

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,390
serum or you can grab it through views

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,270
and Drupal you know entities and you can

00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,410
play with it to your heart's content so

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,900
there's a lot of different use case

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,160
scenarios here alright so we've got a

00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,480
few more minutes left here so let's look

00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,460
at some of the components and some of

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,440
the functionalities behind it so the

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,580
four there is the city contribute these

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,460
are these are not this is not an

00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,320
exhaustive list city contribute

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,690
obviously manages even though it says

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,910
contribute it really is all money coming

00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:54,120
in all right so donations event

00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:56,220
registration payments any money coming

00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,780
in is right here and so we contribute cv

00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,550
member that's membership tracking and

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,950
again that doesn't necessarily have to

00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,510
be a membership it could be just an

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,250
annual subscription of some kind or

00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,470
something like that so you could use

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,360
that for that civ event event

00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,370
registrations of email sending out bulk

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,650
email all right so whether you've been

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,600
using MailChimp passivity or a constant

00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,839
contact or something like that you can

00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,119
actually have something

00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,829
built-in right here and again on the

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,390
front end it allows you to customize and

00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:24,729
segment what you want to do then you can

00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:28,029
use your tokens including your custom

00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:29,739
fields and ship out all your emails as a

00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:33,279
matter of fact the latest release of CB

00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:35,380
crm now has a be testing so you can send

00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:36,640
out 100 emails over here and hundred

00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,710
emails over here and you can track

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,219
independently the response to two

00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:44,380
different email campaigns or same email

00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:49,239
campaign but two different ways of

00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:50,829
presenting it right ricardo so you're

00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:52,180
asking about marketing automation tell

00:43:50,829 --> 00:44:03,369
me more about what what you're looking

00:43:52,180 --> 00:44:05,710
for so the question is how does the web

00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:08,469
page change depending on the visitor and

00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:12,339
I would say this is a combination of cv

00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:14,109
crm and drupal really so we can send out

00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:15,640
emails and you can have a hash so we

00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,200
know who received that email and when

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,329
you click on it and you come to the

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,400
website we know that's the person with

00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:23,079
that email hash that came in so that's

00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,670
the functionality that you can do that

00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,680
now what you do with it you can hook it

00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,499
up the rules you can hook it up to any

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,239
number of modules to present we're

00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:33,400
working with a number of clients right

00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:36,819
now that are taking personalization to a

00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,859
whole different level well we've been

00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:42,369
doing is setting up wildcard domains

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:43,989
right so like square calm but now when

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:46,299
we send you an email it actually doesn't

00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,880
have this long string of hash code and

00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:52,599
everything else it just says Ricardo dot

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,729
square calm and when you arrive it's the

00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,979
regular square calm page but we know

00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:59,859
it's ricarda now we know this is your

00:44:56,979 --> 00:45:01,539
first visit we're doing it for a lot of

00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:03,249
let's say educational institutions that

00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:05,109
are recruiting new students you're

00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:06,999
coming in and we say Oh Ricardo now we

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,339
go back into the database because in a

00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:12,640
custom field we have stored or in a

00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:14,650
relationship we have a record of who's

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,809
been assigned as your advisor because we

00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,819
know which high school you went to and

00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:20,650
what was your major so we've already

00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,289
assigned you an advisor that's a that's

00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,279
an expert on that particular major

00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:26,739
because we know you're probably going to

00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:29,229
start computer science right but

00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:29,960
Sebastian might be a liberal arts person

00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,130
so we

00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,170
assign him to a difference so the

00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:35,950
picture that shows up when you come to

00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:39,140
Ricardo square calm and when you come to

00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,510
Sebastien de square calm you're going to

00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,160
actually see structurally perhaps some

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,220
similarities in the page right

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,109
navigation etc but you're going to see

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,280
different information and you're going

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:50,540
to see different information depending

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,970
on what we're pulling out of our

00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,280
database on the back end here some very

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,440
very neat stuff here we can actually

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,820
embed maps because we know your address

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,230
now we know that you came to our

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,119
websites and say why don't you come and

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,400
visit our location here and no here's

00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:09,200
the map it's only you know 13 kilometers

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,670
away things of that nature so we can do

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,260
it we can do a lot of things with

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,119
customizations here and then of course

00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,500
you have token and then again we know

00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:17,780
that you've arrived at the website

00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,760
depending on the level of authentication

00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,900
that we're wanting to put in there we

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,520
might want you to log in with your

00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,990
Facebook which allows us to collect a

00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,550
little bit more information about you

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,130
but at the same time then you're logged

00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:30,109
in and so when you click on ya I want to

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,050
come in for an on-site visit of your

00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:35,359
university or your organization we can

00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,460
already pre-fill have to form a big part

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,280
of the form because we already have that

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,869
information in the database and you're

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,589
looking at it and hopefully validating

00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:48,790
it there are other components called CB

00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:53,869
report that's reporting mechanism their

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:55,250
cv pledge for peer-to-peer campaigns I'm

00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,020
going to pause here for a second because

00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,480
it's a in terms of the components

00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,520
because i want to mention a specific

00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,720
line that we've designed it came to us

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,119
and they said you know we always go to

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,640
our donors to our alumni and basically

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,190
it's a one-way conversation hi we're

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,630
such an such university dlm night please

00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,980
give us money because we're trying to

00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,720
fund some scholarship because we're

00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,089
trying to build a new building etc etc

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,290
right and a lot of people are smiling

00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:20,630
and nodding so you know what I'm talking

00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,640
about right it's a very one-way street

00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,369
we go out and ask and the alumni maybe

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,750
donates back right and they kind of said

00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:30,650
you know maybe we want to do something

00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:33,320
different what if we try to fundraise in

00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,480
a method kind of like a Kickstarter and

00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,339
kind of like have you seen like the

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,930
walkathons when people say ok I'm going

00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:40,970
to go and I'm going to participate in

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,660
this race oh I'm going to walk you know

00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,819
50 miles and for every mile I walk

00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,890
I'm going to you know engage my friends

00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:49,990
and they're all going to contribute a

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,520
dollar a mile or fifty cents a mile or

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:55,079
something like that right have you seen

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:59,970
those before so we actually went out and

00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:03,160
use this peer-to-peer of fundraising

00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:04,869
methodology integrated with cv crm and

00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,049
deployed in major university in the

00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:10,420
united states and so they have this kind

00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:12,880
of a cross between a kickstarter and a

00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,530
walkathon fundraising thing so now it's

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,079
not the university just going out to its

00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,849
alumni they were smart enough to realize

00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,760
hey our alumni are probably our best

00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,020
advocates right and a lot of these

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,579
people you know when they're having a

00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,140
birthday party or something or they want

00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:27,910
to fundraise money or they're going to

00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,490
go into their office and get people

00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:33,520
active around a particular cause they're

00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,440
our best salespeople right and imagine

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,520
what it's like when let's say you have

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,589
50,000 alumni and those 50,000 alumni

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,210
can tap into their network now you're

00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:45,579
going to like two levels of separation

00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,410
right things that you never had access

00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:49,660
to now you're allowing people to say

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,510
come on this website create your own

00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,740
profile page right so Carlos comes in

00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,690
since I'm in alumni going to create a

00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,670
page but next time you're wanting to get

00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,349
engaged in the community or something or

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,760
fundraise money you might say to all

00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:01,990
your friends and say hey I'm really

00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,750
passionate about what the school is

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,270
doing please go and donate here or be

00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,819
part of my team a lot of different

00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:11,829
options that can happen there and they

00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:14,650
see some smiles and not so I think you

00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:19,119
guys are starting to relate to this they

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:20,500
launched this in November and the return

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,930
on investment for them has been

00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,700
fantastic the feedback from the alumni

00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,799
was like you know it's my 40 years or

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,690
50th birthday and I had this big party

00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:30,520
and I don't need another gag gift and I

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,619
don't need people donating so i just

00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,859
created a page that says you know Peters

00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:38,859
50th birthday I'm not 50 yet Peter's

00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:40,359
50th birthday and you know hundreds of

00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:42,190
my friends that showed up to my party

00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:43,510
they donated some twenty dollars some

00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:46,359
hundred dollars some some five hundred

00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,680
dollars because they knew that giving me

00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,349
a present wasn't going to be as

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,890
meaningful as me supporting my

00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:56,380
university and they've had many many

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,480
many people go on the website created

00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,600
these pages created

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,910
these teams and create these campaigns

00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:08,190
and fundraise a lot of money since

00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:10,440
November there is a whole HR system that

00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:13,500
works with civvy CRM it's called cbh are

00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,140
appropriately that's in very active

00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,869
development especially in developing

00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:21,540
developing countries and there is a

00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:23,880
non-profit out of England out of the UK

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,800
that's funding a lot of that development

00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,640
and then there is another company in

00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,410
India that's actually going out to

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,270
nonprofits that need managing the

00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:36,200
volunteers and everything else so city

00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:39,359
HR has become a big big thing there

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,540
there is an effort to make this all

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,859
mobile as we know that's a very

00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,290
important thing and certainly on the

00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:49,050
front end it's well you know you can you

00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:50,609
can theme it but it's also the back and

00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,500
the administrative side of you know

00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:54,270
we're coming into an event and we're

00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,430
checking people in we have a

00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,290
registration roll we know who's

00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,760
registered but now we want to check

00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,530
people off and say they actually

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,859
participated here the functionality is

00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,960
there to know who has come and gone or

00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:08,430
who's comin who didn't come but we're

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,700
trying to streamline a lot of those

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,320
things now on CB case city grand and

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,170
again don't forget all the extensions

00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,340
that are available alright I'm going to

00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,800
pause here make sure there are no

00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:23,160
questions I know we're kind of got a lot

00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,560
of time going on here I can talk about

00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,180
I've got the slides that are prepared

00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,119
for any of these components if you want

00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,740
to delve into any specifics of these I

00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,210
can talk about some more of the

00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,880
community and ideas and I'm certainly

00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:38,490
happy to entertain some questions and

00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,550
provide answers to the extent that I can

00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:43,260
so is this kind of audience decision

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:48,480
point of which way does the presentation

00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,670
go what does everybody think

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,640
questions okay so we have some questions

00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:57,840
in the audience some questions and it

00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:07,050
Ricardo's got questions all right so let

00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:08,520
me take a look here really quickly let

00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,430
me see here let me let me go through

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,650
here let me just finish off a few things

00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,530
here that I still have prepared in terms

00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:18,119
of how do you get started I know I met a

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,560
number of you before we started the

00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,540
presentation today and you said you've

00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,580
already tried to play with it or it was

00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,470
a few years back so let me just say you

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,630
know what does it take to go live or

00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,460
what does it take to get engaged with CB

00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,430
CRM first of all I would strongly

00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,750
encourage you start planning okay this

00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,660
is certainly you can go out there

00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,340
download it and start using it but it

00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,900
will require some planning in terms of

00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,390
you know how are you going to lay out

00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,040
your data relationships where are you

00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:47,070
going to store information how you're

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,410
going to validate it geocoded etc so you

00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:52,650
definitely need to set up some kind of a

00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,850
plan of action and presumably you're not

00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,380
going to be starting from scratch so

00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,640
you're going to have some existing data

00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,369
so how are you going to you know

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:06,359
migrated etc so that's a a lot of things

00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:08,900
that go into planning their budget and I

00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:11,220
don't just mean financial budget

00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,830
allocate some resources whether it's to

00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,980
deduplication or to the migration or to

00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:18,780
the data import or configuring you know

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,880
again you can go through the let's say

00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,530
the membership system and you can we had

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,380
our organizations that had nine

00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,730
different levels of membership and

00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,920
within those levels of membership you

00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,570
can define when you want to consider

00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,369
somebody a new member when you want to

00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,130
consider them just in a regular cycle

00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:36,660
when they're about to expire how long of

00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,520
a grace period you want to give them you

00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,900
know some people say it expired

00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,240
yesterday today you don't have access

00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,280
right other organizations say well you

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,980
know what we want to give them access

00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,530
but it may be limited and only for two

00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,240
weeks all right so you have to go in and

00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,980
configure it and you really have to

00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,460
budget for those kind of resources to be

00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,960
able to do it management process manage

00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,630
it like a process managers like any

00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,980
other project you know again this is not

00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,240
something I

00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,800
say this is something like hey let me

00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,990
download this small module plug it in

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,790
and see what it does you know you really

00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:12,150
have to manage this as a project because

00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:14,520
you're dealing with a lot of data some

00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,390
of the costs in terms of that is you

00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,920
know you have to look at the

00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,990
implementation so the software is free

00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,960
just like with Drupal but you do have to

00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:24,180
look at implementation costs even if

00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,090
that cost is just your time all right

00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,980
just like with Drupal then you have to

00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:30,990
go in and decide on all the

00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,580
configurations all right what do I want

00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,770
how do I want it and this is where it

00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,750
helps and we've been approached a number

00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,609
of times it's square now where people

00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,650
come to us and say no we've got internal

00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:42,810
developers or even other Drupal shops

00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,030
that are doing some implementations or

00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,859
some nonprofits that are much bigger and

00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,930
actually have on staff developers they

00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:51,270
come to us and say can you be a

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,710
technical advisor and help us understand

00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,090
how to configure it because all the

00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,859
options we don't necessarily want to go

00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,210
through every one of them and figure out

00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,590
what's right for us we just want to tell

00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,730
you you know where we're trying to get

00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,890
to and you tell us what the right

00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:04,890
configuration is so that that could be a

00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:06,330
cost we kind of mentioned hosting in

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,180
terms of you know depending on how much

00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:11,100
data you have etc there are some hosts

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,260
and if you go in city CRM org there is a

00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:16,410
whole list of host companies that

00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,150
support City crm you can run this on

00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:20,220
your local if you just want to play with

00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:23,040
it in your wampum amp or you know any

00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,480
kind of installation but again once you

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,900
start loading in data and you expect

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,180
people to interact with it etc you know

00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,890
you're going to find shared hosting only

00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,359
goes so far let's put it that way you

00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,850
know I'm not going to say can't work on

00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,230
it but it only goes so far so that's

00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,350
going to be a cost and then you have to

00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:43,950
look at the possibility of upgrades you

00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:45,750
know what what is going to be your path

00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,950
going forward because chances are you're

00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,200
not going to just put this in and take

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,090
your hands off the wheel all right so

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,890
that's all the kind of costs again this

00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,800
is not just financial some of it is

00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:58,140
human resources and speaking of

00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,020
resources I would encourage you going to

00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,670
cv CRMs org there is forums out there

00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,070
there's documentation there's a whole

00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:08,700
ebook you can download an ePub format or

00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:11,520
PDF that walks you through a lot of the

00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,930
functionalities of cv crm that was

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,030
actually one of the things i personally

00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,310
have worked on during

00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:19,330
in the code Sprint's is improving the

00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:21,350
documentation you'll find a list of

00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:23,920
people that provide services and

00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:26,570
partners square is one of the founding

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,310
partners of the super serum partnership

00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:33,740
program and then there's the e-book look

00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:36,800
at the community so there is a civic on

00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,950
which is taking place it's in the second

00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:43,040
part of april of this year in denver so

00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:44,900
if you want to come and check out Civic

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,490
on now there is a second civic on that

00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,970
usually takes place in Europe generally

00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:52,070
in London just about the week before the

00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:54,320
European drupalcon so usually in the

00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:57,680
September timeframe so if you happen to

00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,770
be in Europe around that time and then

00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,170
also usually in the earlier part of

00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,870
September I believe is a CV CRM user

00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:08,510
summit that takes place in Washington DC

00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,400
or has traditionally and I think that's

00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:12,170
what's going to continue there is

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,060
usually trainings just like with Drupal

00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:18,950
cons there's trainings associated with

00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:20,360
these events hashtag cv crm is well

00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,610
obviously if you search on twitter

00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,610
you'll find it but that hashtag actually

00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:29,200
is for IRC channel so if you can if

00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:33,110
you're on IRC jump on City CRM ask and

00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,480
globally we just about two weeks ago we

00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:37,400
had what's called a civvie day is one

00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,680
day where globally everybody organizes

00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,920
meet up and has presentations and

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,780
introduces people to the ecosystem so

00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,790
there is a lot of them we had over i

00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:49,430
want to say over 30 different locations

00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:52,640
around the world participating in this

00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:55,070
CB day meetup effort and a lot of those

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,560
are an ongoing like we host square hosts

00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:01,070
the one in dallas and we've been hosting

00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:02,360
it for four or five years now so we have

00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,860
a lot of people that are on our mailing

00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,900
list we have a lot of people that we

00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,780
invite and we generally just pick a

00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,450
topic and where we like there's going to

00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:15,650
be actually one this thursday while i'm

00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:17,750
here we're hosting one in dallas that's

00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,900
what we call just bring your own problem

00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,310
BYO so people come in you know they

00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,980
might have a local installation or on

00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:26,600
the server yay i'm struggling with

00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,150
something i can't figure this out this

00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,370
concept

00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:33,600
really strange to me what can I do with

00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:37,050
it all right so that really is kind of

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,090
the summary of civic CRM and we're going

00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:41,520
to get to the QA one thing I would like

00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:45,450
to ask you is please please please go to

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:50,970
the drupalcon website and go to this

00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:53,550
note 3 29 33 293 guess and fill out the

00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:55,410
evaluation for this session they've

00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:58,920
asked us to not just mention it but

00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:02,640
really encourage you to go there and

00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:06,420
fill out the evaluation it helps the

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:10,590
drupalcon to do better next time alright

00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:12,600
so that's my part of this of talking

00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:14,670
about it but I know you have questions

00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,070
so I certainly appreciate everybody

00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,990
being here and the sponsors and the

00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,050
organizers and the volunteers I saw a

00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:24,300
couple of you here with the volunteer

00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:25,800
badge so thanks for putting this on

00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,020
because I think it's a fantastic event

00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,840
to expand drupal and and the entire

00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:41,250
ecosystem around it into latin america

00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:43,290
so thank you for that questions okay so

00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:45,540
the question is about business

00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:47,670
intelligence tools and I would say

00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:51,000
that's a market that's starting to

00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:53,520
evolve interview no data is obviously

00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,990
there it's a MySQL database so if you

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,050
have a third party tool you want to use

00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:00,780
you can certainly use it there is a very

00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:03,290
advanced API that you can use within

01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,940
city CRM which is also a good thing and

01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:08,460
i would say that there are a lot of

01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,550
efforts to take like drupal and the

01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:14,490
views integration and things like that

01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:16,920
one of the it's in beta right now what

01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:19,350
we've developed at square is what we

01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,720
call CBC RM dashlets you can take a

01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,190
nugget of information maybe I just want

01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,680
to see how many people registered

01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:28,560
yesterday for a particular event or in

01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:31,860
the last week or what's the value of my

01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:33,690
donations over the last 30 days now you

01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:36,990
can already do that today and put it on

01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:38,520
in like a little line report but

01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,410
wouldn't it be nicer to be able to break

01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,360
it out and say for this event we had

01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,640
55 people that register there are

01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:48,090
students three people that are you know

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,070
developers and two people that are you

01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:51,630
know interns and complete newbies and

01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:53,700
you can put it into a nice little pie

01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:55,860
chart or something and you can embed it

01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,810
into a dashboard or page or a block or

01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,400
something like that so there is a lot of

01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:01,140
effort going into the business

01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,510
intelligence behind it because we're

01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,760
aware of how much data is available here

01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:08,430
it's the central point of data

01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,530
repository and now there's severe report

01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:12,090
that you can write your own reports but

01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:15,590
it's more about the graphing and more

01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:15,590
about connecting the data now

01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:41,590
okay so the question is on integration

01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:45,670
I'll just say third-party systems and I

01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:47,050
would say very much ongoing effort and

01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,840
it depends on the system we've done a

01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:52,330
number of these third-party

01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:54,760
implementations and at some point you

01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:57,250
know here's the thing it depends two

01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,260
things that are dependent sometimes you

01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,360
might want to make Drupal kind of your

01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:05,020
integration platform and CBC REM being

01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:07,120
just one of the legs of that integration

01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:09,400
and then erp it really connects more to

01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,680
Drupal than to civvy crm in certain

01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:16,180
instances in other instances you can

01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:18,460
integrate it into city crm and you can

01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,830
you can drive it that way and then your

01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,780
second decision point is are you trying

01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:24,520
to get data in are you trying to get

01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,070
data out are you trying to have two-way

01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,570
communication okay if you're trying to

01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:30,550
have two-way communication certainly you

01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,710
want to be using API where there is on

01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,600
the Drupal or civvy CRM side the

01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:37,120
university I mentioned earlier where we

01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,130
did the development they needed specific

01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,680
data that was going to be pushed because

01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:44,170
they have a separate donor database so

01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,600
this kind of a Kickstarter crowdfunding

01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:48,100
to was on their website and it was old

01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,080
city serum driven and soul self

01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:52,060
contained but they didn't want to miss

01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,770
out on the information that was coming

01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,870
in through there and they wanted to feed

01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,310
it into their donor management system

01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:59,680
which is used across the entire

01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:01,000
university so we built an integration

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,460
between those two systems so it's

01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,720
certainly possible to do third party

01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:11,290
system integration here and say that

01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:13,110
again yeah so you can do it again via

01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:16,390
the API you can do it as a web service

01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:18,850
and this is again the good part of civic

01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:21,100
CRM is tightly integrated with Drupal so

01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:23,920
if you can get to that data in Drupal

01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:26,200
even you can set up a you know endpoint

01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,680
in Drupal and have that be serving data

01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,580
where you're now intermixing saying

01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,470
something like okay here's data where I

01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:37,780
want to get at specific data about

01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:39,490
members and I want to also pull out the

01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,610
last time they logged into the system

01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:43,210
okay so one the membership stuff you

01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,400
would be pulling

01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,750
out of the database from CBC RM because

01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,270
that's where that's being kept track

01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:51,099
track of all right that's the tracking

01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,330
mechanism there but then then Drupal's

01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:58,050
going to give you the date stamp of when

01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:58,050
was the last time they logged in okay

01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:09,730
the question is on voice over IP

01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:10,960
integration and I don't know any off top

01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,570
of my head I know we've had discussions

01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,349
about it on the CB CRM part but I'm not

01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:19,630
one hundred percent sure right now yeah

01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:21,280
there is a drupal module and again this

01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,430
is this is where the discussion gets

01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,599
very blended because some things that

01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,460
you might want to do even the

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,020
third-party database integration is it

01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,300
really a Drupal question or is it really

01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,700
a civvie CRM question and so it's kind

01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,830
of like this with Drupal so a lot of

01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,780
times what we find is people are trying

01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,359
to blend in multiple information and I

01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:43,480
think Drupal is an extremely well-suited

01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:47,200
to for that blending of information and

01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,359
again this goes it goes back to dresses

01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,460
keynote from this morning where he said

01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:53,830
right Drupal has that aggregator module

01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:56,530
Drupal has that capability to pull all

01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,330
of it together and present it out and

01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,770
again that just depends on your use case

01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,869
scenario so you might want to kind of

01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,339
punch some holes in civvy CRM and say

01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,450
okay we're going to expose this and

01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:06,580
people are going to feed us information

01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:09,040
we're going to pull things directly into

01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,440
CB CRM right but then you might have

01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,730
other use cases where you say even

01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,349
though this is coming in through civvy

01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:16,810
CRM we're actually going to hand it off

01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:19,359
to Drupal because that's that engine

01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:22,390
with in Drupal the aggregation happens

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:25,210
from even more endpoints and then Drupal

01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:27,930
itself could be an endpoint to add

01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,930
another system

01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:36,200
learning curve in civis erm I think it's

01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:38,510
just like with any other system you know

01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,220
it's a complex system it's big I would

01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,780
not say again to me this is not

01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,369
something where you know you download a

01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,520
simple module you enable it and you

01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:47,839
check a couple boxes and you're using it

01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,640
but again there is trainings there is

01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,790
documentation there is a very strong

01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,220
community around it and you know I've

01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:57,369
thrown a lot of possibilities out here

01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:01,970
as far as what's available out there in

01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:04,369
practice we rarely see implementations

01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:06,170
where people take on everything at once

01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:08,290
as a matter of fact I would it's kind of

01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:10,430
like drupal saying you know there's

01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:13,400
20,000 modules out there well how many

01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:15,589
are using on any given website right you

01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,839
know 1,500 at them you know whatever

01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:20,150
your whatever your your needs are but

01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,770
it's nowhere near what's all available

01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,420
out there and I think that's kind of the

01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,010
way to look at cv crm this is not

01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,960
something that you enable and you try to

01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:30,380
use hundred percent of it this is

01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,670
something you enable even today I got an

01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,890
email from a client of ours that

01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,630
basically said we've gone through

01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:37,040
implementation we really love what we

01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:39,319
have now we're ready for the next phase

01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,940
all right so really I would break this

01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:42,920
down into phases and say okay what's the

01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,660
minimum viable product and then what's

01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,660
the next layer and what's the next layer

01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,069
and how can we grow you know it's again

01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:51,560
goes back to the continuous integration

01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:53,150
and continuous improvement you know this

01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:56,089
is not a system where you just jump in

01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:58,579
put it in deploy it and forget about it

01:06:56,089 --> 01:07:01,910
this is more of how can we get to market

01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:03,770
in a reasonable time and cost and then

01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:05,450
depending us this is the other thing

01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:08,230
that I've seen happening again this is

01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:11,420
not savvy serum specific in particular

01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:13,130
but what we have seen happen is you know

01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:15,380
people think they need something in a

01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:17,660
project and when you give them the first

01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,010
part of the minimum viable product and

01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,930
they actually start using it they

01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,490
realize a lot of the things they thought

01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:24,260
they were going to need they don't

01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,609
actually need it and they need something

01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,500
else because now they get feedback from

01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:30,770
users or something new has happened in

01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,630
the market etc so you know in terms of

01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:35,690
learning curve implementation costs I

01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,339
would say the key here is know what your

01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,780
minimum viable product is what is it

01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:42,020
going to take to actually use it and

01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:43,490
then be open to shifting the goals and

01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:46,310
the phases as

01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:48,440
I'm goes on and as CV CRM evolves day

01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:50,840
right now they're on about like every

01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,610
six month release schedule right so

01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,220
every I mean they're they're releasing

01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:57,110
minor releases but the kind of more

01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,700
significant releases where more

01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:02,180
functionality and everything else takes

01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:04,310
place that happens about every six

01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,840
months and you don't have to upgrade

01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:07,369
your what you're using is fine you know

01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:11,060
you don't have to upgrade just like with

01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:14,060
Drupal but there might be a lot of neat

01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:17,240
features and improvements and bugs and

01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:24,040
performance improvements that you might

01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:24,040
want to take advantage of yes please

01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:45,200
yeah okay so so the question the first

01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,880
question is what about SAS provider

01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,319
software as a service providers for

01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,330
nonprofits that may not be able to

01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:54,170
afford a full-on deployment hosting

01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:55,609
configuration etc there are some out

01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:57,140
there I know there's one that's out in

01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:58,430
Europe and i want to say there is at

01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,100
least one or two of them up in north

01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:03,819
america so there is availability to do

01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,839
it basically on a subscription service

01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:07,580
generally the limitations are going to

01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:09,770
be either by the number of context

01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,210
you're trying to store or the amount of

01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,609
email you're trying to send out or

01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,799
something like that and again it's not a

01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:18,230
bad place to start you know you might

01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:19,970
find out that yeah you know for 500

01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:22,310
contacts or a thousand context you want

01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,049
to keep track of that is actually a very

01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,690
feasible solution that you don't have to

01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:28,670
necessarily deploy on your own and in

01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:30,230
some ways at square we have done that

01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:32,240
for a number of our clients where their

01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:34,609
actual front and website is completely

01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,490
separate and we just put a Drupal GUI

01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:40,940
wrapper around City CRM and then we host

01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:42,859
it on like a CRM dot example dot org for

01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:46,100
the clients to use as they're almost

01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:48,109
back an internal tool and then as they

01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:50,260
grow they might want to expose parts of

01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:53,020
it and so then we just basically

01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:56,030
integrate through a number of things

01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:58,100
number of methodologies to their main

01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:01,310
website so they can still reference

01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:03,080
their CRM website their org that's their

01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,900
CRM system but it doesn't impact

01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,440
necessarily their main website per se so

01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,610
there are some options we're truly its

01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,960
software as a service and then there is

01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:14,660
what i would call it's more of a hybrid

01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,310
we're like it's where we provide that to

01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,840
our clients we do the hosting we do the

01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,570
maintenance and everything so for them

01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,510
it's effectively a software-as-a-service

01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:24,470
but then they have the benefit of having

01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:26,240
knowledgeable developers and somebody

01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,710
that understands their process that can

01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,710
help them out over the long run

01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:50,960
yeah so the question is how does civvy

01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:54,710
serum compared with some of the other

01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:58,310
CRM systems that have been in

01:10:54,710 --> 01:11:02,390
development and or gaining traction with

01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:04,700
in core or other CRM systems okay number

01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:06,650
one I think cv crm is already you know

01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:10,100
again it's been around since 2004 so

01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:12,860
it's battle-tested it's got a large

01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,210
community around it etc every time I've

01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,610
looked at some of the other CRM

01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:19,070
solutions I would say they're a good

01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:22,430
start but they lack the maturity and the

01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:24,290
critical momentum which you'll find

01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:26,000
again if you're trying to if you're

01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:28,130
looking at City CRM and go wow there's

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,200
one feature i would love to use and that

01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,610
feature already exists in another CRM

01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,830
you might not need to implement the

01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:37,010
entire city CRM to get that one feature

01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:38,120
but the real question is we're where and

01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:40,130
how are you going to grow in the future

01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,290
because chances are just because you

01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:43,640
implemented that one feature in six

01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,140
months you might say oh I want to do

01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:48,290
something else or I want to you know

01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:49,910
expand on this is that system whatever

01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:51,410
the other system and they're good

01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:53,650
efforts there and I've talked to some of

01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:57,380
the people that are developing them and

01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:59,600
again it's I think it's it's about the

01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:01,580
CRM community and CRM way of thinking

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,280
about things that helps its kind of the

01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:07,820
you know rising tide lifts all boats so

01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:09,500
it helps everybody there is a couple

01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:12,080
other systems out there that I know I've

01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,450
talked to people and some are backed by

01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,400
commercial companies more than others so

01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:19,280
you have to kind of consider your

01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:21,350
philosophy and and scalability and

01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,320
sustainability long-term whether you

01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:26,450
want to go down a certain path where

01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,270
it's dependent basically on one drupal

01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:31,670
shop providing that but the other thing

01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:36,080
I would say is the distinction there

01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:40,160
being some of these efforts are more of

01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:42,470
a framework so they don't they don't

01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,390
have use cases they don't have you know

01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:46,610
so they take it as a framework and then

01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:48,800
they implemented it in a particular way

01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:50,630
where a civvie CRM really you can

01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,570
install you can get running out of the

01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,340
box in any

01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:55,800
one of these modules pretty quickly it's

01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:57,750
not I mean it's a framework but it's

01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,000
also kind of pre-configured for use

01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,410
you're not starting from ground zero

01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,330
whereas I know some of the other CRM

01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:07,830
efforts are very much at a point of

01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:12,030
we're the framework and you really have

01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:14,960
to build the house on top of it all

01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:17,850
right you're welcome any other questions

01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:21,170
all right thank you everybody enjoyed

01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:21,170
