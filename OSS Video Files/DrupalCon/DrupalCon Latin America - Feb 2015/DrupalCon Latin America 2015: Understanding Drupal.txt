Description: 
	Speakers: tucho
Drupal is an extremely flexible system. To achieve this, various layers of abstractions are built into it. Many concepts were create to explain these abstractions. Unfortunately, they are not always intuitive for someone just starting with drupal. For example, the ubiquitous word 'node' does not represent a point in a network nor a server side programming language.

Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

* How is content entered and administered?
* What is a node?
* What are entities?
* What is the difference between bundles and content types?
* What is a block and what can I do with it?
* How are users and permissions managed?
* What is a module and its purpose?
* What is a theme and how can it change the look and feel of my website?
* How can I create the navigation of my website?
* I'm not a fisherman. Why do I need hooks?
* Why a kitten passes away every time I make a quick fix in the downloaded code? How can I prevent that?

A new version of drupal is soon to be released. It will ship with lots of cool new features and, as you might imagine, it will bring new concepts and more questions for beginners. For example:

* What is the difference between content and configuration entities?
* What is the difference between state and configuration?

The drupal community don't want new adopters and prospect contributors go away for not understanding our parlance. Come to this session and figure out what is drupal. Don't worry, it won't be a theoretical, boring talk. It will be a joyful conversation with lots of examples to help you understand drupal and why it is so powerful.

See you there! :D

This session was inspired by Lullabot's documentary Understanding Drupal.

P.D.: The concepts that will be explained are not bound to a specific drupal version. When talking about drupal 8 specific features a note will be given.
