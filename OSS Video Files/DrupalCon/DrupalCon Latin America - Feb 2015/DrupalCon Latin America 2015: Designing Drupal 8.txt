Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Designing Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: LewisNyman
Drupal 8 includes some major changes to the administrative interface. This session explores the purpose and details behind many of the main UI overhauls in Drupal 8.

This session is presented by Lewis Nyman (maintainer of the Seven theme) and Bojhan Somers (UX maintainer).

The presentation covers:

The toolbar; building a responsive menu
The content creation page; overhauling Drupal's bland look
The style guide; improving the visual design of Seven
Much more; module page, inline editing, making Drupal responsive, integrating views into core.
Designing in the community is hard, we take a closer look at a few of these initiatives to show the process from exploration, proposal, to implementation that takes place in the community.

We're also going to look towards the future, to expand the Seven style guide beyond core to better serve the needs of contrib developers and create a more seemless experience for site builders.

Hello, thanks for coming. I don't think there will be any translations,

00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:12,009
but if there's any wording I use in English that is harder to understand, then just raise

00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,889
your hand and ask me. I don't mind stopping and trying to explain

00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:18,590
it in a simpler way. Also, my mother's here.

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,940
She speaks pretty good Spanish, so maybe you can ask her to translate any terms that I

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,790
don't get across very well. Anyway, my name is Lewis Nyman.

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,050
I'm a front-end developer and I'm a designer. I live in Switzerland, but I work for a company

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,940
in the UK, the UK office of Wunderkraut. I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm very happy to support the local community. I'm really glad that Wunderkraut were happy

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,820
to support me and pay for my flights to come here.

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Thanks a lot to them. I'm the maintainer of the Seven theme in Drupal,

00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,159
the admin theme that ships when you install Drupal.

00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,159
Last week, I became the maintainer for all the CSS in Drupal.

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,430
When I agreed and accepted the maintainer position and the commit was made, after that

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,500
I thought, "Maybe I should check and see what I'm getting myself into."

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:28,420
I had a look, and there are actually 145 CSS files in Drupal 8, and there are about 13,836 lines,

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,810
so quite a lot. Then I thought, "Maybe this wasn't such a

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,530
good idea to accept this maintainership role, I guess."

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,030
Then I ran all of Drupal 8 CSS through a code quality linting tool, and it has about 846

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,260
errors in it. Then I knew that it was a bad idea to accept this.

00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,190
I'm not going to talk about CSS really today.

00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:03,170
I'm talking about the way we design the experience of using Drupal and how we design that user experience.

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,240
Drupal is a very flexible and a very powerful tool,

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,670
but with that you have so much flexibility that you don't really have any expectations

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,689
about how someone will use it. You don't really have a lot of control over

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:22,359
how the end user will use Drupal. It becomes very difficult to design for it

00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,400
because there are some problems that you wouldn't get when you're designing a normal product

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,689
where it kind of stays the same and you kind of have the expectations of how people will use it.

00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,129
When I'm talking about experience design,

00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:40,109
I mean in particular the way people experience using the software.

00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,969
It's a very difficult thing to manage because it's not something that you can test.

00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,060
There's no graph that shows how good an experience is.

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,109
It's kind of built up of feelings, and you can't really measure feelings in that way,

00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,769
but you know when they're good and you know when they're bad.

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,829
Like when you taste something, you know if it's good or bad, but you can't measure it really on a scale.

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:08,650
It's not just enough to make Drupal possible

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,670
and understandable and usable. It has to be better than that because everything

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,650
that you do in your life, everything that you've done has been possible and understandable and usable.

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,069
For example, if you took a taxi through Bogota

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,269
this morning to get here, you know it was possible, you knew how to do it, but that

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,169
doesn't mean that you had a good experience or that you enjoyed doing it.

00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:35,639
At Wunderkraut we had these principles of how we design.

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,989
The first thing you do is you make it usable. The second thing you do is you make it useful.

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,319
After that, you make it desirable, and if you can, you make it delightful.

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,299
These are the kind of things that we struggle with doing in Drupal when we're designing it.

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,419
I'm going to talk about that a bit more.

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,939
When you have a bad user experience, it's very easy for a user to feel overwhelmed,

00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,579
like they're very frustrated. They feel very helpless.

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:10,889
They feel very unsure of their own abilities to use the tool they're trying to use.

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:16,489
It's very easy to feel intimidated by software. It's very easy to feel like you're not good

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,699
enough to use it or you don't have the right skills to use it.

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,800
Inconsistency is also a big problem because if you expect something to happen, but then

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,849
something completely different happens, you just lose confidence in yourself and you lose

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:36,830
confidence in the tool you're using, and you become very unsure about how to use it.

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,720
The problem is that every feature that we add to our products, we increase the complexity

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,720
and we increase the potential for inconsistency, which is a big problem with Drupal, 

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,960
which I'll come to. Why is Drupal's user experience important?

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,370
It's important for two reasons. The first one is about the clients, because

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,860
they are the ones who pay us money to work with Drupal.

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,860
It means we're able to be here, and it means we get to work with Drupal every day.

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,460
In the long run, if a client has a negative experience using Drupal, they build up a lot

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,520
of negative emotions, and they start feeling very bad about the tool they're using, and

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,729
they feel quite bad about Drupal. They feel quite bad about the people who

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:32,099
put them in the situation where they don't feel great about using the product that they use.

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,500
The thing is that people talk.

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,590
They talk to each other a lot. Clients talk to each other all the time,

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,629
and we know this because we know that Drupal has a reputation for being difficult to use or

00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:50,490
not very usable. The other reason is site builders.

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:57,490
At one point, we're all just site builders if we're developers and we're clicking around

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,539
using Drupal to build the sites we want to build before people learn to code.

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,720
Everyone starts out being a site builder at some point, so it's really important to build

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,819
a good experience for them as well. Sometimes you just want to be able to use

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,930
the tool and get it working and do what you want it to do.

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,020
You don't want to have to learn every part of the system, how everything works.

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,530
You just want to know enough to do what you want to do.

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,080
One of the problems that we have with Drupal is the amount that you need to know to know

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,080
enough kind of feels a bit like this. This is really tough for Drupal because there

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,770
are so many new alternatives nowadays. There are loads of projects out there that

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,669
are really good. Their experience is really good to use,

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,110
and that's all the user sees. They only see the stuff that's in front of

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,689
them and how they use it. They can't compare the code quality of Drupal or

00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:07,599
how flexible it is. They just know how easy it is to use.

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,219
These bad experiences of people using Drupal, they kind of reflect back on us as a community.

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,169
Drupal has a reputation of requiring special knowledge

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,400
or you have to know the right things in order to use it, which is a shame because,

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,030
instead of being exclusive, the Drupal community is very inclusive, very welcoming, very friendly,

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:32,030
and the software doesn't always reflect that at all.

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,919
I think it's kind of obvious, or at least I've convinced you that the UX of Drupal is

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,250
really important. If we improve the user experience of using

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:46,250
Drupal, it's going to make a big difference in the future for how Drupal is used.

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,860
Who is responsible for Drupal's user experience? Does anyone know?

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Does anyone have any ideas? Is it designers, core developers, module developers,

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,159
or site builders? Does anyone know?

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,479
Yeah. It's all of us.

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,400
It's a trick question, but not a very clever one.

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,909
The designers have a really important responsibility because they research and they find problems

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:27,539
with Drupal, and they can solve those problems, and they can define new conventions.

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,130
The core developers who work on Drupal core, they can implement this framework that's usable

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,990
and is extendable by other people. The module developers, they have to use and

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,920
extend their framework, and how they use and extend Drupal is really important because

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,070
there isn't a Drupal installation out there that doesn't have some extra modules installed.

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,440
They are part of the experience of using Drupal. They're not separate.

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,410
Once they're installed, they're part of the same experience.

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,010
Keeping them consistent and keeping them together is really important.

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,800
The site builders, they have the biggest responsibility because their job is to take all the different

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,550
Lego blocks and plug them together to make an experience that's usable by the client.

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,110
They have the final responsibility over everyone else.

00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:27,220
On top of that, the client also has the ability to feed back and to give their perspective

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,370
and to give their insights, so they can help improve Drupal as well.

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,769
There's good news. I'm not just trying to be really negative

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,200
about Drupal's user experience. It's making progress, and it's getting better.

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,970
One of the problems is that the expectations of what are good experiences are also improving as well.

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,920
As we're trying to fix our own problems,

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,899
we have to keep moving forward to keep up with the expectations of new users.

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,370
I wanted to go over just a quick, short history of the past few years and how Drupal's core

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,880
experience has improved. This is Drupal 6, I don't know, a long time

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,500
ago. I think I first started using Drupal in Drupal 6.

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,510
It didn't have a custom design for the admin interface.

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,970
It used the same theme that you'd have on

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,970
the front of the site, which wasn't geared towards configuring and creating content,

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,560
and it didn't have really any usability to it.

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,040
You had to go and install these modules, and you had to know the right modules that you

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,050
had to install in order to make it easy to use.

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,050
If you start using Drupal from the beginning, you don't even know what a module is.

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,269
You don't even know where to go to find one to install.

00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:48,269
There were loads of problems with Drupal 6. I think originally we did some usability testing,

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,920
and the results were terrible. Drupal was meant to be a CMS, but not one

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,730
user could find their content once they made it.

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,139
It became really obvious to the whole community that there were big problems with Drupal's

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:10,139
user experience in Drupal 6. In Drupal 7, it improved a lot.

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,079
We designed a custom admin theme. I say we.

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,800
I wasn't involved then. I only became involved during Drupal 8.

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,199
We designed a custom admin theme that was built for managing content and configuring

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:30,949
the site, so this was a big improvement by itself.

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:33,589
In Drupal 8, we've taken that and we've expanded on it.

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,529
We've evolved it even further. I want to come back to these improvements

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:43,089
in a little bit because I want to talk about Drupal's contrib experience as well.

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,910
That's an important part of the entire experience of using Drupal.

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,399
This is a screenshot of the module called Panels.

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,470
One of the things that we tend to do in Drupal is we display information in tables.

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,490
If there's any information at all, it gets displayed in a table up here like this.

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,370
You have lists of contexts, and even if they have just a label and some buttons, put it

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,970
in a table. That's pretty much what we do all over the

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,810
place in Drupal. All information is listed in a table even

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:21,040
if it's not the most appropriate way to display the information.

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,269
Something else we added in Drupal 7 is this component called vertical tabs where you can

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,940
split up information based on these tabs on the left-hand side, and everyone was really

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,180
excited about this idea. You know, we've got this new component.

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,550
We can use it to show the right information. We can make it easy to find.

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,050
But what Panels does is it kind of takes a vertical tab and then inside of it, it puts

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,690
more vertical tabs, and inside of that, it puts even more vertical tabs.

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,690
Then along the right-hand side over here, they have also horizontal tabs.

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,870
It's really hard to tell if you click on these what changes over here.

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,250
Is this relevant to that bit? You don't really know.

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,850
My point is that it's really easy to take these UI conventions that we have, user interface conventions,

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,250
and then just push them to the point where they don't work anymore.

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,000
You kind of push them to the point where they break.

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,380
This is another module called Contexts. In this one, the module developer decided

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,920
that in order to do what they wanted to do with the module, they had to develop their

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,139
own custom UI, so they built this user interface from scratch.

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,759
You can see it has vertical tabs a little bit, and then it has these buttons on the side,

00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:42,910
and it doesn't really work that well. It's very difficult if you need to have a

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,459
custom interface because the stuff that Drupal gives you isn't enough.

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,180
Then there's a lot of work to do, and there aren't that many designers in the community

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,740
to help you, so you kind of have to figure it out by yourself.

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,389
This is a module called Rules. Rules is a very complicated and it's a very

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,230
powerful module. You can do a lot with it.

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,440
There is really no design to it. It's just a big, long form, everything.

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,040
There isn't really any design done at all on it.

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,670
This is because the module developers don't have a lot of support from designers in the

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,259
community, so they kind of have to just leave it as it is.

00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,819
They can't really do a lot of work to improve the design and make it easier to understand

00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:33,439
or make it easier to use. Views is another really good example because

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,589
it's part of Drupal 8 now. It's part of Drupal core, but it still feels

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,310
completely different to the rest of Drupal because it has all of its own conventions

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,069
and it has its own ways of using it, which you have to learn to use Views.

00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:52,610
Then you never use those lessons that you've learned ever again in the rest of Drupal.

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,889
These are the kind of inconsistency problems that we have.

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:03,569
We have all these modules that have different designs, but we need to make the modules feel

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,560
like they're all Drupal. They need to feel like they're part of the

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,509
same experience. The biggest problem is that we have very few

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:18,290
designers contributing to Drupal. Only a handful, probably under 10, so we can't

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,529
get all these designers to go and sit with all the module developers and help them ensure

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,940
that the interface is well-designed and it's consistent.

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,730
We just don't have those numbers. I'm just going to go over some of the improvements

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:39,670
that we've made to the user experience in Drupal 8, which was in the past three years.

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,089
We completely redesigned the installation screen.

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:49,029
This is probably the first really big issue that I worked on in Drupal.

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not something that you see very often. It's not something that you'd use every day,

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,009
but it is the first thing that people see, so it's really important that we show them

00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,930
a good first impression, and it looks friendly and easy to use.

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:07,649
Because once they have that first expectation set, it kind of changes how they use Drupal

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:14,459
and what they expect from it. We also redesigned the toolbar in Drupal 8,

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,829
so it's completely rewritten from the one in Drupal 7.

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:24,829
You can get around a lot easier by collapsing the menu items.

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,209
It's also completely mobile-friendly, so it works just as well on tablet and mobile devices

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:36,319
as it does on desktop. It's really designed to work on everything.

00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,269
We also redesigned the module page. If you want to find a module now, you can

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:45,690
just type it in and it will show up and filter the rest of the modules.

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,310
In previous versions, you just had to scroll up and down and look for it unless you knew

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:56,360
the right modules to install to make it easier. I think overall in terms of man hours of developers,

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,019
the number of times that they have to do this, we're probably saving days and days of time

00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,660
of people scrolling up and down. That was a really good improvement to put

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,600
into Drupal 8. We also completely redesigned the content

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,069
creation page, so you can see a lot of the secondary information is moved over to the

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,059
right-hand side. This is information that isn't as important

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,980
as your content, so you have a straight line here of all the content that you need to place

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,689
in and the secondary information on the right-hand side.

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,460
You can kind of ignore it if you want to. It's not required.

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,539
This was a really good improvement because we found that if we had a long list of all

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,820
the content, then every user thought they had to fill it out, that it was important.

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
That is why we made the change to move it to the right-hand side.

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,860
We also have a WYSIWYG editor in core now, which is amazing.

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,090
It only took 10 years to put a WYSIWYG editor into Drupal, but look, you can make things

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,750
bold and italic now. It's amazing.

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:02,750
We also implemented some basic widgets to add links and another widget to add an image.

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,760
The basic configuration of the WYSIWYG out of the box when you install it is actually

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,220
pretty good. That's really good to have out of the box

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,380
because every client asks for these kind of things in every project, so it's great to

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,380
have this baseline of settings so you can just use it straight away out of the box.

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,179
We also added this new module called the quick edit module.

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,570
What it lets you do is it lets you modify your content in the page when you're looking

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,120
at it. You can change any of the text on this page

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,460
and you hit "save." It saved it already, so you don't have to

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,850
go to the back of the site to change your content, and you can see exactly how it's

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,230
going to look before you hit "save." This is obviously a really good improvement.

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,120
It's like magic. It's something that's tested really well,

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,120
and it's a really important feature to have. Something else that we've done is we've redesigned

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,620
the block placement page, so now you can add as many blocks of as many types as you want

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,120
to Drupal. We kind of had to rebuild the design of the

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,530
page so it supported adding as many as you want.

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,020
You don't just drag them around anymore. If you want to add more than one breadcrumb

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,400
block to a page, you can. That's a big functional improvement, but we

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,400
had to improve the design and change the design so it supported this new functionality.

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Kind of like the way that we design the modules, we also have the same problem inside Drupal

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,440
core because all the improvements that we make are separate.

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,690
They're made in completely separate issues, and they're made in separate modules as well.

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,130
It's all modular. What we don't have is this overview of how

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,770
these changes and these improvements actually affect the entire experience and how they

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,980
affect each other. This is maybe the biggest problem.

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:10,970
We're very good at making changes, but we're not too good at the overview.

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,289
After maybe three or four years of Drupal 8 development, this is a screenshot of the

00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:21,090
buttons we had in the Seven theme, and you can see that we have five different styles of

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,929
buttons, and none of them look any good. The problem was that all these buttons are

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:30,350
being added in separate issues, and no one was looking at them together and saying, you

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,500
know, these don't look right together. They don't match up.

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,500
It was even really basic stuff like this that we were struggling to get right.

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,730
This designer called Frank Chimero, he wrote this amazing book about design and what he

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,770
thinks design is, how he thinks it works, called "The Shape of Design."

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:59,770
He had this metaphor for how he used design, kind of like a painter.

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,070
When you're painting and you're making brushstrokes, you get very close to the canvas.

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,029
You know you're making the detailed brushstrokes, and you're making the right colors, and you're

00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:14,830
making the right choices. After you make those changes and you change

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,390
the canvas, you want to have a step back, and you want to see about how those brushstrokes

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,890
have affected the entire canvas, not just the small part you're looking at.

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,429
We're quite good at doing the tiny brushstrokes in Drupal, making those changes, but from

00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:34,659
a design point of view, we're not too good at the stepping back and looking at the entire canvas.

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,799
This is one of the big problems that we had

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:43,510
to solve during Drupal 8. This isn't something that you can fix with

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,070
issues or patches. You have to change how the community works

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,070
together and how they work. About two years ago, we started work on a

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:03,419
style guide for the Seven theme, which is the admin theme.

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,740
There were a few objectives behind the style guide.

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,210
One was to add consistency to core and contrib modules.

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,770
Like I said, it is really important that they're part of the same experience.

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:24,429
Another two for it to be accessible, because Drupal has a very high standard for accessibility,

00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:29,720
and it had to be mobile-friendly, which was a big thing because Drupal had no concept

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,210
of working on mobile devices or any other devices apart from a desktop computer.

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,970
That was a big change. We also kind of wanted to update the visuals

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,909
of Drupal because in the past few years, the mobile operating systems have kind of pushed

00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:50,610
forward expectations for how things look and how things work.

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:57,610
The expectations were much higher, so we wanted to update Drupal so it felt more modern.

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,740
Drupal already has some brand principles about how it should feel and how it should be,

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,409
which we developed during the Drupal 7 cycle when we first designed the admin theme.

00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,090
What we did when we designed the style guide is we took those principles and we reinterpreted

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:22,090
them so we could base the visuals of the style guide on these principles.

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,309
The first one is that Drupal must be clear and direct and concise.

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:35,730
Some of the way we display information now is we have strong colors and very crisp lines

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:42,730
in certain places to emphasize the right information. We also use just the right amount of spacing

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,880
between everything, so it's really clear the separation between different information.

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,520
The other principle is that Drupal must be calming.

00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,720
It's not always calming, but it should try and be calming.

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,110
What we have is a lot of rounded corners. You see in the buttons here and on the edges

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:11,110
of the modal windows, everything is kind of rounded to make it feel less sharp and less dangerous.

00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,460
Another principle is that Drupal should feel

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,820
kind of natural. It should kind of feel like it's built by

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,070
people, not built by machines. You can see in the choices that we've made

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:25,710
for the type faces, they all have quite soft and rounded corners, and they're not very

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,770
straight and exact. Also in the icon set that we designed to use

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,649
for Drupal 8, there are no sharp edges. They're all rounded corners.

00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:40,700
It doesn't look like it's been cut by a machine. It looks like it's been made more by a person.

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,270
It feels more natural. Another thing is that Drupal should try and

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,230
feel friendly, so we found different points where we could add bits of bright color just

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,970
here and there, just a little bit. It's not too overwhelming, but it just gives

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,970
it a little bit more... It kind of feels a little bit more happy.

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,789
When you put it all together, you can kind of see that it looks slightly different to

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,919
how it did before, but it's not completely different.

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,529
It's not a brand new theme. It's just kind of an evolution, so it's a

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:23,529
slightly evolved design, but not a completely new design.

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,669
That's kind of where we're at. We redesigned the Seven theme, and we produced

00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:34,340
the style guide, and then we implemented these new designs and visuals in Drupal, but that

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,230
doesn't solve every problem. Moving forward beyond that, we had to think

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,350
about ways that we could use the style guide to solve these problems and to improve the overall

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,250
experience and not just make it look a bit nicer.

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,679
The next thing we tried to do is go out and try and standardize the contributed modules,

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,149
the way people are doing things differently in all the different modules that you can install.

00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:02,299
We went out and we talked to maintainers of modules,

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:07,380
and we tried to find the UI components that they've made themselves because they need it.

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,570
We're trying to bring those things into the

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,659
Seven theme, so then everyone can use the same components together, and they don't have to

00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:19,320
write them themselves. One example is this.

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,760
We have this tool tip that appears when you hover over the "favorite" button in Drupal,

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,020
and what we're doing is we're making this reusable, so anyone can use this tool tip

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:38,020
anywhere, in any element they want, not just have it in this situation.

00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:46,700
Another example is this spinner that appears in the middle of Views pages, which doesn't

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,929
appear anywhere else in Drupal. It's just a Views thing.

00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:56,929
It's the only one that does it, and it just overrides the normal spinner, just in this

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,020
situation, which is weird. Views needed it that way, so what we did is

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,669
we created an issue, so now when you have a spinner, you can choose that you want a

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,820
full screen option. It means that any module or any page can use

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,880
this if they need to, and it's not just a Views thing that Views does on its own.

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,630
It becomes part of the tool set that module developers can use to make their pages easier to use.

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:27,890
Another example that we added to the Seven theme

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,740
is these layout classes. What you can do if you're a developer is you

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,019
can add these classes to the output of your module.

00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,230
If you want to be able to lay things out on the page, if you want to have half a column here,

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:49,100
a column there, or a third and two-thirds, you can do that without having to write any

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,360
of your own CSS. You can just add these classes, and then we

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,210
take care of the rest in the theme. It keeps it more consistent, and it makes

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,590
it easier for module developers. They don't have to figure out these problems

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:07,590
for themselves. Another example: We added helper classes and

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,510
styles to make it easier to emphasize information on the pages.

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:21,510
If you want to make some text on your module page bigger, like a heading, you can use these

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:29,130
heading-b classes, heading-c, heading-d to make it look like a header without actually

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:35,289
using the header tags because you should only use them in the right places for accessibility,

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:40,470
or you just write your own CSS to make it bigger, which makes it inconsistent with all

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,269
the other modules. This is a really useful tool set for being

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:50,659
able to make important information bigger without having to do the work yourself.

00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:56,730
Another quick example is these color classes. You can now add these classes in your mockup

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,760
if you want to show that something good has happened or something bad has happened,

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,220
You don't have to go and add those colors yourself.

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,860
You can just use them straight from the Seven theme, and then you know the colors are the

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,620
same across the whole of Drupal because you're just using these classes again.

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:18,440
Beyond that, we want to develop guidelines for how to use the style guide.

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,059
This is probably the most important part that we're working on because this is what we use

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:29,000
to tell developers how to use the different parts of the style guide or when to use them,

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,490
when to use the right components in this situation or when to use them in this situation.

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,860
Some examples of some interface guidelines that exist already.

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,039
The one that was released for iOS 7 by Apple was really good.

00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,220
It has a lot of emphasis on transitions and animations because that's important in iOS 7,

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,409
but it also has the guidelines about how to use them and when to use them.

00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:58,429
It also has a catalog of all the different components that you can use.

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:04,370
In this example here, it tells you what it is, and it shows you what it looks like, and then

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:11,370
it tells you when you should use it. Then it has a link directly to the documentation

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,390
of how you would implement it in code. It makes it really easy for developers to

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,669
find out what they should use and when they should use it.

00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:23,590
Then they can just click on the link to find out how to use it.

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,980
This is the branding guidelines for Ubuntu, and these ones are really good because they

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,480
have a listing of all the different components and the patterns that you can use.

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,179
What they also do is they give you special advice if you're aiming at a commercial customer

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,830
of if you're aiming at a member of the community or if you're aiming at the designer/developer

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:50,740
or if you're aiming it at someone who creates content.

00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,370
Drupal actually has its own user interface guidelines.

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,980
Hands up if you've ever heard of it. No.

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,529
No one's ever used it? Yeah, so this is usually a big problem.

00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,529
I think every time I've given this presentation, one person has put their hand up.

00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:12,570
I've given it quite a few times. There's clearly a problem here about how we

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,769
write the standards and the guidelines or how we promote it, how we make it available

00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:23,000
to the developers. What I've done is I've taken some inspiration

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
from Twitter Bootstrap, which is a user interface framework for developers.

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,429
It makes it very easy for them to add their own or to create their own UI without writing

00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,320
any code. I'm not saying that you should use it or it's

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,840
the best thing to use, but there are loads of things you can learn from it because it's

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,919
really popular. The reason why it's so popular is because

00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,760
it makes it so easy to use. It becomes really easy to know how to use

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,639
all the different components that are in the framework.

00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:59,510
We looked at this a lot for some inspiration. We came up with a plan for the Seven theme,

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,929
which is basically to take all the styling and split them up into their separate components.

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,309
We've done that now. Then the second step of the plan was to document

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:16,309
all of these files and all these components using a tool or a language called

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,760
KSS. That stands for Knyle Style Sheets.

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,190
All you do is you put comments in the styling files, and you describe the different components

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,070
that are contained within those files, and you give advice about how they should be used.

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:40,070
This tool reads these comments, and it creates a style guide out of it.

00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:44,960
This is a basic example of how it can look. This is kind of a proof of concept for what

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,960
we can do, but we still need to put all the comments into Drupal and into the style sheets.

00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,889
That's pretty much all the work that we've got up to so far in Drupal 8.

00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:05,889
At the beginning, I asked the question, "Who is responsible for the usability of Drupal?"

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,799
I said that it's up to the designers who are involved in Drupal and the developers to build

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,139
a framework that makes it easy to use and extend.

00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:23,380
I also said that it's up to the module developers, and it's up to the site builders to take those

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,760
tools and to build the final projects around it,

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,620
because they have those ones built at the end for the final product.

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,870
In the end, it's up to everyone else. That's all the work we've done so far, but

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,139
the rest of it is kind of up to everyone else. Thank you.

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:58,580
I think we have about 15 minutes, so does anyone have any questions?

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Yes. -It may be premature, but the question was raised in the keynote.

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:16,500
Someone said that they, in their shop in Drupal 7, they're using Bootstrap, and they're accustomed to using Bootstrap.

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:29,860
In Drupal 8, would there be a way where you have to make your own theme or do you have to wait for Bootstrap to be updated? Or can you just use it directly?

00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
[inaudible] using a certain theme.

00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:37,300
-If you want to use Bootstrap in Drupal, do you mean like for the front or for the back?

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,420
From the admin interface or for the front

00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,100
of the site? -Let's just take the regular site.

00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,830
-Sure, okay. There is a theme that implements Twitter Bootstrap

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,910
for Drupal 7, and if you want to use that theme for Drupal 8 you have to wait for it

00:34:53,910 --> 00:35:03,170
to be upgraded, which will take a while because the theme system in Drupal 8 is still unstable.

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,790
My recommendation would be to just use Bootstrap and make your own theme to implement the classes

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,300
here and there, and don't rely on the base theme or don't rely on Drupal too much.

00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:21,600
-Make a theme from scratch and then just put it in Bootstrap.

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:27,170
-Yeah, add the classes where you want to. If you want to that now, that's what I recommend.

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,480
-Do you see any pitfalls or any difficulty in doing that, out of the ordinary?

00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,790
-At the moment, yes, loads. There are loads of pitfalls because there

00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:43,130
are still loads of changes to the mockup in Drupal and to the styling in Drupal, so my

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,320
advice is to copy all the templates that create the mockup into your theme, and remove all

00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,230
the styling from Drupal 8 and just use Bootstrap when you use your own, because all that stuff

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,150
will change. If you upgrade, you will break stuff because

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,910
those files will change. If you don't rely on them at all, then you'll

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,330
be safer. I forgot to repeat what the question was for

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,020
the recording. It was, "Can I use Bootstrap now in Drupal

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:17,500
-[inaudible] The question was really in Spanish. It was a translation.

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:30,740
He was saying, "How can I integrate Bootstrap into Drupal 8?"

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,520
-Right. -That was his question, because he didn't

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,790
want to change his shop. -Oh, he didn't want to do extra work.

00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,570
-[inaudible] -Okay, I guess the guy who asked the question

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:47,980
isn't here, is he? -The guy has a shop where they all use Bootstrap,

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:55,470
so you're using Drupal 8, you have to abandon Bootstrap. -Sure. Okay, thanks.

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:02,030
Any other questions?

00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:31,150
-[inaudible]

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:39,030
What I've been thinking about is [inaudible]

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:16,060
-Yes. -In those cases, do you see Drupal 8 having a better possibility [inaudible]

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,500
-Yeah, wow, okay. That's a big question. The question was: Drupal 8 is more decoupled

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,880
now, and you are able to use services to just use the content from Drupal and put it wherever

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,080
you want, but there are certain problems with that still.

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,380
I don't know if I'm the best person to ask that, but I remember that there was an issue

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,190
to improve how messaging works. I think I'd like to add an event in JavaScript

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:50,030
where you can say, "Messages should appear in this area" in JavaScript, but I don't know

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,990
if that helps your situation in particular. Maybe we can talk about it afterwards a little

00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,820
bit more in detail, and then I can have a bit more of a think.

00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,820
Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. -[inaudible]

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,880
-Oh yeah, completely. I can help you write an issue to put into

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,060
the issue queues and you can suggest that and other people can look at it.

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,100
There is one. Okay, brilliant.

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,660
-It would be a big one.

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,100
-Yeah, it would be a big issue. You're right. Does anyone else have any questions?

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,100
Yes? -[inaudible]

00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,370
-Why was the dashboard module removed? There were a few modules that were removed

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,960
in Drupal 8, and those were the ones that had very specific functionality.

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,310
They did very certain things that you could recreate using modules that are more like

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:02,020
tools. In a project that I've worked in recently,

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,180
we had some more custom requirements for the dashboard, so we didn't use the Dashboard module.

00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,860
We used Panels to build custom dashboards for everyone.

00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,110
The Dashboard module wouldn't let you do that.

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,720
Some of the decisions are basically based on if there's a module that you can download

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,090
that will do this better, then we should remove the module that does it in a very simple way in core.

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:28,010
I'm trying to think of a few other examples

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,660
of modules that were removed, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,300
That's the logic behind it, really. Try and make less modules, but with the modules

00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:44,300
that you have, you can do more with them. Does anyone else have any questions?

00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:01,050
Do you want to translate? -[Spanish]

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:36,960
-His question is: What is a way for for a [inaudible] designer to get involved in all this work for Drupal and contribute? -Great

00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,220
[inaudible]

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,580
-Brilliant question.

00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:47,420
The question is if you're a designer and you want to get involved and contribute to Drupal,

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:54,310
how do you do that? I should have really said that at some point already.

00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,640
There are many IRC rooms that people use to

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,950
communicate in Drupal. There's Drupal/contribute, but there's also

00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,600
Drupal/usability. That's where the designers tend to discuss

00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,630
and talk and you can talk to the other designers who are already involved in Drupal.

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:19,630
Also there's a group on groups.drupal.org called usability, where we post updates on

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,200
usability changes in Drupal and how you can get involved.

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,130
That's another way to do it. One of the best ways to do it, I think, is

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:33,250
to come to a sprint at an event, either a DrupalCon or a smaller event where there are

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,200
mentors who are available to help. There's a lot of variety of the kind of sprints

00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,120
you can do. You don't have to know coding.

00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,720
If you even know just CSS and nothing else, there are still loads of things you can do.

00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,830
It's all about finding the right people to talk to at the sprints, and there are a lot

00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,120
of people there who can help you match up with the right people and find people who

00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:59,980
can help you get involved and help you get started.

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:09,880
They'll be recording, I guess, so we can translate it later, if that helps.

00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:19,920
[inaudible]

00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:27,650
-[inaudible] -And the sprints as well.

00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:39,760
-[inaudible]

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
Thanks a lot, yeah.

00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:51,640
This Thursday, tomorrow, there's going to be a sprint all day.

00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,900
I'm not sure where it is, if it's in this building or another building, but there will

00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,510
be loads of people there who can help out and help people who are new get started.

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,440
Any other questions? Okay.

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Thank you very much. If you want to know a little bit more, 

00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,090
you can ask me questions on Twitter. There are tags for the style guide issues

00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,480
and front-end issues. The website of the book by Frank Chimero that

00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,420
I mentioned is shapeofdesignbook.com, and you can go to the website, and you can download

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,860
it for free, and you can read it online. It's a brilliant book.

00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,260
If you like the pictures of the dogs that I had in the presentation, the website is

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,360
mensweardog.tumblr.com. That's usually the question I get asked more

00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,550
than anything else. Maybe next time my Spanish will be better.

00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,320
