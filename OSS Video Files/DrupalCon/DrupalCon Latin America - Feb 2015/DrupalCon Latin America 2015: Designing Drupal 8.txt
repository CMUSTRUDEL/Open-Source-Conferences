Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: LewisNyman
Drupal 8 includes some major changes to the administrative interface. This session explores the purpose and details behind many of the main UI overhauls in Drupal 8.

This session is presented by Lewis Nyman (maintainer of the Seven theme) and Bojhan Somers (UX maintainer).

The presentation covers:

The toolbar; building a responsive menu
The content creation page; overhauling Drupal's bland look
The style guide; improving the visual design of Seven
Much more; module page, inline editing, making Drupal responsive, integrating views into core.
Designing in the community is hard, we take a closer look at a few of these initiatives to show the process from exploration, proposal, to implementation that takes place in the community.

We're also going to look towards the future, to expand the Seven style guide beyond core to better serve the needs of contrib developers and create a more seemless experience for site builders.
