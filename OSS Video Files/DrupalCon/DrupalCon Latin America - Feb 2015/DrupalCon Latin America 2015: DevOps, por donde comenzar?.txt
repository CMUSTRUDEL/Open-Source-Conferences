The principles of Devops culture are based in the Lean thinking, the art of identify and know how to find waste, so now a days, in order to delivery high quality software Devops is a must, and needs to grow into your organization increasing performance. And thanks to Gene Kim study ( video ), that’s a fact.

Not just thinking about software here, we need to consider the human brains making that are doing the same thing, again, and this time, … hopefully right.
We need disciplines and tools to automate processes like testing, deploying and why not, providing your entire local and remote infrastructure, to ensure quality.

But!, finding the right ones to start with, can hinder your journey to implement them. Because they aren’t for all the cases, like, for example, maybe Jenkins (can be some other CI or CD tool) isn't fit for your organization's yet, … or not, you’ll see.

So if you are getting started in this Devops world, don’t worry about the many big tools, focus in the culture, and I’ll be showing you how to install and use some easy tools to start get out going right away, like we did.

Some of those tools are:

Services with deploy workflows, like Pantheon, BeanstalkApp, etc..
Hipchat, Slack or/and IRC clients.
Ubuntu Juju, using the Drupal charm. ( see this )
Vagrant and Ansible.
Linux containers.
Also I’ll talk about my vision of a future, where having a top notch environment with great performance for a Drupal project, is not only achieved through specialized hosting services. We can just share, and contribute, using all our knowledge and make open source tools that help us deliver easy and fast reliable working software to our clients.
