Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Migrating into Drupal 8
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Ryan Wealitaliatina
The migrate module is now part of core! This means that migrate is no longer a secondary option when upgrading your sites to Drupal 8, but is in fact the preferred route for upgrading. The previous in-place “upgrade” path has been removed from the system.

Find out what this means for your team and learn how to migrate Drupal 6 (and Drupal 7) sites directly into Drupal 8 using Drush. Learn what the plans are for the user interface. Know what differences to expect from the old version of migrate. Get up-to-date on the migration initiative progress at recent DrupalCon sprints in Austin and Amsterdam.

At the end of this session you will have the tools you need to help test the migration system and begin using your own data in Drupal 8.
