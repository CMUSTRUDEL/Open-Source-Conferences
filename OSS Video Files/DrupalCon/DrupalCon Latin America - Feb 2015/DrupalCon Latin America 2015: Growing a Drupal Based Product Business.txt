	Speakers: rszrama
Building a complex Drupal website is hard, but growing a Drupal based product business is even harder. It's not because we don't have good tools to prototype, build, and even sell Software-as-a-Service. Drupal allows us to do all that and more! However, the bigger challenge can be actually deciding what to build and then keeping it simple enough to succeed.

Commerce Guys is now over five years old, and we've learned some good and some hard lessons along the way. In this session, I'll share those lessons along with some of the product development principles behind the lean startup movement and the sales principles described in Predictable Revenue that will help your next business succeed.

We'd all love to "make money in our sleep," but the first step is actually building something people will want to use while we do.
