Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Creating a Culture of Empowerment
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Todd Nienkerk
En esta charla, Todd Nienkerk platicará acerca de los principos que ha seguido en la creación de Four Kitchens y como tú puedes seguir los mismos principios para crear tu propia compañía.

Drawing on more than thirteen years of leadership at Four Kitchens and other creative organizations, Todd Nienkerk will discuss why empowerment is the foundation of all successful teams.

What is empowerment? Why does it matter? How can an organization create a culture of empowerment?

The guiding principles of empowerment:

Build a company you would want to work for
Give people control over their destiny
Make trust the center of your culture
How to cultivate empowerment:

Personal brands. You shouldn't be afraid that people will leave. If you’re afraid people will become "too good," then you’re not offering something they want — and you know it.
Go virtual. Allow your team the flexibility to work from home — or anywhere in the world.
Adopt agile methodologies. Allow teams to self-organize around projects and problems.
And much, much more...
This session will build off a similar one from Twin Cities DrupalCamp 2014. Slides and a detailed outline are available.

Good afternoon everyone. Buenas tardes.

00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,889
Welcome to, "Creating a Culture of Empowerment" My name is Todd Nienkirk. I'm a 

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,769
digital strategist and partner at Four Kitchens. If you have any

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,590
follow up questions or if you want to touch base after this session,

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,480
that's my email address. I'm on Twitter @toddross.

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,750
I warn you in advance though it's mostly

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,099
bad puns. I don't know how puns work in Spanish but just trust me they're brilliant

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,969
English puns. Before we get started I want to say a few words about the nature of

00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:38,100
this presentation because this is unusual for a DrupalCon talk.

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,530
We're not gonna talk about Drupal. We're not going to talk about the web.

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,870
We're not gonna talk about technology or even process.

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,030
Instead, we're going to talk about how we apply

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,050
and open source philosophy to management, to teams,

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,329
and to people. So you're also going to hear me talk a lot about the way we do

00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,449
things at Four Kitchens,

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,530
I want to assure you that this is not intended to be bragging.

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,140
The presentation I'm about to give you is the result

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,590
of nine years a trial and error and many many many failures.

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
We don't have all the answers. We're also trying to find them,

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,990
but I think we're on to a few things and I want to share them with you.

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,580
Also, I want to be attuned to

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,830
the different customs and cultures in the room as well so

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,750
a lot of the opinions and a lot of the experiences I will discuss

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,530
are based on things we've done in the United States.

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,630
I recognize that the culture of work

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,840
varies from country to country sometimes even

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,100
from city to city so I do acknowledge that

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,670
not everything I say will apply to everybody in this room but I hope that

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,200
everybody can take something away from this.

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,250
Why am I here today?

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,799
I am here to help people run better companies

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,719
by making teams and leaders happier. So how many of you

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,040
are business owners were leaders within your organization in some way?

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,700
Excellent. That's about right.

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,800
I want to tell you story that was the

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,970
inspiration for this whole talk. This is the "Two Snacks a Day"

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,190
story. In 2000, I worked at a startup

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,060
just before I started college and this startup

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,700
was like any other started during the dot-com bubble

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,280
back in 2000. They had a lot of money

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,870
and they had no idea what to do with it so they thought that the best way to

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,120
spend their money was on

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,660
benefits for their employees. They did all kinds of unusual things.

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,540
One of the many many many things that they did

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,500
that cost a lot of money was they had a lot of snacks

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,250
and drinks and things for everybody to eat and

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,970
you know be comfortable throughout the day. A lot of companies do this.

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,120
But at some point during

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,580
the six months or so that I worked there somebody send an email

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,260
and the email said everybody can only have two snacks per day.

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,180
We used to have unlimited snacks and Cokes and

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,480
whatever it is we wanted to drink I but now suddenly we were limited to two snacks.

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,980
What do you think that did to the team?

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,350
Everybody started wondering, "Are we going out of business?

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,500
Why can't the afford for me three snacks a day

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,209
or for snacks a day? How much does a snack

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,160
cost? Is it fifty cents? Is a dollar?

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,639
How many people work at this company? 40 ... okay.

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,920
If forty people are spending an extra

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,700
snack a day, an extra dollar day, that's forty dollars a day,

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,359
that's two hundred dollars a week, that's eight hundred dollars a month. Are we going to go out

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,460
of business because of all the snacks we eat? Is eight hundred dollars a month

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,130
really going to help company survive if they have to cut back

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,510
by that much? Who's in charge of policing

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,650
the snacks that we eat? Is my co-worker going to tell on me

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,590
when I eat three sacks? Do I get to carry over snacks?

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,000
If I eat only one on a Monday, can I eat three on a Tuesday?

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,989
Is that okay?"

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,859
This stops making sense pretty quickly right?

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,110
It changed the entire culture. People thought we were going out of business,

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,590
people started telling other people because "Todd" had too many snacks

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,080
yesterday. It cost 50 cents

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,190
for a snack, right?  That's an example of

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,440
a bad culture. That was a big mistake that was made

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,070
that organization and towards the end my time there

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:48,360
they were bought, and they eventually went out of business. So let's start by defining culture.

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,960
What do I mean by culture? Culture is defined

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,030
as the behaviors and believes characteristic

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,510
of a social, ethnic, or age group. Your company

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,410
where you work is a social group. You spend about a third of your life there.

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,460
That's about as much time as you spend with your family.

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,880
The culture also effects how you think and feel about a group.

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
when you think about a culture,

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,920
you have some positive feelings and some negative feelings.

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,560
I want to run an experiment right now, and I've

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,520
never done this before so bear with me. The experiment is:

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,660
what is the culture of the United States?

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,420
Just think about that for a moment.

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,960
I'm going to show you some images

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,280
and I want you to think about what culture means

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,280
and how these images make you feel.

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,289
How did those images make you feel?

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,729
Like America? American? What else? You will not offend me, I promise you.

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,199
I put some kinda disturbing images in there.

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,229
I kept it pretty light but what are some other thoughts?

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,099
What do you think of when you think of the culture of the United States?

00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,529
What?

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,629
Very familiar. Where you from? You're from Colombia.

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:17,629
Anything else?

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,040
... focused on ego ... egocentric

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,440
The class struggles is very much a part of the culture. One last one.

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Yes sir?

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Dichotomy?

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,930
A dissonance between the image that's portrayed what's actually happening in society.

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,199
These are the feelings that we have around the culture

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,919
of the United States. But this culture has many layers.

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,779
We focused on national culture but there are many different layers to what we define of as culture.

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,770
There's human culture, for example. Psychologists know

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,969
that we have certain universal motions,

00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,150
facial expressions, ways that we express ourselves, body language.

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,990
So of it is divided into nations or other small groups

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,620
but for the most part a smile means you're happy and a frown means you're sad.

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,180
Psychologists have tested this all over the world

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,069
even among some tribes that have barely been contacted.

00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:40,540
There's some universal human truths within a universal human culture.

00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,020
We also have a culture around our language.

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,940
They're many countries that speak Spanish, many countries that speak English.

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,060
It spans multiple nations.

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,740
Neurologists have found that there's an assumption we have

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
about how language works in the brain that is wrong.

00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,390
Common sense says

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,399
that our language

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,439
exists to express our thoughts.

00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:09,059
We have thoughts, language provieds them with structure 

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,880
and that's how we communicate them to one another.

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,709
It turns out that's actually not true, it's the opposite.

00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,640
If you don't have language, you do not have thought

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,510
they have found people who were raised in

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,250
terrible situations where they did not have exposure to language

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,600
and it turns out that they did not really possess thought as we know it.

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,180
Language physically shapes

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,589
and alters our brain. So it stands to reason

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,740
that the way your language works changes your brain. The grammar

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,950
structure Spanish creates a different brain

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,370
than the grammar and language and structure of

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,430
English or German or Chinese or Japanese.

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,700
That's a kind of culture that spans

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,050
borders. Obviously, there's national culture.

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,270
When we say culture, this is usually what we mean. We talk about nations.

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,339
We also have local culture.

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,660
Bogota is different than Medellin. New York City

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,680
is different than Los Angeles. They're very different places.

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Some cities walk fast, and there's a lot of stress, or there's good public transit or there's not.

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,190
You look at a city like Los Angeles, you have to drive to get anywhere.

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,050
And then there is the culture of the self.

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,940
We are all individual, we all have different ancestry and family influences

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,610
we as individuals behave like. So we each have our own

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,670
individual culture. So here we are

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,970
the levels of culture. This is what I'm talking about

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,730
when I say culture I mean all these things.

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,780
The second part of this is empowerment.

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,700
First, I mean the autonomy to decide what you will do and ho you will do it.

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,960
Second, the freedom to challenge without fear of reprisal.

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,170
Sharing your thoughts and feelings, not being afraid to

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,350
say something that somebody disagrees with, speaking your mind.

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,510
The power to affect change.

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:31,529
The ability to actually do something to make something different.

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:36,193
Finally (excuse me) ownership of outcomes.

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,930
You cannot be empowered unless you are responsible

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,510
for what happens. If you're not responsible for what happens,

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,290
how can you actually be empowered to do anything?

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,180
Empowerment comes from autonomy, freedom, power

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,030
and ownership and ultimately it means controlling your destiny,

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,700
what you're going to do professionally and personally.

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,640
Why does it matter? Why is it important?

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,980
Empowerment makes teams happy

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
Teams that are empowered are more productive,

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,900
they enjoy their work more, quality of work goes up,

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,900
they pay more attention to details, people want to stick around,

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,150
you have higher retention, just a better place to work.

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,800
Empowerment will make your clients happy.

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,540
The positive feelings of your team

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,880
and the quality of work that they deliver will feed into the work that they do for your clients

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,120
They're happy, they do better work, they deliver better results to the clients,

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,740
and the client's pick up on this energy.

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,280
They pick up on whether people are happy or sad in

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,930
your organization, how people respond, the tone in her voice

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,210
the word choice they use in email.

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,000
Additionally, if your team is empowered, everybody has the ability

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,860
to do what it takes to solve the client's problems, so

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,320
everybody can do something for the client. Finally, empowerment enables leadership.

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,200
so for the leaders in the room, the company owners, or the managers or supervisors,

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,310
this means less work for you

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,250
so that you can focus on bigger problems,

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,160
long-term issues, planning for the future. If they're

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,250
fewer things that you have to decide micromanage, you can

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:38,250
redirect all that attention to bigger problems or more interesting things.

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,600
In a moment, I'm going to talk about very specific

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,220
tactical things that we've done to empower our team

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,750
but first I want to talk about the underlying principles

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,779
that guided those decisions.

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,040
The guiding principles of empowerment. 

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,300
Build a company you want to work for,

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,220
not a company you want to control.

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,300
For the business owners in the room,

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,960
why did you start a business?

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,400
Why did you start your business?

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,050
Anybody? Change the world?

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:24,220
Somebody made the money sign so that's fair. Let's acknowledge that.

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,220
To do what you want.

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,750
To work the way you want.

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,250
To be empowered. To do what you want and do it the way you want to do it.

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,140
Be responsible for the outcomes.

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,460
Whether you succeed changing world, making money,

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,520
whatever, you did it because you want to be empowered.

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,060
So make that company that you want to work for.

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,320
You have to empower other people.

00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,700
Give people control over their destiny.

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,570
Treat your coworkers as responsible professionals.

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,830
They are adults, they know what they're doing.

00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,590
They can collaborate with you.

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,050
They're not children that you should manage. This leads to mutual respect

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,500
In the knowledge industry, in what we do,

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,360
design, technology, development, people are very self-motivated.

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,160
they had to teach themselves how to do this there are very few schools that teach what we do.

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,140
These are generally people who want the freedom of freelancing,

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,680
of being contractors and they often

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,870
only get a job when they feel like they can't make it

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,790
as a freelancer but they still want that freedom.

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,910
They want to do what they want, how they want to do it.

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,140
And most importantly, let them succeed or fail. You have to let people fail.

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,630
it's the best way to learn and it's authentic.

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:02,700
Finally, make trust the center of your culture. Trust facilitates empowerment so you can't

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,040
actually empower someone until you trust them and they won't

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,870
act on that empowerment, they won't believe you, until they trust you

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,140
to let them succeed or fail.

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,660
This means you, as the manager or business owner have to be the first

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,550
to volunteer your mistakes. You have to be vulnerable

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,900
you have to explain that you made a mistake,

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,060
explain why, explain how you're going to fix it

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,140
and expect that from everybody else.

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,120
For the rest the presentation I want to talk about very specific things that we've done

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,490
in order to try and achieve this. Now these are just a few,

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,630
there are many other things that can be done.

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,020
I also want to turn this into a conversation.

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to leave plenty of time at the end for comments, questions, arguments, whatever.

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,640
I've already talked about how important language is

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,840
because language shapes the brain. It physically alters your brain.

00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:13,120
The words you use are very important. It's a bit of a corporate cliche

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,150
to say, "there is no "I" in team" but it's a cliche

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,890
and we all laugh at it because most people who say it don't mean it. But it's still true.

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,780
If you mean it authentically, it's very powerful.

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,780
Language is thought. It doesn't express thought, it is thought. 

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,200
When you say "we" instead of "I",

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,880
you're demonstrating how you actually think not just the words that you're saying.

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,160
We are a team. I don't like the "e" word, employees.

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
I don't like that word.

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,620
It immediately creates a structure.

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Don't ever say "my employees". You don't own them.

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,340
They aren't yours. They're there because they want to be there

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,420
and if you keep treating them like that they won't.

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,840
"We" not "I". "Team" not "employees".

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,480
Ask for input everyday in big ways, in small ways.

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,060
People want to be heard more then they want to be agreed with.

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:32,020
I'll say that one more time because it's really important. People want to be heard

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,020
more then they want to be agreed with.

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,260
It doesn't matter if you agree with them.

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,880
What matters is that you heard their problems,

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,020
you listen to them and you thought about them.

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,900
A lot of people also have an open-door policy.

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,680
That's great! You should have that, but having an open door

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,230
is very different from inviting somebody into the room. You have to actively

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,250
get people, bring them into the room and talk to them.

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,800
You have to set aside time, well in advance,

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,850
with an agenda to say this is what we're going to talk about

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,420
I want honest feedback about this,

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,680
so they have time to think about it and they're not put on the spot.

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,150
Ask the right questions.

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,770
Don't ask, "how are things going?"

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,630
What does everybody say? Their fine.

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,610
"How are you?"

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,800
"I'm fine."

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,020
"What did you do today?"

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
"Not much."

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,880
Ask specific questions that elicit imprtant answers.

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,020
"What's the most proud you have been this last month?"

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,080
"If you could change one thing about this company right now, what would it be?"

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,760
"What's the most difficult challenge you've overcome this year?"

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,200
Suddenly those answers go from, "Everything's fine" to "Oh, well there's all these things.

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,070
Now that I'm thinking about it, now that you've activated that part of my brain, 

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,910
I have all kinda stuff to say."

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,240
When I was creating this presentation, I took a poll of our team to ask, "Are we actually doing these things?"

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,150
"What are some things that we're doing that I didn't mention?"

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,320
"What are things that I'm saying we're doing and we're not?"

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,560
In this presentation, I got input from our team.

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,900
Provide feedback channels that are accessible,

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,390
non argumentative and genuine.

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:49,750
Half that is corporate speak and half of that are just really big words so I'll break it down a little bit.

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,680
Feedback channels, ways to communicate, they should be accessible.

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,350
Meaning if you want to get feedback through email

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,930
you should be checking your email and responding to it.

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,160
It should be easy for people to get a hold of you.

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,549
There should be a system. There should be expectations.

00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:17,260
Non-argumentative. Meaning, you're not gonna fight about

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,660
when somebody gives you feedback, they should not expect to fight.

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,880
They should expected to be heard, not necessarily agreed with but heard and understood.

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,670
And in someway, acted upon. Even if that action is to do nothing.

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,789
Finally, genuine. You have to really mean it you can't just say, "Here's a survey, please fill it out."

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,130
and then not look it. You have to actually look at it, think about it and

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,820
analyze the results. "What does it mean that these four people said this and

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,800
these 10 people said that?" It's really important.

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,860
How many of you have heard about Toyota's Andon Cord?

00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,040
Toyota the car company has a manufacturing line

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,900
and they have this cord that runs all along the entire stretch of the line.

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,140
Anybody can reach up and pull it anytime and it stops the line.

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,860
The entire production line stops.

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,140
Now, if this were an American car company, like Ford,

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,159
you cannot stop the line. The line keeps going.

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:26,919
It doesn't matter if you saw something that's broken,

00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,220
you to say, "Hey that's broken. Uhh, I'm gonna put a note on it." Keep going.

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,130
How many times we done that in the project?  "That code doesn't look good"

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,720
"That CSS doesn't make a lot of sense but ... gotta ship it!"

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,060
"Keep going. Somebody else did it but I don't have time."

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,100
"More stuff is coming down the production line. Gotta keep going."

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,400
Toyota has this cord, the Andon Cord. It a Japanese word.

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,300
What makes the cord powerful is that pulling it does not mean you get in trouble.

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,840
When you pull the cord, supervisors do not come running over and say, 

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,210
"Why did you do that? What are you doing? Do you realize how much money we're losing?

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,520
We're losing a million dollars an hour because you pulled that cord."

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,380
They don't do that. If they did that, nobody would pull the cord.

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,140
One person would do that once and they'd react like that, and that'd be the end of it.

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,740
Nobody would ever pull it over again. That's what I mean by

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,820
accessible, non argumentative and genuine. When somebody pulls the cord,

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,060
a supervisor walks over and says,

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:35,940
"What can we do to fix this? What did you see that was wrong? How can we improve it?"

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,040
and they will keep that line stopped as long as possible to fix the problem.

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,280
They lose a lot of money doing it but ultimately, the team is happier and

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,700
Toyota cars are very reliable.

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,140
Hire the right people.

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,400
This is kind of obvious so I'll dig into it a little bit.

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,460
You want to make sure that the people you hire share your values

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,890
and those values should be defined.

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:13,990
You can't just say, "They're not a fit" and not have the criteria for what a fit is.

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,700
Think about your company and what you stand for. What do you want your company to be?

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,840
What are the things that define your culture? Write them down.

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,570
Make them meaningful and genuine.

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,920
Publish them. Put them online.

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,760
Be held accountable for them and now you have rules that help you decide,

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,760
"Should I hire this person? Should we spend money on this event?

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,800
Should be except work from this client?"

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,840
If there's ever a question go back to your values

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,529
they should help you answer those questions.

00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,440
In hiring the right people, there's

00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,720
a little bit the test I like to do.

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,680
I call it 'The Airport Test'.

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,000
That name was invented by a guy named Greg Mattison

00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,230
who is still very well known in the Drupal community.

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,680
The Airport Test is the idea that

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,940
you are stuck in an airport for three hours, for five hours,

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,580
for 10 hours with this person. What does that feel like?

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,590
You're waiting for you flight, it's late, and you want to go home.

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,169
You've been working all week and you're tired, you're irritable.

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,250
What is it like to be with this person? Are they gonna start saying things that

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,110
you don't feel fit with your values?

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,519
They might have certain attitudes that you don't really share about

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,669
how to treat other people or are they gonna get really angry about

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:51,940
the fact that they're sitting and waiting and you're not the kinda person

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,179
wants to get really angry about waiting.

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Think through that.

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,040
This is one we did a couple years ago. We went virtual.

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,960
This means a lot of different things.  Some people call this 'Distributed' or 'Distributed Team'.

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,379
Some people don't like the word virtual because it makes it seem like

00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:22,409
your company isn't real. It's virtual as opposed to real.

00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:25,750
What it means is you don't necessarily have an office and you don't necessarily

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,580
come to the same place everyday.

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,799
How many of you work for distributed companies or virtual companies?

00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,039
Keep your hands up if you don't mind.

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,460
How many of you really like it?

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,390
Did anybody's hands go down? I didn't see any.

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,400
When done well it works. It's great. Why? Because your empowered.

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,850
You can live where you want. You can

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,190
set your own schedule to some degree. If you want to move to a new city

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,400
or if you have to move to the city for family reasons or whatever, you have the freedom to do so. 

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,360
You don't have to give up your job to do that. That's really important.

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,580
It allows a lot of flexibility.

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,960
If you work with people who like to travel in unusual ways like

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,800
get on a boat and go up and down the coast

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,980
for six months but as long as you have an Internet connection

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,720
and certain number office hours were they're working and they're doing good work,

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,780
what does it matter if they're on a boat, or in a house,

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,670
or in an office. The fact that you can grant that person that freedom is

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,350
incredible and very empowering.

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,240
very closely related, let your team set their own schedules. Allow flexible work schedules.

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,760
Where possible, consider something like an open vacation policy.

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,280
Some people call this an unlimited paid leave policy.

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,900
The idea is, take as much vacation as you need when you need it.

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,790
That's it. Nobody's tracking it.

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,380
That seems a little crazy to some people

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,730
but here's the thing, if they abuse that policy

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,360
they're not the right fit because they're letting their teammates down.

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,560
So work with your team to schedule flexible time, to figure out when you can take time off,

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,730
and take the time off you need. It's very empowering.

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,320
Many people in our industry want to be freelancers.

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,800
They want to be contractors. Why do people want to be freelancers?

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,650
Because of this. They can work

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,900
only in the morning or only in the evening or four days a week,

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,700
not five or take a month off in the year to travel

00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,760
because the whole family takes a month off.

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,100
You should invest time and money in your team's success. Time and money.

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,080
This means giving people a budget for professional development. Allowing them to

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,380
travel to events like this if you can and the time off to have these conversations.

00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,920
How many people in the last two days, because we're almost at the end of the second day,

00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,689
how many people have learned something here at DrupalCon in the last two days?

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,300
Everybody, even if you didn't raise your hand. I know you did.

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,660
That was worth it. You're going to take back the inspiration

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,720
and the energy and the ideas and everything else that you learned

00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,360
to your organization. Whether you

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,600
teach them what you learn or if you just go back with a better attitude, it was worth it.

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,300
Allow them the time and give them some kind of a budget if you can to invest in their own development

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,040
This is a really important one for us

00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:15,630
and I think this one actually scares people more than anything else.

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,510
Encourage personal brands.

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,780
See, he didn't like it.

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,240
A personal brand is the idea that you are really good at what you do

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,160
and you were known for what you do if you want to be known. 

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,940
People recognize you

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,039
and they want to talk to you and if you like to write blog posts about what you do, you can do that.

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,760
Some company owners get really afraid when people they work with

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,080
start to become famous, because they're afraid they're going to leave.

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,610
If you're afraid that the people you work with are going to leave

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,830
because they're going to get too good at their job and too well-known,

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,690
then there's something wrong with your organization.

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,560
Because what are you doing? You're deliberately holding them back.

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,820
You're not allowing them the time or the budget to get good at what they do.

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
You're stifling them.

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,660
That's a hard truth. People don't want to hear that. But if you're not allowing people

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,260
to grow and allow them to leave if they

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,270
really do get too good at their job and you can't sustain them at your

00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,920
organization, absolutely, you should help them find another place,

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,100
another career. Because they're not going to be happy with you and their work will suffer.

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,100
We have an expression in English. I have no idea if it translates: if you love something, set it free.

00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,380
If you really want people to succeed you have to let them go if they want.

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,700
The benefit is, if you're the kind of organization that allows people to do this

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,420
and celebrates it, they will almost certainly stay

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,420
because they're happy there.

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:31,160
This helps eliminate the "I am NOT my job" divide.

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,580
In what we do, knowledge, work, web,

00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,740
technology, we are our jobs.

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,370
We actually are. We do take it home with us

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,020
because we're passionate about it. For some people, that's not the case and

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,180
that's fine. But for some organizations, it really is a passion.

00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,780
For people who are passionate about it they want to build personal brand.

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,740
One final thought. There's a lot of talk about work/life balance.

00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,480
I want to work some amount and I want to have a life outside of work and that's very healthy

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,789
and everybody should have that. That's very important. But at the same time,

00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,851
I don't necessarily believe in work/life separation. 

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,380
I think that they're two things that should be in balance,

00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:30,469
but they're not necessarily entirely separate.

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,060
If what you want to do is innovate and you really cool things in your organization and change the world, 

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,500
you're doing it 24 hours a day even in your sleep. If that's the kind of organization you want to be

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,420
you need to be that. Own it. If you don't want to do that, don't do that. That's okay.

00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,399
Adopt agile methodologies. Scrum, Con Bon, 

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,419
Extreme Programming

00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,669
pair per you know anything that allows you to work

00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,530
on a project in a more agile way and work with your clients

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,710
in an agile way.

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,400
Built into the core of agile development is the idea the team's self organize

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,500
around projects and problems.

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,000
The team decides what it's going to do, who's gonna work on it, when it's done.

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,760
That's a lot of empowerment. You're giving the team the control

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,369
over what's going to be done in the project to some degree.

00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,419
Also built into empowerment is the idea of

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,929
getting feedback. Always ask for feedback every day

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,619
constantly understand what's working and not working. Agile methodologies

00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,240
has this idea of retrospectives or retros.

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,410
You do a retro at the end a

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,250
a period of work, like a sprint.

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,540
What went well? What did not go well? How can we improve?

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,710
You're asking those every week or every two weeks,

00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,170
always getting feedback.

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,330
Don't tell people how to do things.

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,380
Give people goals.

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,940
Let them figure out how to do it. Do what you want, how you want to do it.

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,600
The technology in the tools that you use in your organization should be decided by your team,

00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,130
not a manager. The team is the one using them

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,970
so if they don't like your project management tool,

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,520
if they don't like Jira or

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,540
other tools, if they really don't like it work with them to find another and switch.

00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,180
Because it's something we have to do all the time

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,720
and every time they go into that thing they hate it,

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,560
and then they hate you a little bit more because you picked it. Let them pick it

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,099
and if you try new thing it doesn't work,

00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,040
throw it away. Do something else. Yeah its painful, but

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,119
the team sees how much you care about their input because

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,800
you generally do. You've invested in a new tool or new technology, you've spent

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,890
all the time migrating to it. You're working in it,

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,750
didn't work well okay on to the next thing.

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,200
Set boundaries beyond what the person currently feels.

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,619
This is a little complicated. Here's what I mean.

00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,579
Some people take power.

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,000
Some people need to have their expectations set beyond what they currently believe

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,780
in order to find that power.  Some people say, "You know what?

00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,220
I'm gonna learn this thing over here because I want to get better

00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,520
my job. I'm gonna do this thing I've never done before. I'm gonna take over

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,640
this story because it's not getting done

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,760
and somebody needs to do it. I'm gonna do it." Some people

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,410
are like that. Some people are not. If you really want to build a culture of

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,589
empowerment and demonstrate that everybody can do this

00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,349
and it's not just up to the people who go out take it and then they get praised

00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:21,220
for it, create opportunities for people who don't

00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,880
take power to receive praise.

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,860
Tell them, "Hey, there's the story

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,350
in the backlog that nobody's touching.

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,170
why don't you give it a try? You can do it." "Oh, but I don't really know much about..."

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,650
"I bet you could learn. Give it a week. I bet you can figure it out.

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,920
I know you can figure it out because you've figured out a bunch of other things in the past."

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,700
They'll figure it out and

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,760
they will volunteer again in the future.

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,510
They will take that power in the future because you have empowered them.

00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,920
A lot of business owners and managers take a long time

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,770
stepping out of the work because they feel like,

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,950
"Oh but I know all this stuff and I've been working with this client for two years and

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,640
but you know I don't know this person is not really up to speed on SASS 

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,800
or on whatever technology you're using."

00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,640
Accept the fact that they know more than you do because you hired them and

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,700
you should be hiring people better than you all the time.

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,560
These people who know more about your work than you do

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,630
because you're a manager now, you're not actually doing work anymore.

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,700
You're doing a different kind of work.  You're doing this work.

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,510
They know more about it. They're in the weeds.

00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,930
They're working every day with the client. They should have a lot say

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,790
in what the company does.

00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:09,840
Because they see what clients, need what projects need, all the new technologies that are out there.

00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,580
They're trying new things. They're failing and succeeding.

00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,790
Ask them about their vision

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,180
for where the web is going or technology.

00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,490
They know more about it than you do.

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,090
And finally,

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,340
You have to constantly reaffirm this. Constantly exemplify, 

00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,860
pursue and praise empowerment. When somebody is empowered,

00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,980
you say, "Hey, they did this really cool thing." Point it out. Celebrate it.

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,580
If people don't feel like they're empowered or they say they're not empowered

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,760
you have to figure out how to solve that and constantly work with them.

00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,500
Reinforce, reinforce, reinforce.

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,000
One final thought about this. Asking for help

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of strength.

00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,900
It's a sign of knowing what you don't know and being comfortable with that.

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,140
People should never feel like,

00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,320
"I don't want to ask for help because then it's going to seem like

00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,100
I don't know what I'm doing" or "Everybody else is really busy" 

00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,080
Because what's gonna happen is that thing that you need help with, it's not going to fix itself

00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,869
and you're not gonna be able to fix it is you need help doing it. So it's going to fail.

00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,969
Then everybody's gonna wanna know why.

00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:40,420
If you ask for help you were actually showing that you are strong, not weak.

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,119
So this idea of empowerment changes everything. When empowered,

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,400
a person benefits the company,

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,940
not the other way around. Here's what I mean by this.

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,240
Traditionally. the company is this big thing with lots of little people.

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,800
The company is big and powerful and there lots of little people there.

00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,490
The people they all rely on the company

00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,690
for everything. The company gives them a salary.

00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,090
The company gives them a job. The company a gives them

00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:25,900
professional development and career growth. But when they are empowered

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,500
the company becomes smaller in a way.

00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,060
In this case, the people are allowing the company

00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,420
to succeed. The people are giving to the company and that is in fact what's happening.

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,900
We spend a third of our lives at work.

00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,330
A third of our lives at work.

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,260
We are giving a third our lives to our jobs. They give us something in return,

00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,660
but the company, the job, should be more grateful than we are.

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,040
Always. That is empowerment.

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,490
Empowerment makes everyone happier

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,000
and better at their jobs. The teams are happier,

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,970
they like their work more, quality goes up,

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,100
people stick around. They stay, they don't quit.

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,740
Clients are happier because quality is up,

00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:32,180
people aren't leaving. Clients never like it when a person leaves a project.

00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,200
you have to explain like, "Oh our lead

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,840
architect just left and we're going to have to replace them and its going to take a month to ramp up."

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,380
Finally, leadership. it's less work for business managers,

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,840
it actually takes a lot of work out of their hands so they can focus on the future

00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,600
and facilitating empowering their team. So this change is worth it.

00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,600
Preguntas?

00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,480
Questioner: I completely agree with you.

00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:34,650
What I would say with some of the challenges that we have

00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,900
also talking from your perspective on

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,229
culture. The culture in Latin 

00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:44,380
America is a little bit different, of course, then from

00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,519
the US. Some of the challenges

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,660
to apply some of the concepts like, free time or

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,219
or open-door schedule,

00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,910
or take any vacation when you want ...

00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,109
It's hard to apply when the culture is very different

00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:06,390
especially in a culture like the US that is very centric,

00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,499
and individual verses the culture of Latin America

00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:14,160
that is a bit more community based.

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,049
Do you have any suggestions or any experience on

00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:21,749
how to handle that based on your distributive

00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:25,759
team it has to do with? Very good question.

00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:29,699
I don't have a lot of suggestions

00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,719
actually on how on how to implement this in

00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,449
in areas are cultures where a lot of these things are difficult.

00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:41,209
I'll give you an example. So the idea of ...

00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:44,319
I'll put it this way: these are challenges

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,589
in the United States. The stuff that I've talked about now

00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:51,840
is really unusual in the United States. This is not the typical thing at all.

00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,720
This is very forward-thinking. When you think of something like the

00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:00,910
open vacation policy, people can take off

00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,199
however much time they want. There's some really

00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,469
unusual legal problems with that in the United States

00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:11,170
so everybody is experiencing this. Specifically,

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,910
the state of California. The state of California is a problem

00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:21,910
in lots of ways ...

00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,790
The state of California has a policy that says

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,300
if you leave your job or if you're fired your employer

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,960
has to pay all accrued time off.

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,160
If you have saved up

00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,630
three weeks of vacation they have to pay you three extra weeks of

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,910
salary when you leave or are dismissed.

00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:49,120
When you have an open vacation policy, is that

00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,780
infinite time? This is a real legal question

00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,970
in California and I don't think it's been tested in court yet. But when people

00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,940
have, Netflix has this policy,

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,950
for example. They're kind of famous for it. When somebody leaves Netflix,

00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,450
and they're mad, are they going to sue Netflix

00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,310
and say, "You owe me for the rest of my working life?" I don't know.

00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,500
We haven't tested that yet. This is a new policy.

00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,190
Also in Finland, there is

00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,570
I've heard this sort of second hand so

00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,380
I may be ruining the story, but there's some kinda policy

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,510
that says there is a minimum amount

00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,860
time off that is enforced by criminal law,

00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,710
in Finland, and I think it's five weeks even

00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:46,060
if you are a business owner and you want to work,

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,820
you have to take time off. So guess what everybody does. They lie.

00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,550
All the business owners who have to work because this is

00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:58,160
the job, they have to lie and say, "Yeah I took

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,250
five weeks off" or "I took two weeks here and three weeks there" and

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,870
they're working secretly on their own company.

00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:10,830
It's kind of silly. So these are big ideas

00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,900
that are new for everybody.

00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,700
In places where it's especially difficult, which may be

00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,100
Colombia, I would suggest that

00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,619
you should see this as maybe

00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:30,339
some inspiration or a way to start thinking a little bit differently

00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:36,879
about work or find the things that you feel really touch you

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,150
emotionally. Like what you like about this and see if there are ways that you can maybe

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,770
work with the system you have

00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,869
or even in some cases work against to change it. Because there are things

00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,940
even in the United States that we have two work against.

00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:00,060
Here's another example: The Airport Test that I talked about earlier.

00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,120
Can you sit in an airport with this person for five hours and not hate them.

00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:10,539
I wrote about this, I forget where, on some business 

00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:14,859
magazine and I was all excited because I got published in

00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:19,890
this business magazine. It was really cool. But I made the mistake of

00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,690
reading internet comments about my own article

00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,910
and luckily this being a business website

00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,329
it wasn't like YouTube. They were actually

00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:33,299
thoughtful but they kind of rip me to shreds on the policy

00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:43,859
because they said that that the airport test sounded like a way to enforce

00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:50,220
discriminatory hiring practices. You're just gonna hire people that you get

00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,579
along with and chances are that means the people that have the same

00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,640
background as you, that speak the same language as you, that are a lot like you,

00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,190
probably look like you.

00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:05,290
Then all these other biases come into play and you know what they're kind of right.

00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:10,200
I've had to shift the way I think about that airport policy because

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,319
its more about values now than it is getting along with somebody

00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,900
its, "Do you share the same values? Do you have the same goals?"

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,490
That's what you want to think about. Not necessarily if can we tell each other the

00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:26,970
same jokes and will we think they're funny.

00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,970
Any other questions?

00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,180
Just one moment. We're gonna pass the mic to you.

00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,660
Questioner: In Argentina in 2001 there was social upheaval.

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,440
Many factory owners tried to close their factories.

00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,060
What the workers did in many cases is they took over the factory and

00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,920
they made the factory work on their own and became successful with certain limitations.

00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,290
This has happened in Chicago with the glass company

00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,400
and in France also with a watch company.

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,200
In that sense, that's the kind of sense where I want to tell you

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,720
exactly what I feel. I think that it's a very courageous

00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,960
presentation. Very fresh ideas

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,100
If your company is implementing half of this, 

00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,820
where is the job application from?

00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,900
On the other hand ...

00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,780
Given the fact ...

00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,220
I think what we're heading for in this presentation

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:44,340
is to optimize a difficult situation and I have to say in true honesty is 

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,560
my impression that I want to share with you

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,870
is that there's dialogue going on

00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:56,830
in all the language statements. It's a dialogue with the manager

00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:02,030
which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that.

00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:08,190
But what we're doing here is trying to design a benevolent dictator.

00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,700
The root problem will not be solved until there's no dictator.

00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,760
So it has to be ... I don't know.

00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,900
There are experiments cooperatives. There are experiments

00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,170
in different kind designs of companies.

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:37,900
I guess a benevolent dictator is better than a non benevolent dictator who

00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,690
ruins the company and all the projects fail and so on and so forth.

00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:49,460
But since there is a fundamental difference in that the manager or the owner

00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,870
owns the means of production in the knowledge

00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,770
factory. It's an insurmountable ...

00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,400
I mean, there's a problem there. So in any case I just wanted to share that with you

00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,040
I do think, I've just given a presentation on the lean

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,020
approaches and evidently I agree with you that I mean

00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,040
the these techniques have to be put

00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,820
into operation because that's the state of affairs

00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,410
right now. I did get that feeling that

00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:23,280
the the dialogue is with the manager only and

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,810
some even know I'm owner/director

00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,830
the small group of people

00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,920
why isn't the dialogue also with

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,510
the people who work at the company?

00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,970
But in any case, it's just rules again. I just wanted to share 

00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,200
my feelings about

00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,950
listening to you and thank you very much.

00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:57,230
Presenter: A couple thoughts, there are a lot of interesting things that we could talk

00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,310
about as it relates to the power structures and hegemony

00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,380
all those things and that's the kinda stuff I love to talk about.

00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,730
But I'm gonna focus it very tightly on

00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,010
just this presentation and just some of the ideas we we talked about here

00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:14,690
because I will say that there's a lot of political ideology

00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,570
that goes into that as well. I think it's all well founded and I would

00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,420
describe myself personally as sort of a weird mix

00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,900
of a capitalist an anarchist.

00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,880
I know that seems maybe like they're at odds but that's just what I'm like.

00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,920
The audience for this presentation, it's interesting

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,490
and I think it's very valid feedback,

00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:45,390
very constructive, critical feedback to hear that you feel that it's

00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,260
almost exclusively directed managers.

00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,630
True, usually when I give the presentation like this

00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,760
is to managers and other business owners because I'm trying to change their minds about things.

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,040
At the same time I want to have another information here for people who are not

00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,580
In a management position or ownership position to make them think,

00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:10,200
"Hey I'm not being treated fairly.

00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,350
There are some suggestions I could make my organization

00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,920
to do this." I think maybe casting a ... there's definitely some intent

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,370
but it may not be clear so I take that to heart and I

00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:26,450
I hope to expand on it in the future. We're about one minute overtime

00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,400
I'd like to take one more question and then we'll wrap up and then I'll be here

00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,300
and I can talk for a few more minutes.

00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,200
Yessir?

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,610
Questioner: I have two questions, the second one I'll ask after.

00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:42,920
You have all these philosophy

00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:50,220
and a way ... really a manifesto for people how to

00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:55,940
be a colleague with the people they manage or supervise or vice versa.

00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,770
When you see examples of

00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,030
really bad management,

00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,630
kind of like a dictatorship

00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:11,750
style like Steve Jobs, and these companies are so successful.

00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:15,110
To keep naming people ...

00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,220
Bill Gates.

00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,540
All of them have these kinda like dictatorship style

00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:27,130
like "my way or the highway" and the are so successful.

00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,560
What kind of message is this? 

00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,680
It's questionable.

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,320
You're so successful because you're a dictatorship.

00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,980
Presenter: I think about that a lot

00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:47,320
because I think a lot about Steve Jobs in particular.

00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,390
and it's interesting that you mention him as an example because he's the

00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,370
opposite of all this

00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:54,620
and yet Apple is the wealthiest

00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,750
company in the world, has more cash on hand

00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,100
than any company has ever had, and they continue to innovate and all kinds a

00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,560
impressive things.

00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,710
I don't know enough yet about Tim Cook to

00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,310
know what his style is like. I think they're still

00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,930
feeling that out over there.  I imagine he's probably a lot like Steve Jobs.

00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,990
Why else would he hand off the company to anyone else

00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,550
other than someone like himself? I think there are basically two kinds of companies in the world.

00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,780
There's the Steve Jobs kind of company

00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,260
and there's what I think we're aspiring to be here.

00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:41,040
I think that, and this goes towards your question from earlier, looking at the political questions

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,940
around power and structure. In our world, we live in a very

00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,090
capitalist world so companies like Apple

00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,270
through a dictator like model,

00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:59,060
I'm using that word very loosely, they succeed really well within the system

00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,270
that has been built. At the same time,

00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,320
I think that some people are actually really motivated. I don't understand it

00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,750
myself because I'm not motivated

00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,740
that way but I think some people are genuinely motivated by fear,

00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,060
by being constantly pushed

00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,240
to go farther and farther and farther into you feel like you ..

00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,790
you know, look at how athletes train. Athletes train because they're

00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,600
constantly pushed beyond their limits

00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,530
in the heel and they get better in the keep going. If athletes were trained

00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:32,290
because the coach said, "Hey that's good enough. I'm your buddy.

00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:35,820
Let's go get beers." Would they ever make it to the Olympics?

00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,330
Maybe not. Now that may not be a fair

00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:45,510
comparison but some people are motivated by being pushed really hard and really far.

00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:49,430
Those people really like working at Apple

00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:54,650
I know people work at Apple and they love it. They love that kinda stuff. I would not

00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,850
do well there at all. What's interesting though is that

00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:04,980
companies like what we're aspiring to be,

00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,660
aren't usually very big. We're pretty small

00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,460
and we get into some really interesting political discussions now about

00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,609
well as that because the system that we've built that is

00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:22,400
even outside of business, that is social and cultural, is it because companies

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:29,260
like this can only succeed so far? Because other companies are

00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,470
eating up the rest to the pie? Like the Apple's and and the rest.

00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,320
It's almost the philosophical question and it's something that I do think

00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,660
about a lot because there are things about

00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,750
Apple and Steve Jobs I find very inspiring.

00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,920
Their design, how forward-thinking they are.

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,900
Most people think, "Let's figure out what the consumer wants

00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,490
and give them that." or "Let's take something that they have and make it better."

00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,109
But what Apple has done is they've said, "There's this thing

00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:02,720
that you don't even want yet and we're gonna make it so good

00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,560
that its going to be the thing you have to have." That's kind of incredible

00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,050
because it goes against all other logic.

00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,670
They can't look at surveys or reports or sales numbers or anything when they try

00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,130
to do something completely different.

00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,350
Anyway, I could start talking forever about this because I find it fascinating.

00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,360
I'll wrap up now because we're a few minutes over.

00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:26,630
