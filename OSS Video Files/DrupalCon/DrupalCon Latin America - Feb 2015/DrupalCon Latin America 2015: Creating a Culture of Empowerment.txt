Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Creating a Culture of Empowerment
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Todd Nienkerk
En esta charla, Todd Nienkerk platicará acerca de los principos que ha seguido en la creación de Four Kitchens y como tú puedes seguir los mismos principios para crear tu propia compañía.

Drawing on more than thirteen years of leadership at Four Kitchens and other creative organizations, Todd Nienkerk will discuss why empowerment is the foundation of all successful teams.

What is empowerment? Why does it matter? How can an organization create a culture of empowerment?

The guiding principles of empowerment:

Build a company you would want to work for
Give people control over their destiny
Make trust the center of your culture
How to cultivate empowerment:

Personal brands. You shouldn't be afraid that people will leave. If you’re afraid people will become "too good," then you’re not offering something they want — and you know it.
Go virtual. Allow your team the flexibility to work from home — or anywhere in the world.
Adopt agile methodologies. Allow teams to self-organize around projects and problems.
And much, much more...
This session will build off a similar one from Twin Cities DrupalCamp 2014. Slides and a detailed outline are available.
