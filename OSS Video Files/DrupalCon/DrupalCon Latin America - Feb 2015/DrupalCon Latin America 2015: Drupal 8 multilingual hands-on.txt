Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Drupal 8 multilingual hands-on
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: YesCT

Over a thousand people participated in the issues around improving multilingual features and APIs in Drupal 8 for the past three years. There are around a thousand issues, most of which are resolved in this initiative as of this submission making Drupal 8 a truly outstanding release for everybody looking to create even single language non-English sites but especially those making multilingual sites. Although there will surely be contributed modules useful to round out multilingual sites in Drupal 8, there is support for way more than there was in Drupal 7 core and even if you add in all available contributed modules - and with less code and more unified approaches.

This lab aims to provide a hands-on way showing you around all the great improvements and gives tips as to how to best utilize the new solutions. We will also talk about where contributed modules will still be needed.

The ideal attendee at this session has some experience in Drupal 6 or 7 foreign language and/or multilingual site building, however those who have no experience in foreign/multilingual site building will also get a lot out of it.

We will continue in the big exhibit hall room at 2:15, near the mentor table.

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,609
multilingual hands on land it was

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:13,189
originally created by gabor and Amy and

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:16,359
it's provided um as an open source

00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:20,269
presentation that any person can give um

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,400

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,320
to demonstrate the multilingual

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,949
capabilities of Drupal 8 and I think

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,220
that you will see on that you will agree

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:52,099
with Tobias with T Steckler when he says

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:54,139
that um dribble 8 in core has more

00:04:52,099 --> 00:05:01,070
multilingual capabilities than Drupal 7

00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:05,870
with all of contribs Cathy phase I'm a

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:09,380

people who have commitment shins so

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,480

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,350
a lot more contributors than that on

00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,720

the language module interface

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:40,310
translation content translation config

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,110

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,800
mentor table in the general area we can

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,200

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,380
presentation but later to 15 by the

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,240
mentor table we can meet again and

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:12,020
continue so we're going to look at

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:18,680
language interface content and config

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:28,700
and this is the step-by-step handout bit

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:34,670
ly / d8 mi- lab- handout okay so what we

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:36,530
have also is um a demo of a site a

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,320
multilingual site built with Drupal 8

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,570
core and this demo project is on

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,000
drupal.org and if you've never used

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:48,320
simply test at me before it's amazing

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,040
you can give a URL like this one too

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,070
people that you work with or clients or

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,470
anything like that if it's on drupal.org

00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,260
simply test me we'll build a site based

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,990
upon the URL so this builds a Drupal 8

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,750
site from the distribution multilingual

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,500
demo in the cloud so you can try this

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:16,780
right now if you want simply test me /

project / multilingual underscore demo /

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:25,550
8 X 1 X and that will start a site it's

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,020
very fast simply test me it's very fast

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,390
and it will start the end result of the

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:37,610
demo for you that you can play with so

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:46,250

really okay there we go

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,880
oh I didn't start

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,829
okay so uh when you have a nice URL for

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,029
simply test me it fills out the form

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,560
with all the versions and things and

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,569
then you launch the sandbox if you

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,810
haven't registered on simply test me

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:42,370

save and continue no not for the demo

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:22,180
yeah for the demo I would stick with the

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:26,820
English install and then you leave that

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,820
all the defaults and you just keep

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
saving

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:49,680
okay so please do that also we're going

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:52,610
to let this run a little bit and this

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,070
will give you the end result of the demo

00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:04,920
but let's start building it ourselves

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:08,160
okay all right we're going to um we're

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:14,970
going to build with a beta version of

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:17,960
Drupal 8 we want beta 6 so if you're

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,900
looking at the handout with the steps

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,690
and you can find a link to the handout

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,610
from the session page on the drupalcon

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,200
website so if you find this session page

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,240
on the drupalcon website there will be a

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,020
link to the handout so you can follow

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,880
along on and on there is some links and

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:49,440
some instructions for how to install

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:51,240
Drupal 8 a beta 6 um okay and for our

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,480
demo I thought since we were here we

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:59,700
will install in Spanish so held on a

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,760
second so if you want to do this also

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:07,890
you can make a new tab a new window and

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:10,550
go to simply test me and pick um pick

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,550
Drupal core

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,120
so here if you just type slowly

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,990
and the Wi-Fi works it will autocomplete

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:50,700
Drupal core and pick the answer that

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,700
comes up that is Drupal core

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,860
and then after you pick Drupal core

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:04,770
there will be a drop down on the side

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,960
and you want to pick a beta 6 so just

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,960
like that beta 6 and then launch the

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,760
sandbox so this will get you the same

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,830
Drupal 8 beta 6 that I have locally you

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,630
can have this but it's in the it's up on

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:27,150
the server somewhere and your site will

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:29,460
only last three hours okay yeah I am

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,580
installing Drupal a web sites in my

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,270
localhost do I need any additional model

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,030
or it is all in clinical it's all in

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,920
core which is what makes this so

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:46,380
excellent all right so I started this

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:49,350
earlier so um okay so yeah so once you

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,260
start installing pick pick a Spanish and

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,790
then save and continue and then just

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,550
keep saying all the defaults and when

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,120
you're done with that the site will look

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,120
like this

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:20,250
so in Drupal 8 it's multilingual the

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,870
install right from the beginning the

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,410
very first thing that you do is you pick

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,600
your language and the translation file

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,890
is downloaded and available during the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,410
install so you can answer the install

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,920
questions and the forms in any language

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:43,110
you want and then once your site comes

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:51,630
up the UI strings are already translated

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:53,820
for you so this is really great okay

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:58,320
when you install in another language it

00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:02,580
turns on the language module for you but

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,650
we can check and see how that where that

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:09,830
setting is so if you go to manage

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:17,940
configuration regional and language

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:26,670
languages it's um yeah rhian needle me

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:32,960
uh thank you idioma I could I knew I

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,960
could do it idioma Annie luego idiomas

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:43,020
ok esta bien y mira solamente esta

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:49,290
espanol ok no Stan in Glace right so

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:54,410
this is really good and you can add more

00:15:49,290 --> 00:16:03,000
languages here ok so um let's add a

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:07,850
Hungarian and English and French it

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,110
looks like Hungary yeah

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,110
so honk REO

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:32,090
yeah so um c function Inland Sea

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:35,120
functional correcto it downloads the

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,640
translation file automatically so you

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,650
don't have to download it and put it in

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,230
your code base and upload it to your

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:48,470
server you just say add and it's just

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:50,300
there it's Drupal 8 so sometimes it

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,550
works sometimes it doesn't but when we

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,680
release it will totally works like this

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,280
and then in the beta 6 it does so you

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,500
can see here see a Hungarian it says i'm

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:13,370
seventy two percent of the strings are

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:17,510
translated i'll just run back okay see a

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:23,930
cake hello ha ma circa CA que quiero

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:26,980

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:41,780
despues de creer todo el el el site Oh

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:46,010
solamente traduce a a core uh those can

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:53,480
I answer in English the files for the UI

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:59,270
strings on our core pedal modules where

00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:02,740
they provide p 0 files for their user

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,740
strings tambien

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,980
ah so if you have user if you have a

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,860
user interface strings in a custom

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:18,620
module in your custom module you can

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:23,910
make a p.o file for your user strings

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,650
yeah and you can add languages whenever

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,690
you want you don't have to do it at the

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,280
beginning you can build it and add more

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:39,170
languages later but we're doing it at

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:39,170
the beginning here hmm okay Oh

00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:53,969
does it does it does it translate my

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:56,129
pages right so this what we're doing

00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:59,489
right now is only going to give us the

00:18:56,129 --> 00:19:02,099
admin UI strings in order to translate

00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:04,169
your content and you do it a little

00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:08,129
different and you have to do that

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:17,129
yourself and we'll hopefully we will

00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:19,829
hopefully I'll show you how oh yeah so

00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:22,619
Tripoli is not done yet so we have

00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:28,009
several open issues for example we have

00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:35,549
an issue these um el nombre de idiomas

00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:38,159
estan en glaze pero todo para espanol so

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,719
this will we will fix this it's okay if

00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,699
you want to help me fix it you could

00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:47,699
come on thursday i know exactly this

00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:51,619
issue okay so let's see um so we can see

00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:55,499
what this looks like so let's go to UM

00:19:51,619 --> 00:20:02,119
/h you so just take the admin config off

00:19:55,499 --> 00:20:06,449
the end of your URL and make /h you good

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:11,899
and so now you can see the admin

00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:11,899
interface strings are in Hungarian okay

00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:17,579
all right oh if you're following along

00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:20,669
in the PDF or the or the google doc you

00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:23,429
will see some sections the title begins

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:25,379
with the word skip that means we're not

00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,749
going to try and do that right now but

00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:29,549
we can try and do it later and they're

00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:31,649
also in a different color to help you

00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:33,449
find your way to the next part that

00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:40,679
we're going to do so the next part we're

00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:45,539
going to do is um in kahina cinco and it

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,979
says observe content language page so

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,469
what we want to do is we want to go to

00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:52,999
manage configuration regional and

00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:52,999
language content language

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:18,110
okay so this is the content language

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:21,080
page and just try clicking on these

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,870
things so click a couple of them maybe

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:29,269
the block block one at the top and maybe

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:31,730
content content needle so and then if

00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:36,070
you look below now we have some tables

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,259
here and what we can do is set a default

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:43,340
language for content that's created of

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:47,059
that type and we can enable a clang gwa

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:51,169
juror so we just want to look at that

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,879
here um but this is the page where you

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,009
can set those settings so one of the

00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,929
cool things we can do in Drupal 8 if you

00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:01,460
go to the top of this page if you scroll

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:04,429
up I there's a star here yesterday huh

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,029
see in and go ahead and do that and what

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:11,600
that does is it adds a ort cut I didn't

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:18,710
know this word before last night uh at

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:20,389
the home hmm a paddle I thought huh okay

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,860
so that's pretty cool that's where we

00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:24,519
have the language settings and we can

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,590
make shortcuts let's go down now and

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:31,399
let's make some content so we're going

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,750
to create a custom block and we don't

00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,769
have to save any settings there and

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,460
that's fine so we're going to go to

00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:41,149
manage structure block layout which is

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:51,320
administration s trip Laura E the same

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:56,049
yo they block okay ii luego let's add a

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,070
shortcut here too so we click the star

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:02,120
because we're going to come back here

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:05,570
later okay now um let's make a block so

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,519
let's do add custom block I'm okay

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:13,370
better sonali does got oh okay and here

00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:17,450
let's just put on some words so we can

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:23,059
put explore our el mundo es el ejemplo

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:24,490
and so um the example for the demo okay

00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:28,490
that's good

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:40,130
yeah and in the body you can put

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:42,919
palabras y luego a quarter right so then

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:46,190
we save it now it will come back you can

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,640
see the title is still there and then if

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:53,570
you go down and let's pick for their

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:59,210
region primera barra that's wrong the

00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:04,370
first side bar bien and then got our

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:06,169
otra vez o que é um it's hard to see

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,970
because we're zoomed in here for the

00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,610
recording right but maybe on your screen

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:14,419
you have more real estate but if we look

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,250
for a primera bata let the ROM you can

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:20,630
see here is your block and you can move

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:25,600
it maybe we move it to the top and then

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,600
go to the bottom and guard our otra vez

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:34,549
okay so now let's use on the nice back

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:40,039
to the site button that we have regresar

00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:42,710
el siglo and and here is our block okay

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,360
and it also has quick edit links which

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,889
are really nice but we're not going to

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,600
mess with that right now so now we have

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:51,470
a block okay so now we're going to skip

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,049
some more things okay we want to return

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,210
to the content language page but we made

00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:58,880
a shortcut for that so now we can go to

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:04,690
our shortcuts and go to Idi Amin del

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,690
Conte Conte needle yeah

00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:12,029
okay so now let's show the language

00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:13,949
selectors on the create and edit pages

00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:17,509
let's do that for a bunch of different

00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:23,339
types of content let's do it four blocks

00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:29,729
content custom menu link and taxonomy

00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:33,570
trims okay and then four on each of

00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:35,459
these let's pick the setting for show

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:45,089
language selector on content and edit

00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:51,629
pages Westra i'll select the one see

00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:55,429
each other okay so now let's go back to

00:25:51,629 --> 00:26:01,169
the home page again go back to the site

00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:04,739
and if we edit this block and let's do

00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:08,749
um I forget which one let's try that one

00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:11,309
at the edit and then if you scroll down

00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:14,129
you can see here now we have a language

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:17,399
selector so we can say what is this

00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:18,959
maybe we wrote it in French and there

00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:21,089
was no language selector before so we

00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,649
couldn't tell it was in French right but

00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,089
now once we give it the language

00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:26,190
selector now we can write it in whatever

00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:28,019
language we want tell it what language

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,399
it is and we can translate it later we

00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,309
don't always have to write in the same

00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,869
language first okay so we can leave that

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:39,089
that was in Spanish that's good um okay

00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:41,579
now when we earlier when we switch to

00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:44,399
Hungarian we went to the URL and we put

00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:48,739
hu but that's not convenient right so

00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:54,119
let's enable the language switcher block

00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:57,409
um so we can go to our shortcut for the

00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,409
same yo you okay

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,580
great so now we're at admin structure

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:12,639
block and we want to find the block on

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:17,860
the well I might be a la derecha here

00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:20,559
maybe collapse this no that's not what

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,929
we weren't course I think it's off to

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,470
the side I mean we can't see it a real

00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:32,400
opinion or it might be done

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:32,400
I mean it's yeah go down more

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,000
here they are ok so my screen is narrow

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,260
so they're at the bottom of my screen

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,330
but they might be on a lado derecho part

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:53,120
for you we want to find the one that

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:55,940
says um out Fernando de idiomas there we

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:01,640
go under system yeah that's the language

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:06,350
switcher block and then we can pick its

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,720
region I think yeah so there's the

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,500
region and let's put it in the same

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:19,670
place Oh mismo lugar primero para

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:22,160
lateral okay and I think maybe we might

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,530
want to save again gwadar otra vez yeah

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,830
maybe move it to up to top again good

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,420
and then we'll save it I think the save

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:35,660
is in the middle because that's the

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:37,580
sidebar yeah there we go ok and then

00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:41,150
let's go back to the site again you can

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:44,750
either pick home or we can go back to

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,270
the site great okay super so now we can

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,450
see here our language switcher block and

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:53,660
we can click on them and will notice the

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,790
URL changes so we installed in Spanish

00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,020
so Spanish is the default language

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:04,880
there's no es for Spanish there's only

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:08,630
on two letter language codes in the URL

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,340
for the languages that we added there's

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,260
an issue to make your default language

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,140
you can also specify one if you want to

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,550
do that but that's not working it um but

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,310
this is really nice because your default

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:23,500
language is your default language okay

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,500
so now let's do something else

00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,110
let's translate something so that when

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,090
we click on the language switcher black

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:36,290
we can see our content change that will

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,390
help you with with your question um so

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,950
what we need to do is enable the content

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:43,040
language module then we don't need to

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:47,930
download it it comes with core so we

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:56,060
just want to go to manage extend extend

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:58,610
their okay now Mira if it's muy bueno

00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:02,140
there's our search here that this buscar

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:05,120
and so you just need to like escribe

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,460
translation or start or something it

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,380
since there you go so now we have

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,750
content translation it's really easy to

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,780
find the module you want and let's save

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,780
that

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:27,670
okay fantastic so now um I don't know

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:34,210
because this is mobile if you if you

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:36,280
search for the same module again oh yeah

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,950
my screen is too narrow mobile hides

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,780
some of the extra columns here but if

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,860
you have a wide screen and you search

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:47,740
for content translation over here on the

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,720
Left will be and link to go right to the

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,430
configuration page so you don't have to

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,470
know where the configuration pages you

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,940
go you like I enabled this module I want

00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,130
to configure it and the link is right

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,660
there um but I know where it is it's

00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,890
just in the language of section so we're

00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,330
going to go there again we're going to

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:07,270
go to administration configuration and

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:09,640
if you click on the arrows on the sign

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,860
you get the administration menu without

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,410
reloading the page which makes it faster

00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,450
which is nice and then yeah region and

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:20,310
languages and then we want to go to

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,310
content translation yeah

00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,079
okay now the thing that is different

00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:33,079
here if you scroll down a little bit it

00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:35,179
still has saved that we want to show the

00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,459
language selector and if we had picked

00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,339
it default language it knows that too

00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:43,309
but now we have a new column which is is

00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:45,529
it translatable and so we can check off

00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:50,269
and say yes we want to translate the

00:31:45,529 --> 00:32:01,929
content so let's pick um translatable

00:31:50,269 --> 00:32:10,629
four blocks yeah let's do blocks and

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:10,629
taxonomy terms and then let's save this

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,580
ok and then scroll down a little bit

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,160
after you save and what you'll see is

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,500
that it keeps on the settings that you

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,570
have changed open so you know what is

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,850
different from the default which is very

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,179
nice let's make something else

00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:40,130
translatable let's translate the article

00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:41,870
and basic page ok now let's scroll up a

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,130
little bit and look at article here so

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,860
what happened when we said we wanted to

00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,380
translate article is we are shown all of

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,140
the translatable fields and we can say

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,690
yes translate or no translate all on the

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,990
same administrative page you do not have

00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,360
to go to manage field and each one click

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:02,150
yes translatable or no you can do it all

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,559
in one page this is really nice also if

00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,590
you scroll down a little bit to where

00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:10,460
the file is the image here you can see

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:15,710
there are some nice defaults so here

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:18,290
under image the file our cable is not

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:21,350
translatable by default I think most of

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:24,799
the time the image of your shoes are the

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,950
same in Spanish and in English right but

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:30,919
the alt tag and the title need to be

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,150
translatable ok so then we can go down

00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,150
to the bottom and save this again

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:50,340
ok so now let's translate some content

00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:54,360
first we're going to make a piece of

00:33:50,340 --> 00:34:00,240
content let's make a basic page for

00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:02,220
about us it's yeah it's also it's in the

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,740
shortcuts there some shortcuts come by

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,700
default so there's add content is in the

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:14,420
shortcuts and then let's pick pagina

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:17,520
massacre ok let's make a title in

00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:26,600
Spanish for about us but I don't know

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:29,970
how to say it sobre I say ogun de ok

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:33,350
esta bien ok ok now we have a language

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:36,240
selector here because on the language

00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,400
administration page we told it to show

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,860
us the language selector so I could

00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,470
write this in english first even though

00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,270
my default language on the site is in

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:47,970
Spanish so let's do that let's make this

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:51,240
English right so let's say about us here

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,680
instead of us erica then yeah so let's

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,420
say hey you know what I'm going to write

00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,910
this in english first I can pick any

00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:01,470
language I went right so about us and

00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:07,980
then let's put words for the body great

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:10,980
and let's also make a menu so I'll add

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,440
the Rachel hope she only still menu yep

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,110
tell it we want one and that title is

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:22,920
fine and the weight is fine also so we

00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:26,190
can just save that ok so now what we see

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,220
in our navigation menu is we see our

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:32,820
title here don't translate it go scroll

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,970
up so here we see about us in English

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,580
right the menu we look at the title of

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,220
the content is in English about us and

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,960
the body which is a field on the content

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,960
type right is also in English

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,880
yeah so now we can let let's translate

00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:02,300
it so we click the tab that says

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:09,170
translate or traducir and we can add a

00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:12,250
translation so let's do Spanish okay and

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,250
I cerca de

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:25,710
y también palabras okay now it we can

00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,569
change the title of the menu but it

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:33,869
won't do anything but let's do it anyway

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:36,900
okay make about us a circle they they

00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:46,160
don't know they put I oh cool base ok

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:57,809
and then let's save this yep ok oh it

00:36:46,160 --> 00:37:00,269
worked ok yes that's what that's what's

00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:02,160
broken about it ok I knew that I did

00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:05,010
that I did this last night ok I knew

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,190
this was broken I just forgot how ok so

00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,109
right so yeah so let me use our language

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,109
switcher and we switch to the Spanish we

00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:15,839
see the content is ok the content title

00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:19,650
is good and the words are good but if we

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,769
switch to English we get the content is

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:25,220
also ok the title of the content is fine

00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:28,079
the words are fine but the menu is

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,460
universal so we don't want that why

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,529
don't we edit why don't we edit this and

00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:36,089
put it back to about us for the menu and

00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,859
then we'll save that and I will show you

00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:41,730
how we translate the menu we can

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:44,819
translate it just not right here ok

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,470
great so this is just the content so if

00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:48,269
you think back to the beginning of the

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,819
talk there were four parts of

00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:53,759
multilingual languages content

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:57,990
translation user interface translation

00:37:53,759 --> 00:38:01,440
and config translation notes like

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,869
articles and pages are content and we

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,630
only turned on content translation

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:09,839
module we also have the user interface

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,910
because we installed in Spanish but we

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,599
have not turned on config translation

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:17,789
and the title of the menu is config so

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,329
we'll get to that but let's do something

00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:24,299
else let's translate our block so our

00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:28,410
block is on a lot o so we can edit it

00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:31,650
and let's do yeah let's do edits

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,930
and we have a tab here so it's the same

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,090
pattern even though this is not a node

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,000
we are not content type this is block

00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:43,470
but it's a custom block so its content

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,600
so that we can translate this now let's

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:51,420
add an English translation this time um

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:59,400
explore the world and then we put words

00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:00,990
in there and then we save it okay now

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,700
let's go back to our site and use the

00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,520
language switcher block and see if our

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,320
block translates okay so what are we in

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,970
right now we're in English we can look

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,890
at the URL and if we end our block and

00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:16,530
also has a problem with the title of the

00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:19,860
block because that's configuration but

00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:24,630
the content of the block is fine so if

00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:27,210
we switch to Spanish we can see the

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:35,880
content of the block translates nicely

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:37,980
right okay okay so now we're going to

00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,520
skip some things because we want to make

00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,520
these work

00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,830
okay I'm going to go down to the section

00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,010
which is enable configuration

00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,450
translation because that's so I'm doing

00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,870
things a little bit different order if

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:09,470
you are looking at the handout I'm at

00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:13,280
the bottom of pagina racing okay so

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,320
enable configuration translation and we

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,240
need to enable the module so we need to

00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,030
go to extend and this time we're going

00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:24,470
to look for configuration or translation

00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:30,190
either one of those is fine and we want

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:30,190
configuration translation yeah

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:50,400
super so now let's use our shortcuts and

00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:52,320
go back to our block layout so that's

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
managed structure block layout it's

00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:03,300
admin structure block and what we want

00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:06,030
to do is choose the block here so we

00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,600
have to find it it's in yeah explore on

00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:13,110
okay so will we do the drop down there

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,030
so we have a drop button here um and I

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,790
we can pick translate right from there

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,640
or you can pick configure and then

00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,380
there's a translate tab so you can see

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,220
here's configure and the translate tab

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,900
right so now now we can translate so

00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:33,210
Spanish was the original language um

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,310
let's look at it and see what it because

00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,410
I forget what we did okay yeah so the

00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:41,810
title is in Spanish so now let's go back

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:44,520
and add a translation for English and

00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:53,700
now let's make it say explore the world

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:56,340
and then we'll save that okay now let's

00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,250
go back to our site and use the language

00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,230
switcher block and see how it looks so

00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,260
we're looking at our block this is what

00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,210
we edited so we're in the default site

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,130
language right now I I can tell looking

00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,490
at the URL which is Spanish and the

00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:17,400
title and the content are fine let's

00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:21,060
switch to English and now we now the

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,580
title is also in English so this can be

00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,100
a little difficult at first because

00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:31,490
their difference between configuration

00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:39,750
and content and I don't know what to say

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:43,400
um you'll get used to it um yeah okay so

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:47,130
let's do the same thing for our pagina I

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,620
say el mismo so for about us let's

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,900
translate oh so here you can see because

00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,530
now we're switched to English right the

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,650
UI

00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:58,200
is in english now so anyway so let's do

00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:03,930
translate tab but you can switch back to

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:06,330
Spanish if you want um oh I remember

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:08,340
what we want what we want to do is we

00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,490
want to translate the menu link for this

00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,120
right if I come here I'm translating the

00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,120
content

00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:28,950
yeah I where is that yeah let's yeah I

00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:36,270
think it might be missing from my notes

00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:43,820
but let's go to structure menus and then

00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:48,560
um buscando para ah main navigation now

00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,560
espera um yeah let's look at the arrow

00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:55,260
ok and I think what we want to do is

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,860
actually we don't want to translate the

00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:06,360
menu we want to translate one link in

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:09,060
the menu so let's edit it first now we

00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,890
find out about us menu link and now

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,060
we're going to translate menu link it

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,760
doesn't do any good to translate the

00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,800
menu that the user typically never sees

00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,250
the name of the menu right we want to

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:25,680
translate the link so if we pick I think

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:32,120
the drop down next to about us oh why

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,120
does it say that hold on a second

00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:58,589
about us finally about us content menu

00:44:52,669 --> 00:45:03,179
menu link did we not make menus no hold

00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:14,339
on a second yeah okay let's let's try

00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:16,219
this again oh thank you okay um well no

00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:19,259
I think I think this might actually be

00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:21,179
hold on a second let's start again okay

00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:22,589
let's we'll just go start again because

00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,699
i found when my notes it's actually

00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:29,339
labeled skip but we're not skipping it

00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:31,380
so it's called skip translate menu links

00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:33,989
but we're going to actually do it and so

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:40,529
it's manage structure menus so let's go

00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:42,959
back manage structure menus okay now

00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:45,630
we're at admin structure menu we want to

00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:48,079
find the main navigation menu and what

00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:54,319
we're going to click is the context menu

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:58,189
for edit menu yeah so let's do edit menu

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:04,979
you might have been right but I got lost

00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:07,459
okay hold on okay so um now we want to

00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:12,559
find the about Us link which we did and

00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:12,559
in the context menu should be translate

00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:22,289
okay click on edit yeah I think maybe we

00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:29,400
didn't save it um well the module is

00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:31,949
installed so no so let's go back to our

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,319
if I we look at our shortcuts let's go

00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:40,380
back to the language configuration page

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:45,390
in the ulema they'll ah so let's go to

00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:47,630
let's find the menu section there we go

00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,630
okay

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,030
excellent now we can do it now we all

00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:09,200
know right so we go here and menus I

00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:12,020
think it's in structure menus yeah good

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:19,820
and then now translate is a drop down

00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:21,620
next to about us ok and then let's uh so

00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,950
this was originally created in English

00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:26,480
so our menu link is always about us when

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:33,710
we want to do is add a spanish

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:39,830
translation acerca de and then we can

00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:45,260
save this and let's go back to the

00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:47,840
homepage ok so now we want to see if the

00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,660
menu link because remember before the

00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,090
content translated ok because we had

00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:56,750
content translation on the difference is

00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:59,540
now we turn on config translation so

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,580
let's switch to Spanish and we're

00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,490
looking here at the menu and now the

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:07,550
menu is in Spanish ok so it's a little

00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:10,070
complicated but it totally works alright

00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:13,100
so what we've talked about was how to

00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:17,480
add languages we talked about content

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:20,540
translation um we've done some

00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:24,110
configuration translation in terms of

00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:28,160
the block title and the menu title let's

00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:30,530
do one more um configuration translation

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,390
let's translate the site name so

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,610
sitename setting is managed

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:38,930
configuration system system information

00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:44,510
so its administration configuration she

00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:49,480
stammered informacion del sitio okay

00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:52,220
amana at the top we have a translate 10

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,590
okay so what have we got a Spanish was

00:48:52,220 --> 00:49:02,040
the original so let's add a translation

00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:04,500
in English so here look um so

00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,680
haven't what's really nice here is we

00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,140
don't have to remember what it was in

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:16,610
the other language it's telling us that

00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:20,420
in Spanish it was explore okay alright

00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:26,180
so let's translate that to English as

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:29,630
explore so let's let's save this and

00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:33,710
then let's edit our Spanish original and

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:40,010
let's change this to Spanish explode on

00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:42,870
ok and then let's save this so the

00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:45,150
configuration UI is very similar to the

00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:47,430
content you I so we are trying to make

00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:52,200
things a little less confusing so we

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:54,150
have a um tabs and the configuration

00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,820
translation screen is really nice

00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,710
because it shows you the original that

00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:02,940
you're translating from and what you're

00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:04,920
translating into at the same time um ok

00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,760
so now let's go back to the site and see

00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,770
if our site name changes so now we're in

00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,680
Spanish the default language and it says

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:22,200
xplode on and if we come behind grace

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:24,540
and the site name is explore our maybe

00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:29,340
that's because it was the same and not

00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:33,740
different let's try it again yeah system

00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:36,360
site information let's try to translate

00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,370
English ah because we were Trent the it

00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:42,770
was the same originally it didn't

00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:47,760
actually save it as a translation so um

00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:49,470
yeah okay so now what site name is

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,950
explore when we look at it in English

00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:54,950
and it's exploded in espanol okay

00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:02,040
so we're actually doing really good on

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,570
time so I we're going to be able to do

00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,700
all the things I wanted to which is

00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,310
great so we have one more thing I want

00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,880
to show you which is the user interface

00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:14,099
for the admin UI string translations and

00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,820
one of the cool things that you can do

00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:21,260
with this is translate English so you

00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:24,150
can change the default strings in the UI

00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:31,109
without any special modules this is

00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:33,840
really great so this section is and so

00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:39,020
let's see where am I I'm mana Paulina

00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:43,410
dulce in the center and the heading is

00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:46,170
interact enable interface translation so

00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:48,470
this is in the handout where I am and

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,180
what we want we already have the

00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,310
interface translation module turned on

00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,440
because we installed in a language

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,300
different than English if you had

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,980
installed in English you would have to

00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,369
enable the module but we installed in

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,950
Spanish so it did that for us already so

00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,960
what we want to do now is go to the

00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:09,150
administration page for this so that's

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,910
in manage configuration regional

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:16,920
languages but this time user interface

00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:23,000
translation traducción de la interfaz de

00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:26,760
los audio ok it's Tom Ian now this um

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,490
this UI is really nice also we've done

00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:33,869
some improvements here so we can search

00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:37,560
for content so let's change sign let's

00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:40,260
change log in and log out to sign-in and

00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,869
sign-out oh I remember what we need to

00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,609
do but before we do that we have to tell

00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:50,040
it that we want to translate English so

00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:52,500
that's we do we have to override English

00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,750
so I'm on the next page in the notes now

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,710
and overriding English make English

00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:01,200
translatable so we do this on the

00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:05,760
idiomas pagina I think that might be in

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,540
our shortcuts but it's also right there

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:13,849
too

00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:15,619
great so the way we talat that we want

00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:22,310
english to be translated as we first we

00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:26,119
edit english yakky we can tell it that

00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:28,730
we want to be able to I'm not sure what

translation to English hability Todd

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,119
ability thought okay so now we've told

00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,970
that we want to be able to translate

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:48,590
English let's go back to the user

00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:52,660
interface translation page yeah

00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:56,930

our idioma and for the content what we

00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:08,060
want to search above that is let's

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,380
search for a log LG and filter and then

00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:15,920
we scroll down a little bit and

00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:22,790
something here will say log in hold on

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:25,790
let me check my example oh yeah capitals

00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:28,730
matter so let's just capital L OG but no

00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:36,320
in let's let's just do the log with no

00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:38,599
in and then filter otra vez aha okay so

00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,510
now we've seen the strings that match

00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:46,099
capital l OG and instead of logging

00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:52,070
let's say sign in and instead of log out

00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:55,160
we can say sign out yeah uno momento now

00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:58,820
that you are working on this model I

00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:02,630
think that option of capital letters

00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:05,119
lower levels that must be configurable

00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:10,130
maybe a checkbook that I can see to find

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:13,310
all the options it simply linnea for the

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:17,510
and para buscar solamente para buscar

00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:19,940
pero las palabras exact dose then it

00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,780
matters right yes but when you're

00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,550
searching

00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,560
maybe it would be helpful to be case

00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,450
insensitive or have an option for it to

00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:30,080
be case insensitive and I don't think we

00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:33,170
have an issue for that so if you if you

00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:36,590
could create the issue and then and then

00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:38,450
send a link that would be great okay so

00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:41,090
go ahead and save these and then let's

00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:43,570
look at the site and what we should

00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:47,900
we'll see because we have a logout menu

00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:50,030
in English so we switch to English and

00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:53,120
then instead of log out it says sign out

00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:56,750
this makes it really easy to change

00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,420
those default strings and also because

00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:04,750
English is not the same everywhere right

00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,750
so this is very helpful for that Tom Ian

00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:14,800
okay so um let's switch back to the

00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,800
presentation

00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,310
maybe play

00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:39,549
okay all right great um now um you had

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,039
you had a question earlier about

00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:44,740
translating content and whether or not

00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:48,750
drupal would do that for you there are

00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:52,000
some contributed modules which hook into

00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:55,510
translation services and there's also

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,359
contributed modules to make an internal

00:56:55,510 --> 00:57:02,710
workflow which you can use for handling

00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:06,280
revisions and reviewing translations and

00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:08,650
things like that but it's too much to go

00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:18,789
into all that right now but there is

00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:20,770
some support for that in contribs if you

00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:25,289
saw the keynote and they mentioned that

00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:29,079
we have tour in core and it gives in

00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:32,589
context help pointing at things on the

00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,329
pages and we have issues open for multi

00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:37,420
for improving or multilingual a

00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:40,690
documentation in tour and also otherwise

00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:44,260
um in handbook pages and things like

00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:47,559
that we also need help people to just

00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:49,720
try Drupal 8 and help us find the bugs

00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:51,940
so we're sure we know about them because

00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,789
we need to know about them now we need

00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:57,130
to evaluate if they are minor normal

00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:59,109
major or critical because we need to

00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:01,569
make sure we know of all the criticals

00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:05,170
so we know where we can concentrate our

00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:06,609
efforts so we can get 80 released and if

00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,789
we have a hidden critical because

00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:11,650
nobody's tried it we find it later it's

00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:13,420
going to slow the release down it will

00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:16,539
actually help us release faster if we

00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:19,779
can find the critical sooner so you know

00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:22,150
start using it don't worry about you

00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:26,859
know writing code and stuff just finding

00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:30,970
problems can really be helpful um there

00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:34,000
is some difficulties uh what we relied

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:36,430
on here was always the language fall

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,440
back in the URL but there are other

00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,880
choices for how you decide your fallback

00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,809
so that gets a little bit more

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,809
complicated to

00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:51,339
okay so um Kristin worked on this demo a

00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:56,049
lot it's based in part on the the drupal

00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:58,209
demo framework um and um I really

00:58:56,049 --> 00:59:01,539
encourage you to try it yourself if you

00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:03,400
started the demo frame install and

00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:05,799
simply test me it's probably done by now

00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,309
so you can go and play with your own

00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:10,989
built Drupal 8 multilingual site and try

00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:14,369
translating things and look at the

00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:18,579
settings and turn things on and off um I

00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:20,890
we have a great hub for our team that

00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:23,999
works on Drupal 8 it's Drupal 8

00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,469
multilingual org and you can find

00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:29,229
updates when we write multilingual bog

00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:32,200
posts we have tweets there about

00:59:29,229 --> 00:59:34,329
multilingual we have upcoming places

00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,789
that we're making presentations and we

00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:40,630
also have a really great format for

00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:43,239
helping you find issues to work on so we

00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,759
finding issues can be difficult so we

00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:51,519
try and help you do that there also um

00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:54,459
and gob oars website is excellent and he

00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,469
has multilingual tidbits which tell you

00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:57,969
all about like changes in Drupal 8 and

00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,920
all the great things that we've been

00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:06,039
working on and a little bit about what's

00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:08,069
left to do so that's an h oj t s yhu and

01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:14,339
you can go there and find all kinds of

01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:17,499
multilingual information okay so um

01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:21,430
we're only three minutes over that's

01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:24,190
great um we have a little break right

01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:27,509
now so I can I will stay here and answer

01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:32,469
questions for you but also remember on

01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:35,440
the 215 if you look for the mentor table

01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:38,650
with the tall green sign we can just

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,630
meet at a table near there and answer

01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:44,619
any questions you have or help get your

01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:46,329
demo working or anything anything like

01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:50,130
that oh I remember I have one more

01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:53,349
announcement and that is that on

01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,420
multilingual has its team meetings in

01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:58,240
IRC

01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:01,480
who knows how to get in IRC for drupal

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:07,119
channels right this is the place to be I

01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:09,040
know IRC is very 1995 or whatever but we

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,950
use it and that's where all the people

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,230
are talking it's especially important

01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:16,540
for our multilingual team meetings that

01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:19,359
we talk in a place where we write our

01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,339
words down because not everybody speaks

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:24,609
English is their first language and if

01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:27,010
you are on a hangout or a call you it's

01:01:24,609 --> 01:01:29,200
it's so hard to understand if people are

01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:32,140
not speaking in your language but when

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,059
we type our meetings people can copy and

01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,130
paste and translate something if they

01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:37,960
don't know what it says they can think

01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:40,180
of what they want to say and use google

01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,720
translate translate into English you can

01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:45,609
also just um read something maybe a

01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,530
couple of times you can read something

01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:49,630
somebody said and then read it again and

01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:52,030
you know you never have to say could you

01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,730
say that again slower right because it's

01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:58,089
all written down so I really encourage

01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:01,030
you to get an IRC client if you have a

01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:03,579
Mac lime chat is really great and if you

01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:06,880
have a Windows machine or Linux hex chat

01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:09,130
is good pigeon is also good for windows

01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,380
and the channels that are important our

01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:16,450
pound Drupal I'm sorry hash Drupal a

01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,970
hash triple dash contribute is where we

01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:20,410
talk about making Drupal better and you

01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:22,869
can go there there's no special

01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:27,160
permission you are welcome there for

01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:33,520

01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:36,819
8m I de OCHA ma e Drupal 8 multilingual

01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:39,880
initiative and today there is a

01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:42,430
multilingual team meeting I don't know

01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:45,490
exactly what time because I'm off a

01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:48,790
little bit it might be right now i'm not

01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:51,339
sure but if you look for a tweet from

01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:54,490
Gabor also he tweeted about when the

01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:58,270
meeting is so if you want to make your

01:02:54,490 --> 01:03:00,069
issue and join IRC you can put a link to

01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:02,500
the issue you created and during the

01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:04,630
team meeting we can talk about it and

01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,690
say oh yes we have an issue for that

01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:08,410
let's mark it duplicate or oh no you

with this other one so people can find

01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,670
it so we really like to talk to each

01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:19,930
other and support each other and the

01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:23,500
meetings are really great so to 15 for
