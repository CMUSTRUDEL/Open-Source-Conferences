Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Drupal 8 multilingual hands-on
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: YesCT

Over a thousand people participated in the issues around improving multilingual features and APIs in Drupal 8 for the past three years. There are around a thousand issues, most of which are resolved in this initiative as of this submission making Drupal 8 a truly outstanding release for everybody looking to create even single language non-English sites but especially those making multilingual sites. Although there will surely be contributed modules useful to round out multilingual sites in Drupal 8, there is support for way more than there was in Drupal 7 core and even if you add in all available contributed modules - and with less code and more unified approaches.

This lab aims to provide a hands-on way showing you around all the great improvements and gives tips as to how to best utilize the new solutions. We will also talk about where contributed modules will still be needed.

The ideal attendee at this session has some experience in Drupal 6 or 7 foreign language and/or multilingual site building, however those who have no experience in foreign/multilingual site building will also get a lot out of it.

We will continue in the big exhibit hall room at 2:15, near the mentor table.
