Hello, everybody. First of all, thanks for joining us.

00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:18,139
Here we're going to tell you something about our history and how we're building one DrupalShop

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,040
in Brazil. The title is "How to build a Drupal Shop with

00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,040
no money but with lots of desire." I'm Fred.

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,530
I'm Taller manager and partner and co-founder with Rafael.

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,070
I have 20 years of experience in business and graduated in strategic marketing.

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,000
-Hello, everybody. I am Rafael Carceres.

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,140
I am a Taller managing partner too. I have 15 years of experience in web projects

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,160
and I graduated in computer science. Fred and I started Taller with two other partners

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:14,690
in the beginning, Sebastian Ferrari, who is doing a presentation right now, and Vinicius

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,240
Freitas, who is in the United States right now.

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:29,320
This is our first presentation in English, and sorry if you don't understand something.

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:41,180
You can ask. Feel free to do that. First of all, this guy was our inspiration.

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:51,150
His name is Guy Kawasaki. This book, "The Art of the Start," was our big

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,780
inspiration in the beginning. We read this book and we re-read a lot, and

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:10,260
we tried to apply all this knowledge. He was on a team from Apple in 1984.

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:22,079
Today he is a venture capitalist and writes. He has a lot of books, awesome books.

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:31,880
First of all, our advice is learn how to provide valuable services, how to sell, how to manage

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,819
your finances. The best way to start that is as a freelancer.

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:46,420
This will give you the basic business experience to help you figure out if getting a business

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,000
is what you really want. -Yeah, but if you cannot be a freelancer,

00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,980
it is good for you to be working with big companies. If not working in companies, in the market

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,000
area or commercial area, and you're going to get a lot of experience, and you can put

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,240
this in your startup. -This is our island where we live. It looks

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:34,130
like Silicon Valley in Brazil. There is a growing scenario of technology,

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:43,589
and it's a beautiful place to visit, and everybody's invited already to come.

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:59,520
We started really, really small in the room of my house, and with a lot of desire, with

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,780
no money, and we believed a lot in our dreams. That's why we are talking about this.

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,799
Sebastian, the other partner, lives in San Paulo and we started the company, me and Rafael,

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,799
in Florianopolis, Sebastian in San Paulo, Vinny living in the USA.

00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:28,809
-In the beginning we were all home offices and we started in our garage.

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,009
It's a really good way to start. You don't have to spend a lot of money and

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,610
rent big offices. You can start small.

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,050
You often won't have all the tools, time, and people you think you need.

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:54,370
It's important to learn to always try your best with what you have.

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,800
So we rented this house in Florianopolis, some guys here know, Nicky.

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,379
In the beginning we had six, seven people in a big house, and we lived in the house

00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:19,379
just to save money for about one year, and we split the rent with the company.

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,540
It's that. That's the beginning, just a few people.

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:35,729
Now we moved to a bigger place and now we have 28 people working with us.

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:43,729
We made a lot of mistakes. We learned a lot of what not to do.

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,729
We also have done some great things. This presentation is a mix of our services

00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:01,620
in our fields until today. -Cool. So if you want to be an entrepreneur, money

00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:08,939
is not the "why." If you want to get money really fast, startup

00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:17,899
is not the best way to start some company. If you believe in your dreams, you need to

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:25,919
be an entrepreneur and be part of it. If you just want to be a boss, a startup

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,580
is not the best choice. A startup is hard. It's not really easy to

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,580
start, and you must believe in yourself and your team and everybody.

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:46,939
This guy is Simon Sinek. He wrote a book and gave a classic presentation in TED Talks.

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,419
You can search it after. It is a presentation is about what he calls

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,439
the golden circle. He says people don't buy what you do. People

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,349
buy why you do. Taller started with why. This is our why.

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:12,349
Get together a group of committed and talented people with common purposes who want to improve

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,949
the world, innovation, developing people, and encouraging creativity freely.

00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:26,529
This is why we started the company at first. We seized the opportunity.

00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,379
In the beginning, there were few other Drupal Shops in Brazil.

00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:39,379
At the time, none of them were Agile. None of them had a startup culture.

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:50,000
We wanted to try that, a Drupal Shop with startup culture and work with Agile methods.

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,550
-Now we're going to start to talk about some methods and what we think is good, so let's

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,990
talk about Blue Ocean. It's good if you have a vision and to make

00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,969
your strategy. To find the right time, we must be alert.

00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,559
Focus always on how to offer out of the comfort zone.

00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:23,899
You need to be really, really attentive in the market, in the opportunities, and probably

00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:30,899
you will find something to put your money or put your energy to start something.

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,079
-You have to create a cultured market space by constructing the marketing boundaries.

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:43,839
You have to focus on the big picture, reaching beyond the existing demand.

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,839
You have to find why there is a demand and generate new values.

00:08:52,199 --> 00:09:01,619
Get this strategic sequence right. You have to do this to eliminate the competitors.

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,690
The second thing you have to create is a vision. You have to believe in your vision.

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,879
You have to work hard and you will reach it. You can do this.

00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,779
-In the vision, the vision needs to have an expiration date.

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,259
You need to have a due. You need to have a due date to do something.

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:34,719
Our vision was to become a reference company in high-quality Drupal development in Brazil

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:46,190
by 2015, so we are one of them. One of the most important things, carefully

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,209
choose your partners. It's really, really serious.

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,029
-You have to find reliable people with complimentary skills.

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:03,029
You have to find what you aren't good at and associate with people who are.

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,730
For example, if you are a tech person, you need to find a business person.

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,600
If you are a business person, you have to find a geek.

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,520
You have to do this to balance the company. It's the best way to start, because if you are

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,560
alone it's really, really hard to do something. With partners, everything is easier.

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:39,200
It has some problems too, but is easier because the war is easier to start.

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,620
-Participate in the community. It's the most important thing, and we are talking here about

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,540
Drupal, but not just the Drupal community. We have a lot of communities that we can participate

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,680
in, like startups and Agile methods and other technologies.

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,500
It's a good way to get involved with people with the same interests. Find business partners.

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,470
Find customers. Find contributors. You have to contribute with code, with documentation,

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:19,970
with support, and this will help you to find people to work with you.

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
That's very important too, business model canvas.

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,089
Define your business model. We used that too in the beginning of the journey.

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:41,769
It helped us a lot to understand our challenges and to get the big pictures of business quickly.

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:47,689
It's a very nice tool because you must put the most important thing, what you want to start

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:56,029
or what you believe, and it is easier to check this out and make your decisions faster.

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,819
This will help you to get the big picture, so it's really important.

00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:08,639
We have to find our customer segments, to find our values, propositions, what we are offering

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,749
to our clients, to our customers, and how will we communicate with them?

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:17,980
How will we spend the money? How will we get the money?

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,980
What solution do we want to solve? I recommend you to find, and if you want to

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,110
start a business, it's a really, really, really important thing to do.

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,939
The words are almost the same, but a little bit new in comparison with the business

00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:41,459
model canvas. You can search in Google with "lean canvas."

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:51,219
It's kind of the same, but a little bit different. -[inaudible] you can give an example.

00:12:51,610 --> 00:13:05,190
-Okay, first... This is easier. In the beginning we had to find our customer segments.

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:14,859
For example, agencies, government, other tech companies who want to do Drupal but don't

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,160
know how, these kind of things. Your value proposition was to bring quality

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,160
software to this company, not just quality software, products, working with the whole

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:36,689
product by itself. Usually tech companies don't care about design

00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:43,689
and other things, and we really care, so it's a value that we want to share with our customers.

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,720
What were our channels? Like events, Drupal camps, and other events,

00:13:53,319 --> 00:14:00,319
our blog, forums, and etc.

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,199
Here, for example, we have our cost structure.

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:15,699
In the beginning, no cost structure. Just living in Fred's living room and each of us

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,110
in our rooms so we can not spend money helped us.

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:29,970
The revenue streams, for example, outsourcing software, training, consulting, mentoring,

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:37,230
like those things. When we put all these things in this canvas,

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:51,679
you can see the big picture of our business without doing a 

00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:58,439
lot of documenting. You do this quickly, and you have the x-ray

00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,119
of your company.

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,380
-Focus on value to execute fast. It's important.

00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:17,649
Value is when your client realizes that he's getting more while spending less with you.

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,730
Expensive or cheap is a simple perception of value.

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:38,110
This is our value. You want to execute fast and you want to do things fast to bring to

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:47,900
our customers time to market mostly. These other things are really important. This

00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:55,189
is from the book, "The Art of Start." If you want to create a company, you have

00:15:55,189 --> 00:16:02,189
to do at least one of these four things. One, make the world a better place.

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,410
Increase the quality of life. Right a terrible wrong.

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:14,329
Prevent the ending of something good. We make the world a better place is the thing

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:24,789
we mostly try to do, and we do this by creating an environment so that people can be themselves

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:36,860
and can try to help us in the decisions, and we are a reasonable company, so people can

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:50,140
really work without concerns. -Begin by providing service.

00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:57,629
Products take time and money to be developed. With our service you can make money in the

00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,639
next day. It's easier with service.

00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:08,470
We start providing service thinking about one day we start to build our product.

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:14,289
We try to be profitable, to invest in our product development.

00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:19,630
That's what we have to say right now. It's easier if you start doing service for the

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,480
other companies, but if you want to change the world in some way, if you have some product

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,480
to do this, it's easier and better if you are doing service.

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,110
Here's Lean Startup, what we really believe, and we follow these rules.

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,510
Since the beginning, we've applied ideas and concepts from the Lean Startup.

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,260
We are providing development service to our clients.

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:56,260
We believe that avoids ways that the organization helps us reach profitability,

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:03,549
enable us to invest talent, people that make a great team.

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:11,169
-The biggest way is to make something that no one wants.

00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:19,349
A lot of people try to do something great, and when you bring it to your customers, no

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:29,200
one wants it. We try to find this valuable work that we

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:37,570
do, and working with Drupal and making sites, making portals, little portals, little

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,770
sites, getting projects with whole interface design.

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:49,890
It's what I was trying to talk about earlier, that how often we are working with Drupal,

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,309
we get some projects with the whole interface design done up front.

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,940
When we try, we start to build this design change during this execution process, always.

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:09,940
So we try to tell our clients to start small, and we want to work with the designers and

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:17,580
talk to the designers so we don't have this waste.

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:26,490
We try to be Agile and Lean in the other aspects of our company, so we have a greater chance

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,610
of success doing this because we don't have so much waste.

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:38,500
-Don't manage people. Manage the system. It's really important in our startup.

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:47,000
-This is the Agile Manifesto. The Agile Manifesto says individuals and interactions

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:53,130
over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation.

00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,130
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan.

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,360
Process and tools in Agile companies are really, really important, but not more important than

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
people. People just take the process and tools, not

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,940
the tools dictating how people should work. It's really important.

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,820
-Yeah, we believe that because it's easier if you are transparent with your client,

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:36,980
you don't need to make a contract to make a security if something goes wrong.

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:46,970
If you have a relationship with them like you do with your friends, the clients come

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,280
close to you and everything goes easy.

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,980
-This is Management 3.0. Rafa from Just Digital has a

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
great video about Management 3.0, and I don't know if you have subtitles yet, but it's a

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,740
really good place to find something. -We applied that concept in the beginning in

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:26,880
our company before we even knew this term. This term is really new, and we seek to spread

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,799
this concept in the company. It's very important. We try to put this in

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,519
commercials, in the commercial areas, in the marketing areas.

00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,919
It's not easy, and we made a lot of mistakes, often by assuming many responsibilities.

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,480
Making mistakes is good. You learn fast, and you can change. You can move forward.

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,040
-And we made a lot of mistakes in the beginning. For example, to please one of the customers,

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:10,460
we tried to find freelancers and get the project anyway, and we tried to embrace more than

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,309
our capacity always. This is a great waste.

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:25,169
The freelancers have left us now, who were in the project from the beginning.

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:32,470
After that, the project was a downward spiral until the project failed.

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:38,769
We lost money and we lost the customer. We didn't look good.

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:45,090
This is important because what Fred told us is true.

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:52,850
It's no problem to make a mistake. You have to learn from these mistakes and

00:22:53,059 --> 00:23:00,999
move forward. -Because of that, embrace your constraints.

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:10,750
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. This is true because you have a lot of strong

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:20,500
people. If you have a lot of people who don't have the same capacity as everybody, you need to

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,600
stop and help them to come with us. It's easier for moving forward fast, and it's

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,090
our responsibility. -You have to find this weakest link and try

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,539
to fix it. This means that there will always be a weak link within

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:45,340
the organization that will affect the whole company performance.

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,750
So you have to find this and fix it. Find another, and fix it.

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,960
This book, "The Goal," describes the theory of constraints.

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,679
It talks about the constraints and restrictions that you have.

00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,019
So that's another reference.

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,960
-A system with more than 80% of your capacity

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,490
tends to have an endless queue. It's kind of like this in our city in the summer.

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,179
Our city has no more than 600 people. On normal days in the summer, we have more than two

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:32,830
million, and this happens every day. It's like a car queue, like you see here.

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,830
When it is full, 100% capacity, all the cars stop everything and everywhere.

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:50,440
-If one car broke, all the cars will be crazy. If you have a freeway where two cars are broken

00:24:50,760 --> 00:25:02,720
or have some problems, we will be slower, but we don't stop.

00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:16,399
We have a continuous flow always. Chaos theory is about not trying to see the

00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:21,190
future, to prevent the future. A system problem can affect an unimaginable

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:28,970
pace, so do not plan for long periods. Have a purpose and goals, but don't try to

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:36,370
make detailed plans. It is a waste. When long-shots are made, they end up reflecting

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,880
more of a fantasy. Our whole planet is reality, so we don't try to plan for six months to

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,409
one year. It's a waste because the chaos theory says.

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:56,789
-Design and thinking. Think like a designer. It's a great tip as

00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,350
well. Turn a problem into solutions.

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:10,110
You can move a way of seeing something. Explore new ways to do old things.

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:19,510
Like we say in Brazil, move out of your square. Try to understand the client and his real

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,820
needs. Scratching your own itch.

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,470
It's very important. Create something that you are moved by.

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,529
The process that we're building, it's kind of this.

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:41,539
We have some problem, and so if we have some problem, other people and other companies

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,960
have the same problem or some problem similar with that.

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:55,660
So scratch your own itch. Automate services. Try to create products

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,380
with better efficiency and improve something that you don't like.

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:10,240
It's a great way to create something valuable. This guy is Steve Blank. He created

00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:17,419
something and named it Customer Development. It's based off the Lean Startup projects.

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,860
We don't want to create products. We want to create customers.

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,320
We have to find customers and validate these customers, and if you don't find these customers,

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,929
you have to evolve and try out other hypotheses until you find this customer.

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:41,659
When you find this customer, you have to create this customer, and after that you have to

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,159
build the company. This is an important thing.

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:54,939
You have to search and after you execute. -Create something that you would buy.

00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:01,779
Try to make something you think you cannot. Try. You can make a mistake, no worries, and

00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,940
you learn about that. The final step is goals for yourself.

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:14,840
I read something last week about Mark. He tried to set some big goals, and that's

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,970
one good way to prove to yourself that you can do something that you think you cannot

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,039
do. You can talk with your friends.

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:32,899
You can talk with lots of people, so you're going to put all of your energy to reach these

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,029
goals. On thing that is really nice to say is think

00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,610
big. Don't be afraid about that.

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,659
Try to make something you think you cannot, like I said.

00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:52,659
It's hard, but it's good. -Why metrics matter.

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,070
Creating metrics and measuring them can be your biggest challenge.

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,639
We are trying, but it's not so easy, but we are constantly trying to improve our metrics.

00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:10,220
We'll never stop seeking this excellence because we know that's the only way to find something

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:17,120
good. You have to measure and to see if you are

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,759
evolving or not. It's really important.

00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:29,819
The metric is not really easy to start to do in your company.

00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:39,599
It's one of our challenges in our company, so we need to keep moving.

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,090
Milestones. Milestones are really important too.

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,500
Keep setting important dates. We spoke before about that.

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,200
If you have some due date to do something, you'll be more involved with that, and you'll

00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,200
try to reach that goal. Set deadlines, measure the results, and

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,440
create a committed and developed resilience. Resilience is a very important word.

00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:15,330
Try to continuously measure development. You have to give your customers value.

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:21,940
How are you perceived by your clients? Search this information.

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,460
They are valuable too. What your clients tell about you changes the

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,429
way you think about your business. You have to listen to her, to him.

00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:42,640
-One of the things that we do a lot in our company is retrospectives.

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:47,380
Sometimes some clients can think this is a waste of time, but it is not a waste of time.

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,440
It's very important. In that moment, you can talk about mistakes,

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,509
you can talk about new goals, and you can improve your team and yourself.

00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:03,539
The most important is to remember you are not looking to blame. You are looking to a

00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,039
process. "Why did something happen in this way?" is

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,870
a good question to do. "Why don't we realize that?"

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:18,870
"What could make us work faster?" The decision is the people as a team, take

00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:26,169
responsibility for the process and result, find a solution in the same way.

00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:33,889
That's really, really important, and if you can show that important stuff to your client,

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:40,360
everything can be good in your relationship with them.

00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,500
-One thing about retrospectives is we try to make retrospectives with our clients and with

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,500
our team. We try to ask some questions.

00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:00,690
What are we doing wrong? What are we doing right too?

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,450
What do we need to start to do? The questions that change everything.

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,210
With these questions, you can improve continuously. Do not be afraid to change.

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,259
This is a good thing, change. You have to change every day.

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:26,279
-So look out of your comfort zone. It's important. If you can improve 1% every day, you're going

00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:33,279
to be 365% in one year. Make a change trying to take the most of your

00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:46,349
reserves. Feedbacks 360. It's good to improve relationships

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:53,120
in your company, in your startup, and we try to do this every six months.

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,490
This is getting better, the relationship with everybody, and you know what you need to improve

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:06,490
yourself, and you help your friends and your colleagues and your team to improve too.

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:16,370
-Know your team's frustrations and help them to improve is what the feedback is doing.

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:23,370
They should have an open channel to speak and suggest without being judged.

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,600
Listen to your customer's problems, make him your friend, what I told you before.

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,600
It's going to easier, your relationship with them.

00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:50,799
Make him a friend of yours. Talk to him on a day-to-day basis.

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,149
Listen to his pain. You can help him, and he can help you.

00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:01,799
It doesn't have to be formal always. We listen to our customers periodically and

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:08,799
retrospectives when we ask how we can improve, what we have to keep and, what we need to

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:14,790
start doing, like Rafa said before.

00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:32,740
-I was going to ask you. You have a lot of communications, a lot of marketing. You guys are developers, right?

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
-Sorry?

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,340
-You guys are developers? -I am the developer.

00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,380
-And I am the marketer.

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,380
-You are the business person?

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:53,420
I was wondering how you spend your time. I see a lot of marketing. How do you spend your time?

00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:02,360
How do you manage that? [inaudible] -It's not easy.

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,520
-How do you plan? Just the day-to-day, deliver, deliver, deliver. 

00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:21,540
To what extent, your manifesto, for example, has really been true to what you do?

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,560
-It's a little bit easier because we have 28 people. In the beginning, we had five.

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:37,640
But now we try to... Rafa is a partner as well, but he's not available all the time to help us with our team. 

00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:46,520
You need to improve your team. We have no bosses.

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:56,240
Everything that we do is not like... I never tell you what you need to do. You tell me what you can do.

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:09,880
It's easier to do what you want to do or what you can do. Everybody has a voice in the company, and everybody helps us to do that.

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,620
That's a little bit of how we split the communication.

00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,490
Today I'm just a developer in the strategic and innovation projects.

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,780
For example, last year I developed a bio application

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:37,940
with the NFC and a lot of new stuff, so this kind of...

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:59,060
-[Spanish]

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:09,240
-This is the way we talk to our clients on a day-to-day basis. We always make sure he knows what's happening in the project everyday.

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,110
-Yeah, it's important. We have some clients who are different from the other ones, and

00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,600
follow up is very important. If something is going wrong in the future,

00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,370
you have everything in the documentation, and you can show them.

00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:29,370
If you have a good relationship with your client, you can do follow ups weekly, and if

00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:36,990
the relationship is a little bit tense, you must be every day.

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:50,180
It's security for your company, if he asks you something that is not true.

00:37:50,220 --> 00:38:00,920
-It is important to build confidence when this scales to the boss of the boss of the boss, it is important.

00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,570
Empower the people. Autonomous teams, motivate them with a line

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:13,440
and vision. Bad work will go far away.

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:23,180
People want to feel part of the whole. We think and believe this has real value to us,

00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,580
to all of us. We have to solve this problem faster.

00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,840
It's really important in our company that people have power.

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,560
The developers, the designers, everybody has power to change everything, to make decisions

00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:46,390
without asking us all the time. It's really important because if you want

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,330
to control everything, you will be working 24 hours a day.

00:38:51,330 --> 00:39:01,190
We have to split this with all the people. Participate in events.

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Doing lectures, like us and our first lecture in a big event like that, is a great way to

00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,730
meet the top heads of Drupal or the other communities.

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:21,730
It's not really easy, as you can see, but you must try.

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,890
Support social ideas to improve your local community.

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,690
We do it a lot in Brazil. We have a lot of community, not just Drupal.

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:37,120
We need to be involved with that, and you can find other opportunities, other people.

00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,760
Maybe you can find some talent over there to bring to your company.

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,760
It's really important too. -And help to get toward a better place.

00:39:49,760 --> 00:40:00,180
The last thing we did is map your culture. This is one thing we took from Zappos.

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,960
This is really important because, first of all, culture is not something you create for

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,960
nothing. You have to do some work. It takes a while for your company to have

00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:20,080
a culture and your trajectory and service, insight to others, so mapping your culture is really important.

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Facilitate the understanding of applying culture to anyone who will be part of the

00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:37,730
company, so if you have a mapped culture, everybody who wants to join us will know what

00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:44,580
they have to expect and how we behave and how Taller works, for example.

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:50,180
-You can start to do like this with building one mantra.

00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:58,580
A mantra is like one phrase or one word or two or three to tell to all your employees

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:04,930
what you want to do, where you are going to go, and you understand everything and they

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:11,930
will come with you. It's really important to keep the team strong.

00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,940
Here's almost the last one. To infinity and beyond.

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:26,660
The holacracy, what I have told you guys about Zappos. A holacracy is a kind of

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:40,950
democracy, but it's not really a democracy. I will try to explain.

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:49,780
If everybody wants to do something here, we make a meeting, and if someone has one idea

00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:56,310
and says to everybody... If you have a consensus of everybody, the decision is made already.

00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:01,960
It's an easy way, but it's not easy to apply in your company.

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:17,220
We're trying to do that in this moment. -A holacracy is important because we don't have bosses.

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:26,450
We own the company, but we are not bosses, so the people have to do something so that

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,230
things will happen. Another thing we are starting to improve is

00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:42,450
our digital marketing, trying to write more and write books and do something.

00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,500
The last thing is coffee Kaizen. Coffee Kaizen is a way to find root cause

00:42:50,590 --> 00:43:00,430
analysis with your clients, so when things are really bad, and sometimes things go wrong,

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,660
we try to meet with our clients in a room with a lot of [inaudible] and try to find

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,960
the root cause of every problem in the process, and we try to fix this with him.

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:26,840
So guys, that's the last slide. We are what we do and what we share.

00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,140
If you have some questions, we can answer again.

00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:38,900
Sorry about the English, again. When we applied to the conference, we didn't

00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:45,140
know that Portuguese would not be allowed, so we are really trying. It really challenges

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:52,140
us, so sorry again. -Yeah, guys. Thank you.

00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:08,230
-[Portuguese] -Great presentation.

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Since you tried so hard in English, I'll try to ask my question in Spanish.

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:38,860
[Spanish]

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:47,050
-I can speak English. You ask us 

00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:55,110
if we have goals to reach. That's the question?

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,120
-Ask the question in English.

00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:18,820
-The earlier slide on the capacity with the traffic, right? So my question is to object

00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:26,060
the best flow, like the load on a server, you want the best flow so there's no line,

00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:33,050
nobody's waiting in line, so how do you achieve that? How have you found to achieve that in

00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:41,350
your business? -First thing, we try to do what we call a

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:49,580
one test flow, so we have a team, and all the team works in one story for the time.

00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:56,750
We don't have this decrease. If one developer is having problems, we do

00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,760
what we call "stop the line." We stop the line. Toyota is doing that with [inaudible]

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:16,020
We stop the line, and all the other developers go to this developer and help him to fix this

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:25,210
obstruction, this queue. This guarantees to us that no one says, "This

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,180
is my job. This is my work. This is your work." It's all the work from the team.

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:41,200
If something is stopped in the queue, we have to all stop and we all try to fix this or

00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:49,110
to move the impediment or something like that. This is the way we do this, and it works because

00:46:49,340 --> 00:47:00,240
no one wastes still waiting for another's job. No, you have to help them.

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:12,210
We start this with the Q and A team. In the beginning, what we do, the developers

00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:31,380
write the code and deploy and go to the QA. QA finds [inaudible] and back.

00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:44,830
Today the testers and the QA team work with the developers to not have this waiting back.

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:57,170
We do everything with automated tests, so we don't do manual tests in our QA, so the

00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:04,530
test team helps the developers to create the tests, and everything flows much more easily.

00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,600
-This happens in the whole area in the company as well. In the marketing area,

00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,310
in the commercial area we have some things going wrong.

00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:19,990
We talk with somebody, the guys come to us and help to fix this problem or resolve faster.

00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:30,490
That's the way we try. -I know it's almost time for lunch, and some

00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:36,750
people want to leave, I guess, but thank you guys because I know preparing for a presentation

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:43,320
in English, not being even your second language, is hard. But congratulations.

00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,390
I think it's really important what you're trying to communicate and inspire in others.

00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:55,920
I wish that later, perhaps, we can get together some others who are interested in more questions.

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,920
For example, not for right now, but I want to know, you talk of freelancers, but I work

00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,060
and I have a good job, and I have my monthly check.

00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,770
How can you jump into something like this, right?

00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:16,450
This is like throwing yourself off a cliff and being in uncertainty for a good time.

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:23,450
Later on, I will look out for you and have more questions. Thank you again.

00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:37,560
-I'm a big fan of the TOC so I try

00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,360
to apply the TOC theory on our project, but I haven't yet.

00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:52,860
I want to ask you, are you going to use the tool to apply the TOC on your project?

00:49:53,170 --> 00:50:00,170
TOC. Theory of constraint.

00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:17,290
-Actually now we are using [inaudible] methods, you know?

00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:28,630
This is a great method to help us find this flow, so in the beginning we did a lot of

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:37,170
Scrum so it's not working for us, and we moved to [inaudible]. And [inaudible] is based on

00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:44,370
the theory of constraints and this idea of flow. You have to do something flowing. Always flow,

00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:51,730
never back. We try to do that, so we use a lot of tools,

00:50:51,730 --> 00:51:01,210
like JIRA for controlling our process. It depends on the process.

00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,760
In the software projects we use JIRA and the marketing, finances and other areas of

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,480
the company we use at Taller. We use a lot of tools. -The people use the tools for when they need

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,180
to. Oh, I need to use that. I found a great tool

00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:30,540
that helps me to do that, not the inverse. -[inaudible] is to communicate or make the

00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:41,610
information visible to everyone, so we use JIRA for the development so everyone can follow

00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:49,020
the whole process of developing the software we're building. We can use JIRA also for marketers,

00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:57,470
and we also use tools like chat or ERC or something like that because I think it's not

00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:03,780
like the tool that is important. I think it's how you communicate, because

00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,250
the tool is just a way to communicate with your peers.

00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:19,710
Maybe this tool is a good one, we don't know, but they say that right now it's going good,

00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:29,730
so maybe it can be optimized and be better. Actually, today we are not using this tool

00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,820
specifically for the constraint stuff.

00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:44,260
-If you apply the culture in your company, you

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,090
can use the tools that work for you. Because you have a beautiful tool and nobody works

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,950
properly, you don't have the metric. It's easier to have the flow the proper way.

00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,210
What's the name of the tool?

00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:06,030
-I don't remember because I was at the university when I learned the TOC theory.

00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:13,040
In that time, I learned the tool to apply the TOC theory to real industries. I don't remember.

00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:20,770
-Okay, okay. -Last question from me: What's the name of

00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:24,650
your company stand for? -Sorry?

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:31,650
-The name of your company. What does it stand for?

00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:41,090
-Taller in Spanish is workshop, studio, something like that.

00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:45,870
In Portuguese we say taller.

00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:54,960
-[inaudible]

00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:05,020
-We are not an industry of software. We are a taller, not a fabric.

00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:12,540
-Isn't taller like higher? -It can be. It can be, but I don't think so.

00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:19,540
Maybe Sebas.

00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,260
-When you started your business, you started

00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:34,560
doing Drupal from zero or you started with another technology of CMS, you know?

00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:46,630
You did so. Why did you migrate to Drupal, or you always began with Drupal?

00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,660
[Spanish]

00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:04,950
-Yes, but she wants to record the question. When you started your business from zero,

00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:13,790
you started with Drupal from the beginning or you started programming with another software

00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:21,070
from zero, all the programming of the websites or the projects?

00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:27,600
-That's a good question. That is like what we talked about, the Blue

00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,970
Ocean. That's what answers that, because in 2012 we realized that Drupal is really strong

00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:40,970
in the USA, in America an Europe, and Brazil is really weak. Not many companies doing Drupal,

00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,150
and that is why we started with Drupal, just with Drupal. Rafael had a lot of experience

00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:51,290
in a lot of CMS and we met him. We spoke of that, and he showed me that big

00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:59,370
picture in the world, and we started to think it probably is a good way to make a company

00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:06,580
and start with that technology. -When we started the company, I had four years

00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,360
of experience in Drupal and I participated in the Drupal community, and my partner Sebastian

00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:18,590
had a lot of experience too. In this time, we were really focused on Drupal,

00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:25,590
and we did just Drupal and we are a Drupal Shop. We still are a Drupal Shop, but now

00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:33,390
we are starting to do other things that communicate with Drupal, so Drupal is our main business

00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,140
and is what we do with what we are passionate about.

00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:45,140
Now we are trying to work with Java script and [inaudible] and Cordova and JS and other

00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:55,650
technologies that can communicate with Drupal and do the Acquia System and we grow.

00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:03,090
We want to get all the Acquia System to our clients.

00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:18,010
-Congratulations for the presentation. The thing here, I feel I identify with your company because I have the same kind of company.

00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:24,970
I'm a developer. I have a crazy guy like this, and you have to solve all of his problems.

00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:38,670
I can imagine how it is. The thing, SMK, so at this time I'm on some

00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:50,150
way like I'm always doing everything in Drupal. I'm starting to work with another tool. It's [inaudible]

00:57:51,360 --> 00:58:07,160
to manage all the projects and the human resources of the company and accounting things, so what do

00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:16,240
you think about working everything on Drupal and using other tools like [inaudible] to follow

00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:29,820
up your team and everything like that? -I don't know if I understand, but you talk

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,500
about using other tools than Drupal to manage the team.

00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,270
We didn't have any problem. For example, trying to use the Open Atrium,

00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:55,050
we tried using... What's the name for Acquia? Drupal Commons. We tried a lot of tools in Drupal, but

00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:00,190
we really wanted to do the best tool for the job.

00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:09,530
Now, for example, is Yammer for communication, and it's really good.

00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,420
We are starting to regret Open Atrium because it is easier for us to make plugins and make

00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:24,180
modules and it is nice, but I don't think we have any problem with that.

00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,930
The team doesn't complain about that.

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
-Gracias

00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,770
