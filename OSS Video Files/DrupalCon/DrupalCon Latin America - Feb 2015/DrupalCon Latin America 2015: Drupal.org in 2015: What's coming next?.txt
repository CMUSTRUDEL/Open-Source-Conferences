	00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,250
alright I think of giving everybody

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,960
about enough time for finish up their

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,000
lunches and meals I seems like people

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,170
have trickled into everywhere I'm going

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,230
to go ahead and get started I'm Ryan

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,650
asset I'm the infrastructure QA engineer

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,199
with drupal association and presenting

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,060
today on what our strategic roadmap is

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,430
for 2015 and what we're going to be

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:33,899
doing with drupal.org and all of its sub

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:35,910
sites so first of all a little bit of

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,190
background on where we're coming from in

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:45,680
2014 drupal.org has historically been

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:50,030
maintained by mostly volunteers and as a

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,199
consequence of that the community has

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,760
driven most of the initiatives of how

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,780
drupal.org should work and how and what

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,789
sort of functions and features

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,799
drupal.org has and it's reached a point

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,070
where we need to do more with drupal.org

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,820
and can't necessarily rely on solely the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,720
community to get these things

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,030
accomplished and so the drupal

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,470
association staffed up our tech team so

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,720
there's now 11 of us working on

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,250
drupal.org and all of its sub sites so

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,619
we started with two full-time staff

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,369
members that was neil drum and tatiana

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,049
if you're familiar with them and they

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,360
kept things going for a long time but it

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,189
was hard for them to develop new

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,350
initiatives or take on new things that

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,780
would improve the way we work with

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,780
drupal and our access to things and etc

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,090
so here's a little growth chart that

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,579
shows where we've been so neilan tatiana

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,860
there have been holding down the fort

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,149
for the last three years and then we

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,920
have Brendan came on staff he's our

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,210
technical coordinator in internally gets

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,240
us all our laptops that keeps everything

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,610
running inside and then we hired Rudy

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,200
basic and Liz Liz helps manage the

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,720
community basic is one of our

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,480
infrastructure gurus he kind of keeps

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,210
all the servers running keeps everything

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,180
everything going on the back

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,900
and he and then in March we hired Josh

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,370
who is our CTO and he's kind of set the

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,450
direction in the pace for what we're

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,710
going to be working on and how we're

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,050
doing things followed by Oliver Davies

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:34,050
who is a developer so he's doing a lot

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,050
of work on drupalcon sites and on

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,350
drupal.org itself very of the various

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,140
features that we've been working on

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,280
Archie came on staff as another member

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,250
of the infrastructure team so he's

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,330
helping Rudy and then myself I joined as

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,480
well and I'm also on the infrastructure

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,860
team so we try and keep all the servers

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,070
running keep all the backups going make

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,100
sure that everything is accessible and

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,480
everything is always available that's

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,180
how we want we don't want to ripple in

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,930
order to be down so that's one of our

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,550
goals and then recently in September we

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,990
hired Jacob and Emily who they've been

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,120
working on the con sites they helped

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,820
build Rubicon Latin America they and

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,800
also put together a new site events

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,960
drupal.org which we housing Oliver Kahn

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,030
sites in the future and then finally

00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,640
hired Tim who is a project manager and

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,170
he's helping us keep everything in line

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:33,070
and figure out what we're doing next and

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:36,130
keeps us on track so since we added an

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,540
engineering team a lots of things have

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,160
been happening in a kind of a much more

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,410
rapid pace than they have in the past I

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,820
don't know if you've noticed in your

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,960
interactions with drupal.org if you've

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,830
seen some of the things that have

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,570
happened but we wanted to change Drupal

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,310
to run semantic versioning so we wanted

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:56,140
800 and to break the really huge release

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,820
cycle and we had to do a lot of things

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,130
on the infrastructure side as far as get

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,460
and all the database back-end to support

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,080
that so we've added that we removed some

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,400
Drupal 8 beta release blockers things

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,730
that we're stopping the core commuters

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,090
from being able to proceed with Drupal 8

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,950
we added we took over the test pots the

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,480
test pots were managed by community and

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,160
oftentimes it would break and there were

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,870
some issues with them so now we manage

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,160
them and we're kind of on the hook for

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,810
all the test pots a new thing that's

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,010
happened recently is we've imported a

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,310
feature from dreddit err

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:34,060
which is how to give commit credit to

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,530
users as your as users add patches to

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,210
things we've now got this feature that

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,140
shows who participated in the issue

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:44,680
whether they put comments or patches in

00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:48,940
that's that's been deployed as well our

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,800
old user profiles were still an artifact

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,290
of Drupal 6 where they were kind of

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
stored as a profile field and we've

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:59,080
converted those all the entities and

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,060
fields we recently deployed the blue

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,050
cheese as a responsive theme so I don't

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,520
know if you've noticed and looked at

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,920
your blood Oregon a web phone or a

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,320
tablet but it should be a lot easier to

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,030
navigate on various devices we've

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,570
improved the new user experience which

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,350
is as new people come into drupal.org

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,690
there was a lot of kind of outdated best

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,190
practices as far as like logging in and

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,780
then going to your email to get a

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,520
validation and then coming back and

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,080
oftentimes we would lose people through

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,270
that process of trying to accomplish

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,520
what what they want to do so now we have

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,070
a much clearer work flow between

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,690
drupal.org and all the sub sites so if

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,640
you've registered a conference site or

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,590
if you registered groups it'll take you

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:48,310
back to drupal.org and we have kind of a

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:49,870
more unified user process and as I

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,300
mentioned before we've launched events

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,430
Drupal at work so all of our Drupal cons

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,500
now instead of being individual Drupal

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,410
sites can all run as sub sites of one

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,480
large site and so keep code maintenance

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:07,420
down and give us a lot of options that

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:10,450
way um and then finally we launched

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,450
Drupal jobs so Drupal jobs is the place

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,180
where you can find talent if you need

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,380
people we have there's hundreds of

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,750
people in the database that are looking

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,410
for work and we've also got hundreds of

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,290
jobs listed of people who are looking to

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,970
find find talent so that's and that

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,970
supports the drupal association as well

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,760
other things we added a CDN everything

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,470
yeast it comes directly to Drupal

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,840
Detroit servers and now we have the edge

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,820
cast is our CDN so that's that's

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
offloaded a lot of work from our

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,720
internal servers particularly updates

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
i'm not sure if you guys are aware but

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,080
when you have your when you turn on

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,729
updates and it tells you that oh your

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,990
site is out of date or you need to

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,760
upgrade this module or there's some

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,949
security features that have come out

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,180
since then every drupal site in the

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,970
world that has it turned on is hitting

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,280
drupal.org every five minutes or every

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,979
hour asking us for updates so it's it's

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,720
a really heavy amount of traffic that we

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,810
get for that and the CD ins helped a lot

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,200
with that there's a new rest api that

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:20,560
allows you to access issue queues and

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,660
nodes and users and find data that comes

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
back as JSON and there's details on

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,510
drupal at oregon how to leverage that

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,770
some people have already started to

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,360
build tools like Kanban boards and

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,830
project management tools to kind of

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,020
rather than scrape the data off a

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,720
drupal.org they can actually find the

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,400
data they're looking for we implemented

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,740
a change notification policy because

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,870
sometimes things would change and people

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,729
would not know that they were those

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,660
changes were coming or really wanted to

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:52,180
know when that when they were coming

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,590
from internally we've introduced scrum

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,450
project management and we have a much

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,470
better product planning and lifecycle so

00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:01,750
now that we have a team we have a good

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,370
way of organizing that team and so we

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,510
have organized what we're going to be

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,490
working on in the future we have new

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,260
database servers the database server

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,660
that ran drupal.org was seven years old

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,550
and didn't quite have enough horsepower

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,860
to run everything that we wanted to now

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,400
and our new database server is a machine

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,070
it is awesome in the page load time

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,599
should be a lot lots faster now that we

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,160
have that in place so and all of our

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,050
metrics have shown that we've dropped

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,130
300 milliseconds off of every request so

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,860
happy about that and we are performing a

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,450
lot more support so there's a lot less

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,919
reliance on community getting around to

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,050
answering questions about the

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,520
infrastructure and now we can if someone

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,959
has a problem pushing to get we can

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,169
immediately respond to be like oh and

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,990
sorry

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,550
here let us help you fix that so those

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,860
are just some of the winds that we've

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,190
had since we introduced our engineering

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,649
team so just to give you an idea of the

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,620
scale of all the things that we're

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,769
responsible for we move about 20

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:07,990
terabytes of data month like just that

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:11,829
much volume in and out yeah it's it's

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,110
pretty huge in fact this slide is really

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:17,500
dense but it's kind of gives you an idea

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,630
every one of those blue squares is is a

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,019
server is a site q edad drupal.org

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,630
updates infrastructure all the code

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,519
browsing all the AP is the association's

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,639
site all the drupalcon sites the drupal

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,680
store the job site the security site I

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,110
mean the there's this many sites in the

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,269
Drupal ecosystem on drupal.org and these

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,370
are all within our responsibility and

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,290
it's running on a lot of machines we've

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,610
got four web nodes a couple of file

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:48,910
servers for database servers a couple of

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,560
load balancers solar search servers and

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,779
then an entire infrastructure of

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,540
development stuff inside that allows us

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,490
to stage and develop changes to

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,829
drupal.org so it's it's a lot of

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,690
machinery and a lot of moving parts the

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:05,709
red stuff is all things that people

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,940
would perceive as core to drupal.org but

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,370
are actually community supported and

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,670
community developed so things like drush

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,570
and simple test me and creditor that's

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,910
it right okay so with all of the history

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,290
of how long we've been around and all of

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,850
the things we want to accomplish and all

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,230
the things that people have asked for

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,279
four years like oh why don't we have

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,800
this or why don't we have that'd be

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,510
great of people to herb did this we kind

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,130
of had to go through all of that and

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,630
prioritize what we were going to do and

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,480
say well something's got to come first

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,120
so how do we do that we started with

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,550
user research we decided to go to the

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,889
community and during drupalcon Amsterdam

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,040
or I'm sorry Google con Austin we

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,990
interviewed 30 different users of all

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,779
different spectrums from developers to

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:53,649
site builders to end customers to kind

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,360
of find out what they needed to from

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,130
drupal.org and what were the features

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,330
and functions and

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,260
and kind of to figure out who our

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:05,530
audience was to figure out and so we

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,990
came up with these user personas to kind

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,030
of put people in categories they're

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,860
using the site to give us an idea of who

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,160
or who we're currently serving and who

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,020
we need to serve better so we've got

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,490
learners well we got newcomers people

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,560
they've heard about Drupal they're just

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,680
they've run a google search and land on

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,060
drupal.org which is surprisingly large

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,130
number of traffic comes from a search

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:32,050
for just the word Drupal learners are

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,890
people who they know a Drupal is it

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,210
started install sites but they're not

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,880
customizing too much they're just kind

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,930
of getting their feet wet skilled these

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,970
are people who they've got an

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,860
understanding of Drupal their fluid in

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,300
Drupal specific terminology they know

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,290
what a view is they know what content

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,310
types are there often engaged in the

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,930
community but not totally they're not

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,250
necessarily going to camps yet or or

00:11:52,930 --> 00:12:00,300
Drupal cons and our experts these are

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:05,530
the people who really understand Drupal

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,620
they they are the ones that are hanging

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,550
out in IRC they're the ones that are

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,740
answering questions when people ask

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,910
there they've got a deep understanding

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,700
of Drupal and they actively contribute

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,960
back there building modules they're

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,640
submitting patches and then finally we

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,110
have masters and these are the people

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,380
that have been around the Drupal

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,530
ecosystem since the beginning or have

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,640
really doe themselves in really deep and

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,140
they're committing to core they

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,170
understand everything that's going on

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,930
they've been to all the cons there there

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:43,000
the Drupal rock stars for to put it in

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:48,250
you know in that terminology so when we

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,200
evaluated this this skills pyramid what

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,550
we found is that we were having we were

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,990
pretty much serving the Masters pretty

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,210
well they knew their way around the way

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,410
everything worked the experts weren't

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,290
having too hard of a time figuring

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,910
things out but the place where we needed

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,680
to improve is getting people from

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,780
newcomers to learners or learners to

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,100
skilled or skill to expert we it was

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,960
really the bottom half of the pyramid

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,089
that you know when you first started

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,480
working with drupal.org it it was

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,480
probably

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,550
easy to collide with information that

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,320
was outdated or you didn't know where to

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,820
look for what you were looking for or it

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,920
was just organized in such a way that

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,180
made it harder for those people so we

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,949
definitely need to increase the number

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,709
of successful developers that use Drupal

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:33,699
and so that's where we decided to put

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:37,329
some of our focus so with that research

00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:44,589
in hand then we wanted to turn into a

00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:46,329
plan so some of the goals that we want

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,829
to accomplish with this we want to make

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:50,170
sure that we continue to fund drew blood

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,690
org and pay for all of this because it's

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,300
you know the Association has to have to

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,560
get its funding from somewhere we need

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,970
to make sure that everyone has support

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,670
and has all the maintenance they pay and

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,810
keep all the servers running we want to

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,730
drive everything from community

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,139
initiatives because people have put in

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,339
time and effort over the years and

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,870
they're good at it and we need to

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,600
leverage as much as we can out of that

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,839
and then finally the board and the

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,480
working group priorities help us kind of

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,670
set our direction so the working groups

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,000
they were established in early 2013 they

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:25,269
had there's a Content working group and

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,459
the Drupal software tools working group

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,569
and documentation working group and I'm

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:31,569
sure some other working groups that I'm

00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:33,760
not sure of they ran an ideation process

00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,750
which was like well what what do we want

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,279
to fix what do you want to make better

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,589
how do we want to improve Trueblood org

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,290
and every year we kept coming with the

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,670
same themes the same things kind of kept

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,389
happening and we're like well these are

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,480
the things we should work on so we set

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,560
up some objectives what did we want it

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,180
to be we want to be the home of the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,060
Drupal community a central source of

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,199
relevant info where everyone comes to

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,050
collaborate and this is where all the

00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,430
talent is we want we want drupal.org to

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,779
be the place where everybody goes for

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,459
Drupal information we're trying to keep

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,470
it from being spread all over the web in

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,660
different places in different spots so

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,779
no one knows where to go want it to be

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,209
centralized I want to provide all the

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,470
tools that one needs to advance within

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:16,720
the Drupal ecosystem we want to provide

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,600
all the documentation and all the code

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,410
and all the tutorials and videos and

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,079
opportunities to advance

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,910
and we want to encourage people to

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,350
develop themselves and their Drupal

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:33,949
proficiency and also build their own

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:35,839
career so we set up key performance

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:38,540
indicators to say well okay how do we

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
how do we measure this and you know some

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,870
of this stuff is like well some things

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,329
we know like pâté response time and test

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,879
spot response time and uptime and how

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:50,660
engaged are our users to let us know are

00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:54,529
we making things better we keep up with

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,810
the issue queues and make sure that our

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,949
issue response time is you know minimal

00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,870
if someone's having problem with yet we

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:03,439
try and get back with them within 24

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,449
hours we were improving our testing

00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:07,069
we've got a BDD infrastructure for

00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:11,959
drupal.org that makes sure that new

00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:14,810
deployments keep keep from breaking well

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,519
we keep keep bad things out of

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,660
production with the tests I'm not sure

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,639
with the development employment but

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,899
bullet is work and else want to maximize

00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,750
our hardware we're running out the

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,220
open-source labs out of Oregon and we

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,550
run some stuff on amazon web services

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,139
and we use the edge cast CDN so we want

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,399
to we want to make sure that we've

00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,560
getting the most out of what we've got

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,230
and we've got a lot so it's there's a

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:47,600
lot of opportunities for keeping our

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:49,790
performance going there sure well it's a

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,329
combination of etch cast and now we're

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,380
also looking at fastly for ftp because

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,279
that was another piece of the

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,250
infrastructure that we're looking to

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,389
improve is when you download modules

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,130
withdraw sure when you download them off

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,779
the website it's using kind of an

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,140
antiquated system that's only mirror to

00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:08,689
three spots and so so based off of all

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,809
of that input from you know what we want

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:14,449
to improve and what the community's

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,939
asked for and the kind of things that

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,230
we're targeting we've got seven key

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,510
strategic initiatives that we're going

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,819
to work on in 2015 so this is these are

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,900
the main things so new user engagement

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:28,909
so with new users we want to fix the

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,039
account creation and login process we're

00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:33,590
pretty far down this path and are almost

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,790
finished with this actually so it should

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,870
end up that we have one unit

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:41,030
I login across all drupal sub sites and

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,010
it yeah it's it'll be really nice that

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,630
we have that we won't have to worry so

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,220
much about someone's logged in here but

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,460
not there and they don't have an account

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,590
here and there and that'll also

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,240
facilitate things like if people want to

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,830
sign up for a con and they want to buy a

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,970
ticket for the drupalcon but they don't

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,110
have an account yet and they create the

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,820
account and then they forget about it

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,040
because they have to login for to their

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,300
email and we're just making that user

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,020
workflow and user experience a lot

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,970
better we're introducing organization

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,710
and user profile improvements so the

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:14,840
user profiles used to be just kind of a

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,490
list of a bunch of things and we've

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,650
organized them and made them look a lot

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,180
better I don't know if you've seen them

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,710
but now there's like pictures of mentors

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,070
on there than where it used to be links

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,660
and all in all it really shows a lot

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,350
more how much you participate in the

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,090
Drupal community if you're if you've

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,920
seen your profiles but the introduction

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,080
of organizations is a it's a new thing

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,020
as well and this kind of falls on from

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,270
trees keynotes and direction which is

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,790
that we want to give organizations more

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,550
credit traditionally organizations have

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,750
been individuals have been the only

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,760
people allowed to have accounts on

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,650
drupal.org and that was so that

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,930
organizations didn't take credit for the

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,370
individual's contribution but now we're

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,130
going to have both and people will be

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,570
able to have credit for stuff that they

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,010
do but then also put that on the

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,840
organization's page to say this

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,340
organization sponsored this module this

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,890
organization paid for me to work on this

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:11,060
patch and that way or it's get credit as

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,220
well as users and hopefully help sustain

00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,630
the ecosystem because not everybody can

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,250
work on there in their spare time on

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,210
this sort of thing to contribute to the

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:24,380
community we're working on a content

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:25,430
strategy for drupal org one of the

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,920
things you may have noticed is that

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,260
everything is node / number in the URL

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,280
which doesn't give the user any

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,470
indication of where they're at whether

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,960
than a forum or an issue queue whether

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,250
they're reading documentation so even

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,540
just the URL structure is something

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,370
we're working on and figuring out okay

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,720
well do we need forum posts should we

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,550
move this to some other type of content

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,500
type what type of content do we actually

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,800
want to have

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,120
and so rather than take the well we've

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,480
got the content that's evolved over the

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,400
years into what it is now we want to

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,740
kind of reassess that and and come up

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,970
with a actual here's what would work

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,490
best for the community to help the

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,290
newcomers to help the experts and to

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,720
help the scale people grow their career

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:13,330
and along with that will come and

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:15,910
redesign including like a design

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,680
strategy and so that we can have

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,210
reusable modules of design to be able to

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,400
introduce new initiatives without too

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:26,230
much work to build new content types or

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,540
new displays we're going to work on the

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,220
issue workflow with get as I'm sure

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,730
you're aware but the patch based

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,680
workflow is a relic of the CBS era and

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,150
we're still on it even though we have

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,100
get in the background and a lot of

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,650
people have asked for will have a pull

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,570
requests or how about something of that

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,370
nature and we're working on it we've got

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,380
a we've got a plan for that and so we're

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:51,280
going to change the way that code gets

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:55,360
added and worked on on drupal.org we're

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,670
going to make search usable I did has

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,100
anybody use the search on drupal.org or

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:05,220
do you go to google and type site

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,220
google.org right yeah

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,120
yeah yes yes and so we're going to make

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,330
it much more usable we're going to make

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,820
it so that's valuable and along with the

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,340
search kind of tied to that is finding

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,530
modules because when you look at the

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,210
number six the improved tools to find

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,640
and select projects when you look at a

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,780
module there's some signals that we that

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,040
you know the longer you've been around

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,540
the Drupal ecosystem the more you know

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,460
oh I'm going to look at how many times

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,680
it's been installed or oh I'm going to

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,970
look at who the maintainer is or I'm

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,060
going to look at you know whatever

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,280
there's a whole bunch of signals that

00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,920
you kind of learn over time to figure

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,560
out how to evaluate modules and when we

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,510
think about us hosting all of the Drupal

00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,090
modules in one place we're really like

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,000
an app store for Drupal for the Drupal

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,430
ecosystem and so we need to get a better

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,770
process in place for getting new modules

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,710
into the ecosystem as well as of being

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,300
able to quickly and easily evaluate the

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,400
quality and usability of those modules

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,150
so that people can find what they're

00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,050
looking for to extend their sites and

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,910
finally we're going to update drupal

00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:18,330
groups it's still running on Drupal 6

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:21,770
and we're going to yeah pull in some of

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,760
its functionality make it rupal 7 and

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,450
kind of give it a little bit of a

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,960
refresh so those are the seven strategic

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,070
initiatives on the drupal org roadmap

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,080
that's hopefully what you can look

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,610
forward to in 2015 or working on it

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,670
pretty quick so some little bit more

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,840
details on the account creation login so

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:47,340
why do we focus on this well the

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,810
workflows hard for newcomers we need to

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,290
engage our users and encourage them to

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,970
contribute spammers really love how easy

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,190
it is to get started with drupal.org we

00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,170
get 10,000 accounts a month that are

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,000
just sleeper accounts that spammers are

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,920
automatically generating and they're

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,450
hard to stop because they're just a

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:08,460
count creation and yeah and the roles

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,780
and permissions in this in Drupal

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,180
network we want to change to reflect

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,220
people's position in the community so

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,610
we're adding a new role progression that

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,600
allows people to become confirmed and

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,580
community members that allow them to

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,470
trust other users we're basically making

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,980
a web of trust

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:29,270
out of out of the roles of permissions

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,799
plus this account creation is you know

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:34,309
kind of the key to security for the

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,200
drupal.org which back in March we had a

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,169
breach I'm sure you're aware of and

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,870
their March 2013 a long time ago so

00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:47,090
we've been focused on sealing up all the

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:53,299
possibilities of making sure that that

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:54,770
doesn't happen one ok so we've

00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,539
simplified the registration process

00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,700
we've added a lot more spam prevention

00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:02,210
systems in place to prevent account

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,280
creations prevent people from marketing

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,350
their SEO on Drupal which has pretty

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,580
high PageRank so we're a pretty big

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:12,500
target we are tracking engagement so

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,150
we're trying to figure out who's using

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,970
the site how are they using the site and

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,640
how much of the site do they use and

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,990
using that as a metric to kind of decide

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,690
we're doing these things to improve you

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:27,049
engagement did it work so this is one of

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,820
the things we have added our new user

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,950
role progression so this is what I just

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,270
mentioned before people when they first

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,610
create an account or just authenticated

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,840
but some I don't know if anyone's create

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,299
an account a long time but I've seen

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,659
that uh not a spammer role that people

00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:43,159
are asking for we have a honeypot module

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,320
that was often trapping people stopping

00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,570
them from from promoting their their

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,490
first question saying oh sorry and it

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,470
kind of makes people feel not welcomed

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,210
if they're just trying to ask a question

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,559
and they get shut down so we want to

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,049
make sure new users are welcome so we

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,640
have this confirmed option that we're

00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,820
going to be rolling out to the community

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,580
to be able to confirm other users so

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,840
there's you know anybody in ice in IRC

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,130
that's been around the community a long

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,690
time could just automatically confirm a

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,990
new user if they have a problem so kind

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,940
of spreads the load out and then of

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,549
course we've kind of reworded everything

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,159
that was worded by volunteers at one

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:23,450
point by some really savvy and sharp

00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:28,480
portsmouth's so these are just some of

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,480
the ideas that were pitched for possible

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,809
user profile improvements of how like

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,580
people can actually see what you've done

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:35,510
and how you contributed and who you work

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,400
for and

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:44,000
organization pages didn't know that

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,440
animation was there so for the improved

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,600
profiles these are the things we heard

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,180
in user research of like why people

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,320
wanted their profiles improved so when

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,870
you look at someone's page you want to

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,400
know who they are in the community if

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,590
someone says hey you should do x and y

00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,180
and z it's nice to be able to go there

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,140
page and say oh this guy's credible he

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,060
really knows what he's talking about

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:07,280
he's been around for 13 years working on

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,630
this which is what leads into knowing

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,670
whether they have expertise in the area

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,460
are asking about or they know what

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:17,330
they're doing it also helps to know how

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,770
long they've been a member what's it

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,120
makes it easier to find other members of

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,440
the community if like you go to

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,970
someone's page and they list for other

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,620
people as mentors you're like who are

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,330
these people and then maybe you'll see

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,980
them at a con be like oh I'd seen your

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:34,010
page before and you kind of know a

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:37,070
little bit more about them and finally

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,920
just having a page it's kind of like a

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,420
resume you know to allow people to come

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,620
and look at your drupal.org page and say

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,290
yeah here's my profile here's what I'm

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,870
doing with drupal.org I can help your

00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:50,750
company I can help your clients this is

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,990
what I know so you can trust their

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:57,790
answers in code so some of the

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,840
improvements that we've already got

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,670
organization pages we focused on

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,620
organization pages this isn't how they

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:10,160
look now I need to update this slide and

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,370
that was another profile thing so

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,810
organizations at the key to our growth

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,480
so both providers and customer

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:21,290
organizations so we've got some media

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,830
companies that build a lot of Drupal

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:27,800
sites and we've also got major clients

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,140
that have a Drupal site on staff like

00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,230
government agencies and other large

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:36,410
organizations so we're looking for both

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,710
Drupal shops as well as customer

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:43,070
organizations we want to highlight their

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,540
contributions we want to turn their

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,190
contributions into successful case

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,590
studies to demonstrate everybody else

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,330
what you can do with Drupal

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,780
as they help support modules and themes

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:57,059
we want the rest of the world to know

00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,830
and we want to incentivize organizations

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,419
to help do that to help 10 the comments

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,559
because we've got this great product

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,740
that's been built out of community

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,540
effort up for you know 13 14 15 years

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,990
and it's reaching the point that it's so

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:13,049
huge that we need all all the time that

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,850
companies can give us to keep running

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,549
and keep it going and keeping having

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,960
momentum so we want to incentivize those

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:20,610
companies to participate we want to

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,720
incentivize companies to send people to

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,790
Drupal cons we want to incentivize

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,020
companies to do things and this is one

00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:30,720
of the ways that we're going to do it is

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:34,080
with organization pages so our content

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,660
strategy and redesign being responsive

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,280
is more than just the theme we want the

00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,370
content that people are looking for in

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,830
the places where they would look for it

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,750
so we have new content types we have a

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,840
we're coming up with a better content

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,020
governance model so there's a lot of

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,179
content on drupal.org that there's

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,010
documentation pages that are out of date

00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,620
there's there's information that's

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,540
inaccurate sometimes because we don't

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,450
really have a gatekeeper of who can post

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:07,260
what it's pretty pretty Wikipedia

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,520
freeform anybody can add and

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,540
additionally we're going to add a design

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:17,730
system to that so that we can leverage

00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:21,390
leverage those design pieces ah the the

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:26,429
git workflow so how many of you are

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:29,130
submitting patches to issue qs c 1

00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:35,700
anybody else work with the issue keys

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:36,929
very much ok um this is a the initiative

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,790
that i'm going to be help driving so

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:43,230
it's the way that the code is written in

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:47,730
the way the code is built on drupal.org

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,919
is like i said before it's a kind of an

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,299
antiquated patchwork low and so we want

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,360
to move more towards something similar

00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,460
to what github has with pull requests

00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,740
such that we can use the leverage the

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,220
power of get to be able to move change

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,770
for

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,070
on drupal.org so we've got our canonical

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,020
project repository and every time an

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,480
issue gets created we'll start an issue

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,039
workspace repository so this is instead

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
of like here's my patch there will be a

00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,429
hole it'll almost be like a fork for

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,870
that entire issue that will be

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:23,820
integrated with the test pots as it is

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,600
now and they'll still be the issue queue

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,380
conversation that goes on so

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,789
additionally contributors will have

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,970
their own repose which are versions of

00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:37,440
that issue workspace and we're going to

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:39,179
add inline editing to the workflow which

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,350
will allow users to I mean oftentimes a

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,120
patch gets submitted and everything's

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,970
fine but you need to change some spacing

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,260
and you need to you know change some

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,909
vocabulary they'll be a lot easier

00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,130
people can just change that in line

00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:56,960
rather than clone the whole repo make

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:56,960
another patch and submit it sure

00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,060
well sort of the I'm going to get into

00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,720
that a little bit it's it's actually a

00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:16,720
function of get that it's called issue

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:21,220
namespaces or it's called get namespaces

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,290
it allows you to have a whole nother set

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:28,540
of branches and tags internally to get

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:29,980
that is not part of the like if you just

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,690
clone the base repository you won't see

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,030
those but if you clone the namespace for

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,380
that issue you will see those and so it

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,150
allows kind of another workspace where

00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,890
people can work and not interfere with

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,130
like wherever the core main line is

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:44,110
happening so it's it's similar to a pull

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,580
request but the the workspace is created

00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,710
on drupal.org and then you'll clone that

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,970
and so instead of forking the module

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,080
local you'll do it on Drupal are kind of

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,790
like you do with github where you fork

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:58,420
and it creates it it'll do the same

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:59,800
thing so one of the things that we heard

00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,440
and why are we doing this instead of

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,540
moving over to github or something

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,910
similar well the core contributors

00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,930
didn't feel like the pull requests

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,240
implemented on github would work for the

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,730
current workflow so core definitely has

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,800
a much more collaborative community

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:18,340
based workflow that doesn't would not

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,720
translate to github but they also know

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,030
that the workflow that they're used to

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,160
doesn't help new users new users come in

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,770
and there's a 14 step process to make a

00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,500
patch and then another 16 step process

00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,260
to change that patch and add an inner

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,450
div so you have to learn about 30 things

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,580
to be able to even contribute which we

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,920
want to want to change that it works now

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,080
people have built Drupal on it but we

00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,770
want to make it better so our options

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,140
were keep everything the same which no

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,810
one's really happy with or we could move

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,760
to github or we could switch to a new

00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,170
internal software to a like get lab or a

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,960
fabricator or something like that and

00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:00,280
host it internally or we can modernize

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,100
our current Drupal ettarde workflow so

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,450
pull requests not something new people

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,190
have been asking for it for years this

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:11,830
is one of those things that comes up

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:13,720
again and again so when you look at the

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,760
slides online after I post them that

00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,160
this gives a lot of links to all the

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,710
different places where people have

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,610
talked about

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,990
this and options and reasons why but the

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:29,120
main thing that we kept coming back to

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:32,330
of why not to move to github is that the

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,039
poll requests versus issues is there's a

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,190
fundamental difference in the data model

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:39,559
between pull requests and issues with

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,480
the pull request you have a code Delta

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,909
this is what code we're going to change

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,940
and then you can discuss that one change

00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:49,010
if that change is an adequate or needs

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,539
to change it needs to be modified then

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,789
you have to fork the pull request and

00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,500
then another conversation starts up in

00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:56,510
another place and if that's not quite

00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,549
right then you have another poll request

00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,159
and so the conversation gets forked

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:05,600
along with the thing that you're trying

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,950
to accomplish and so under border we

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,659
don't want that we want to keep it to

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,599
where all the conversation happens in

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,190
the same place and we can keep multiple

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:19,520
code Delta's associated with one issue

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:21,320
workspace so none of those options that

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,270
we were talking about as you know moving

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,190
to get number easy like we can't just

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,169
move to get up there's a crazy amount of

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,460
other interdependencies on the inside as

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:32,480
far as like updates go and other

00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,250
packaging scripts and downloading new

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,440
modules just moving everything to get

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:41,089
happen to be a lot lower plus it would

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,830
require people to learn some new tools

00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,379
if they aren't using it how do you know

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,119
a lot of people are but then something

00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:49,940
might say we're on an island because

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,980
we're not in Vietnam but this is such a

00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,720
hard problem wordpress hasn't you know

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,480
there's gone subversion they don't think

00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,470
they don't want to rock their boat

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:05,450
either as so it's just migrating as a

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,790
huge problem so oh good i'm showing you

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,030
conceded

00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:14,440
that was another way of using you have

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:16,510
an API neighborhood in another room

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,940
behind the scenes and folsom quotes but

00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:25,570
using the API as an alternative to meet

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,420
you well yeah we had considered that but

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,920
again then adds another external

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
dependency to the whole system that

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,820
we're now we have to rely on github

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,010
always being there working in order for

00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:39,030
us to our stuff to work and additionally

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:41,650
the integrating with your API part it's

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,260
just as much I mean it really only saves

00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:47,200
us d we still have to have all the

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,400
interface on our side that does all the

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,100
same functionality but that just makes

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,620
the call to their API and subdue our our

00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,950
function so it didn't mean kind of a

00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,780
wash you didn't we did look at that and

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,000
so the way that we can do this under

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,320
people in orbit with issue workspaces so

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,850
this is a modernized version of the

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,650
current workflow maintains a

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:09,040
collaborative model that we don't wanna

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,300
maintain so it's not a new idea in fact

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,940
when they were talking about the great

00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,950
get migration from CBS years ago this

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,210
was always part of the plan they were

00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,490
saying we want to have her tissue

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:23,470
repository when I have a way to work on

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:25,240
code on an issue by issue basis so we're

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,850
going to update these accuses support a

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,420
pull request like workflow as well as

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,280
adding the inline editing which as I

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,420
said before will be a huge boon to

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,650
people that need to make just small

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,660
changes to things as initial bonus we

00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,190
can keep the apache base workflow in

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,500
place because that's that's what we

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,150
really want to do is everybody's used to

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,980
something we don't want to just throw it

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,080
out and say here's your new tool and

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,790
everyone has to adapt immediately and be

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,410
completely disrupted we're going to

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,030
change this such that you would still

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,890
submit a patch and in the background i

00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,750
will create an intuition work that issue

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,190
workspace with a commit on it and other

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,320
people can come and clone it and hold

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,110
and you can keep adding patches and it

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,720
is to work so that's that's kind of a

00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:11,280
win as far as like process workflow and

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,280
continuity you don't have to

00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:20,600
disrupt everybody so this is an example

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,670
of an actual issue that happened on

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:27,100
Drupal for number of years ago and

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:30,410
here's kind of how it would look like so

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,120
starts off dominar created an issue

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,410
workspace and then this is kind of in

00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,720
the future he would create an issue

00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,520
workspace clone it and push that change

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,210
to his branch on that issue room space

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:46,130
so he's got a workspace called 1740 419

00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:48,980
and then xjm ceases changes and says oh

00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,570
hey you know we can clean this up this

00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,580
patch is good but we just need some

00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,950
other you know change the wording here

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,240
at six facing there and so she would use

00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,100
the inline editor instead of submitting

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,530
another batch like she did before and

00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,990
then he pulls her changes is oh okay

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,190
great that works out elbow that and I'm

00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,510
going to add some more convince and keep

00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:10,580
changing things because some quite work

00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:12,650
the way I want to do and then this is

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,960
where currently we have to do patch

00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,430
rerolls so Patrick roles will go away

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,810
because you could just merge back in

00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,430
from head so that you can be like well

00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:23,420
this thing i'm working on it's out of

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:26,210
date let me catch it up so he would work

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,380
on that workspace and then Damien comes

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,660
along and says oh I want to work on this

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:33,830
now so I'm going to pull off the latest

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,780
and they make some more commits and

00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:50,870
those numbers of parentheses are like

00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:53,060
the actual commit message numbers yes

00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:55,970
the the question was what about unit

00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:59,390
testing for the for those patches as

00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,590
people add commits to their repos and

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,210
then push them back up to the issue

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,800
workspace that will trigger the new

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,230
drupal CI infrastructure to run tests

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,970
against it which is going to be a lot

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,220
more robust and have a lot more options

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,110
as far as I want to change ada basics

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,090
runs on I want to change which HP

00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,609
options are set those those are the kind

00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,589
of people

00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:19,440
expand in the testing infrastructure so

00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:21,930
that you'll have the ability that kind

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,660
of moved test what you want to test and

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,630
make sure it works that he wanted to so

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,789
in this example dollar biked Damien's

00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:33,450
changes and hold them back in his and

00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:36,150
move or and then da stroke came along

00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:39,720
was like oh have some ideas has water so

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:43,380
he pulls a patch utter he clones the

00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,630
latest issue workspace adds another

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,039
commit to it that water comes back to

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,420
the issues that you know I don't think I

00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,619
want those changes so I don't have to

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,450
worry about it I'm not to look at which

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,910
matches the latest or what I'll just

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,910
keep working on my own branch in the

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,859
issue queue and so he added some more

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,480
patches and then j hodgson comes along

00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:02,339
and says oh well you know this need some

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,839
documentation edits so let me fix the

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:07,079
documentation out of this patch meds in

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,980
so she can use the amide editor to make

00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,690
the change to the documentation and then

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,609
I wonder pulls it back in takes her

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:19,079
suggestions pulls them back into his his

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:20,400
local branch of the workspace and then

00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,440
when he's done with it he could say okay

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,690
I think there's our TV see this is time

00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,309
to push this up to the community and

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,900
then I'll spot fix it you could say okay

00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:29,279
let's merge all these squash all these

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,400
convince together to make one nice merge

00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:34,380
commits to say here is this change it's

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,049
going to affect Google gore and he'll

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,269
merge it and push it back into head and

00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:42,059
so that's kind of how the new get

00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:47,180
workflow will work there's we've got a

00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:49,049
lot a lot to do on that that's probably

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:54,269
Barcelona is where we're aiming to have

00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:57,960
that like implemented so any questions

00:40:54,269 --> 00:41:01,650
about forget workflow I'm not seeing any

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,269
hands great so we want to make another

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:07,710
initiative is we want to make search

00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:10,200
usable so our search yeah like we said

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,660
pretty much everybody uses people uses

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,099
Google to search Drupal to find what

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,839
they need on Drupal and so people want

00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,920
to find what they want to find they want

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,230
to figure out whether month is worth

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,430
using they want to know what modules are

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,020
available

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,089
want to be able to find documentation we

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:31,410
want to be able to find a solution to

00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:33,770
their problems so it's not rocket

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,030
surgery we can fix this pretty easily

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,940
we're going to improve the way that

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,430
solar setup we're going to prove the way

00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,829
the display modes work so when search

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,150
results come back from solar and has the

00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:48,030
relevant information you're looking for

00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,950
in a dense package you're going to have

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,720
better than facets and this comes back

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,150
to the content strategy of light when

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,109
you get a module back what are the

00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:58,290
pieces of information you might be

00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:59,640
looking forward on module I mean maybe

00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,280
you just want to filter by d eight

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,390
modules and that's you know those sorts

00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,880
of things should be available in search

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,400
and then we also want my organization

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,109
from users show up in search so if

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,880
someone searches for views you should

00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:14,339
also respond with murder the chaos this

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,930
is profile because he felt views for

00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:24,839
example for anyone that's been

00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:26,190
maintaining it by the way and in

00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,640
addition with surge we also want to

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:32,220
improve how people find it's like

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,829
products so like I was mentioning before

00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,740
this is how you can find out a quality

00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:39,990
project oh and then this is a problem

00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,180
that's kind of universal to the web like

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,589
I have a lot of products which one's the

00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,849
best one to choose a lot of restaurants

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,020
to go to which one's the best one to

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:47,280
choose there's a lot of apps on the App

00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,000
Store which one's the best one to choose

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,589
so there's a lot of design patterns out

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,109
there that we can follow emulate and

00:42:52,589 --> 00:43:02,910
some of those are you know let's see

00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:04,650
ratings and reviews Health metrics

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,380
things like oh there hasn't been any

00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,450
commit on this module for you know two

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,069
years he had there's been 22 issues that

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,750
don't respond to those sorts of metrics

00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:14,069
that let us know the like close module

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,940
looks like it's number to maintain so

00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:19,559
use it your own risk and will will be

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,710
surfacing that information month in a

00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:26,339
much easier way as opposed to just kind

00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:28,380
of happen to know what to check for will

00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:30,690
be able to have project comparisons so

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,589
make easier to say which twitter block

00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,269
model

00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:35,430
you know which one is going to integrate

00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:38,690
with the API or which one it's going to

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,650
be just there Jack JavaScript version

00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,029
that's one be able to reference case

00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,579
studies on project pages so every time

00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:46,259
some modules used to do something really

00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,170
impressive we want to go to say oh this

00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:50,819
this site used it so whenever there's a

00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,069
case study that says decent lodges we

00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,569
used to build we want to give credit to

00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:56,789
the module maintained errs that hey you

00:43:54,569 --> 00:44:01,890
you helped make NBC com possible you

00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:03,839
helped make Kessler possible so better

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,630
tagging and classifications of projects

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,769
that's again back to our content

00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:13,890
strategy and our taxonomy of how people

00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:19,769
find fighters and modules on drupal.org

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,969
and finally drupal groups so there's

00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:22,529
some things we heard from user research

00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:24,420
they want to find out what Drupal events

00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:26,339
are happening and connecting with other

00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,249
members of the community and making with

00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:30,599
local user groups and want to find news

00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,599
and updates from the role of improves

00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:37,109
and they want to know where is the next

00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:38,789
it will use your me up so roots is where

00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:41,940
a lot of the community happens and we

00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:44,880
want to keep that momentum rolling we

00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:48,390
want to keep groups is kind of like our

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:52,229
meetup got or before Drupal so we want

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,549
to enhance what's there upgraded to

00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:57,809
Drupal 7 so we have a lot less

00:44:53,549 --> 00:45:03,019
maintenance Burton and keep its value

00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:06,479
and and expand its value for ism so

00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:08,789
what's next the google everett roadmap

00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:10,410
we're keeping updates there we're

00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,739
tagging issues in the issue views with

00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,880
specific tags for what we're working on

00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:16,739
we're always welcome to volunteer

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,950
assistance if people have ideas on how

00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:21,690
these things could work there's pretty

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,059
much all of these have a community-based

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,979
input phase or like okay this is what we

00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,239
think we want to do and we put it out to

00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:28,829
the community to community can come back

00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,569
with like did you think of this or do

00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:32,969
you think of that and it's awesome

00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:35,430
because we have you know hundreds of

00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:37,170
thousands of people who know what

00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,789
they're doing in our community and so

00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,349
it's great to be able to have that sort

00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:41,350
of feedback so we appreciate anything

00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:46,190
that

00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:47,390
you wouldn't want to contribute hey how

00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,440
is there any any questions about

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:53,560
drupal.org and our infrastructure sure

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:58,490
you mention it you using very scrum

00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:02,300
methodology what is the decision-making

00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:06,020
process exactly for example the changes

00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:10,760
where the organization's profile and

00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:14,540
they get credited for what they do the

00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:17,290
algorithm is used in h cases where is it

00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:20,150
credit to the individual divid

00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:23,510
organizational both who makes those

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,280
decisions um it does don't necessarily

00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,020
come up in our scrums or our scrubs are

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,440
really just a daily check-in the same

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,910
was working on what so but that the

00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,670
decision-making process on those sort of

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,320
things we have tech team meetings once a

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,690
week where we'll have something like

00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,270
that where people are stuck on well this

00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,400
this has an impact on how the actual

00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,990
functionality works and so we've got

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,120
some people who are product owners and

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,820
managers like tatianna is the product

00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,310
owner drupal.org so she kind of has the

00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,750
final decision authority based off of

00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,660
her knowledge of the community and how

00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,280
things should work of if it comes down

00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,770
to who should get credit on this a user

00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,420
an organization like I think there are

00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:05,450
just some judgment calls apparently that

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,970
people make on those sorts of things but

00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:09,860
at the same time we definitely put that

00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,660
out to the community any any time that

00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,950
has a judgment call we're like okay

00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,530
here's what we think it should do does

00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:16,940
everyone agree and there's usually an

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,260
opportunity for the community to get

00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,900
involved saying well actually I don't

00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,640
because if this education X me so that's

00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,640
that's usually how the process works

00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:36,110
where's the space it's in drupal.org

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,000
issue use yeah so we've got and we

00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,620
maintain that as our place where as

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,480
working on stuff we put it back in so

00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,920
because we don't want to just develop

00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,110
things in a vacuum because we know that

00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,390
the community is built what's there now

00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,869
and it's great and we're just going to

00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,430
drive it forward from there and

00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,319
you know we definitely want to build

00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:57,420
something the community doesn't want so

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:59,940
he always wanted community back anybody

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,900
else have any other questions about the

00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:07,430
future of people that order I see no

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,430
