Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: El proceso del theming, UI & UX junto al cliente.
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: betoquiroga
Cuando iniciamos un proyecto de pequeño o gran tamaño lo que más nos puede dificultar el proceso es una buena relación con el cliente.

Y a la hora de empezar a estructurar el aspecto visual de nuestro proyecto (theming para nosotros) cómo podemos de una manera correcta incluir al cliente como nuestro mejor aliado a la hora de procesar sus ideas? Que exactamente está pensando el cliente?

Será que los diseñadores, maquetadores, themers están realmente tan locos que no pueden contentar al cliente? Un wireframe, un mockup, el diseño, el theming. Que esta no sea una charla normal, veamos casos particulares de como hacer que el cliente se involucre en el equipo de desarrollo cómo el mejor aliado y no como alguien que quisieramos evitar.

Cuántos no dijimos la frase "Ni el cliente sabe lo que quiere, menos lo voy a saber yo". Veamos como llevar esa frase a un proceso fluido, ameno y que dé como resultado un producto bello en todo aspecto. Drupal nos ofrece todo para poder contentar a cualquier tipo de clientes con un UI y UX de primera, así que analicemos casos de éxito en este aspecto.

	00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,380
Good afternoon.

00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,207
Let's start with this little chat.

00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:11,446
It is the fourth of the day, I think, no?

00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:13,756
Maybe you all are a little tired.

00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,703
Now let's talk a bit about UI and UX.

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,220
Although the focus is placed a little more on user experience.

00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,367
And we'll touch on the process of theming a bit more.

00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,686
I am Alberto Muñoz Junior Quiroga.

00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:39,489
I come from Bolivia.

00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:42,602
I work as a CEO in Koalasoft.

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,020
Alongside Osvaldo.

00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,671
We are partners and I take care of the administrative area, I also work as project manager.

00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,939
In most projects.

00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,081
Is a relatively small company so we still don't carry out many projects simultaneously.

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
We take on those that we can control amongst those who we are.

00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,167
There are really two of us who manage the projects.

00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,513
Koalasoft, in this picture there were ten 10 but now there are 12 of us.

00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,211
We are a new company, we started up almost a year ago.

00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:28,892
Before I was part of another company.

00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:30,650
I was basically a freelancer with several companies.

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Now Osvaldo and I are partners.

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Koalasoft is a company that I consider to have excellent developers.

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
The good thing about Koalasoft is that we focus our attention on the two areas,

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,885
both back end and front end.

00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,605
We are all specialists in an area.

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm more front end and Osvaldo's more back end.

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
We each manage our part of the work very well.

00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,585
To begin to recap this topic, why not talk a while about both UI and UX?

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:22,609
I remember when we worked before for a web development company 5 or 6 years ago

00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,655
The client wanted a website and we only presented a proposal,

00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:32,420
and if the client was satisfied, perfect.

00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,965
In most cases they were satisfied at least 70 or 80%.

00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,488
Using that we would start to make changes, improve development, and it would be ready.

00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:45,411
That was the development.

00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:51,012
Gradually this evolved as market needs were changing.

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,660
Depending on the size of the project, there comes a point where the user experience and interface,

00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,556
are perhaps even in some projects even more important than the development itself.

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,420
We are in an environment where social engineering, social relations, all that is social today,

00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,121
has led us to a point where not only do we have to have a good code, but also give the user a good interface.

00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,531
In addition to a good quality level of performance, all of which leads to a positive user experience.

00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,092
A pleasant user experience makes it so that,

00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,692
from the moment the user enters the page, they must be satisfied with it.

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
User satisfaction is not achieved through the user visiting and re-visiting the web.

00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,359
At least in most projects in which I participated, according to statistics in Google Analytics,

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,669
or anyone who provides us with statistics, 60 or 70% of users who return to a site,

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,970
do so because from the first entry they were satisfied with the performance of the page.

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
If they didn't experience such satisfaction from the first visit they made to our website, then they won't be coming back.

00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,902
Almost 70% of users that returned did so because the user experience was positive.

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
And the other 30% returned by accident or necessity.

00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,085
That happens often.

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,479
We return to a website because we really need something from that website.

00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,823
Not because we want to return to that site.

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
The user experience is often relative.

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,780
As the image shows, we know the phrase:

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,600
We're not going to reinvent the wheel.

00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,132
But the wheel has been improving.

00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,116
2000 years ago the wheel was not what it is today.

00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,996
Surely in 2000 years the wheel will not be like that which we have today.

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
That is the user experience.

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,060
Improve what is already invented.

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Make the user truly satisfied.

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,420
With websites it's the same.

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
This is a comparison between the CNN website 20 years ago,

00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,658
and CNN website yesterday.

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,020
When one visited the CNN site 20 years ago or 15 years ago,

00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,448
one found what we have in the first image.

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,130
And it looked good.

00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,239
It was enough.

00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,841
At that time, CNN was a news channel which we used to find out about the latest news.

00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,216
Period.

00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,454
But CNN now has not only multinational or similar competitors.

00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,261
It has social competitors.

00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,822
Facebook is one of the strongest competitors of CNN

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,669
because one finds out news through Facebook.

00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,881
CNN has to be updated to the current movement and provide the user with such an experience that the news also be social.

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I think CNN engineers want each article they publish to go viral.

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
They have to make it so that that news receives shares and gradually they can expand this market.

00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,066
We know that CNN has a large market in Latin America and North America.

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
But it's not going to stay there, they will continue to evolve.

00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,306
The user experience is not only through the Internet.

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It is the Internet through a cell phone, through SmartTV.

00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,715
Exploring in the store to buy a LG, the LG SmartTV app store, 

00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,538
I found a CNN application in which as you are watching TV, the news is being shown.

00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,005
You're watching football but you're finding out the news. 

00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,535
You no longer have to put on the CNN channel to watch the news.

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Today we have also seen important advances in the user experience.

00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,607
In interfaces.

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I think the responsive design is most evident that we all know.

00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,821
We all know that a while back, entering a web page from a cell

00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:28,321
meant one of two things,

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
either you had to zoom with your fingers until you got tired, or you had to enter the mobile page.

00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,023
For example the mobile page of a Bolivian newspaper is m.com.

00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,047
That has been changing.

00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,005
Most average users do not know that you had to put m rather than www.

00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,099
They always came across the traditional website 

00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:08,599
and ultimately could not use it.

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
We would hear that users often complained that from the cell could not navigate very well.

00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,462
And that their experience was negative.

00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,199
In the end, what they would do was enter only from their laptops or PCs and forget the phone.

00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,818
This is why elderly people could not adapt to navigating from a cell.

00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,548
This makes it so that one can enter in the same domain as www.com and m.com,

00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,221
and navigate in a mobile version without the necessity of a laptop.

00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:56,942
This improves the user experience.

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
The user does not know what engineering went into this.

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
But it is known that the user is now happy,

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,280
the average user is satisfied,

00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,373
even without being interested in knowing about the technology.

00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:18,463
And they're not going to be interested to know why in their phone it looks one way,

00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:19,400
and in their laptop another. 

00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:22,145
In the Smart TV or tablet it looks different. 

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Others wonder.

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,250
The engineering that lies behind this is what evolves.

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Another notable thing at the level of user experience these days is the integration with other systems.

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
And when the 2.0 and programming with user interaction came out,

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
what happened?

00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:52,977
The user had to log into certain pages.

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
What we were trying to do for the user was to promote the website.

00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,427
And to promote that the highest number of users possible entered this site.

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
But that advanced and reached the point where there are now 500 web sites that provide such services.

00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:16,655
500 for getting the best services.

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
And those offering other services.

00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,716
Every time we got to log in to a website,

00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,735
we had to fill out a form asking us our name, last name, city, date of birth.

00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,757
And fill out a form that bored us.

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,089
And then came Facebook.

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Facebook made us into developers offering our services 

00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,387
and people can log in with a simple click and view it on Facebook.

00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,405
That is the user experience.

00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:53,455
The user is now happy.

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They just log on to Facebook and they're already inside.

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
The same large form that we see at the level of development, 

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
the user thinks that the site no longer calls for a form.

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
It is a lie because we refer to Facebook and we fill that form out.

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
It did not improve.

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,825
It's not that we don't have the user data,

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
We simply ask for it from where we already know that they have it

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,709
That is the improvement of the user experience.

00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,085
Another important thing is the Internet platform.

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
It's a new phrase that starting this year will become very fashionable.

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
It is what until last year was known as Smartlife.

00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,809
Smart homes.

00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,441
It is a house that you get to and the GT automatically alerts you to what you have set.

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,470
And the cooler realizes and turns on the cooler screen.

00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,294
The GT gives notice to the air conditioning system that you are about to arrive and five minutes before you do,

00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,923
It is already conditioning the house.

00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,147
so that you no longer suffer the cold.

00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,361
There are many things like this.

00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,346
In January of this year, many new developments were presented in this regard in the TX in Las Vegas TX.

00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,446
The ones that most caught my attention were washers they know by means of the system

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
you have no clean clothes and the washer alerts you.

00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,758
When you get home you remember to do the wash.

00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,047
Very interesting stuff.

00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,449
They will improve the user experience.

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,089
Someone had to say to the washing machine to read the tweets.

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Who reads it, I myself.

00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,436
LG is taking measures in order for that to happen.

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Samsung is too.

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Watching TV is no longer the same as is was three or four years ago.

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Today watching a football game in high definition and with real-time statistics,

00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:34,274
and with the tweets that your friends are posting about the game you are seeing.

00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:34,774
It is not a novelty anymore.

00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,765
The applications for Smart TV have greatly improved.

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,310
Drupal obviously offers this to us.

00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,831
Starting with version 7 and version 8 for the services.

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
We will be able to, from our web system, offer that third parties read our information,

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,940
that we offer from our website.

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
and integrate various systems, home appliances, SmartWatch or tablets, etc.

00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,041
Communicate with our very lives and improve our daily experience.

00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,361
The daily experience is not only through the web, it is the user's life.

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
The process of developing a software program ultimately has these parts.

00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:50,963
What we do is interactive, a software program that we divide it into several smaller parts.

00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
It becomes interactive since everyone carries out an analysis, which is the part that will develop.

00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,931
We are developing it.

00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:01,800
We do quality control.

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
We integrate.

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,824
We have continuous integration.

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It integrates with what is being developed.

00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:14,343
And it goes into production when the customer is satisfied.

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
That becomes integrated.

00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,583
The analysis is perhaps the most important part of all, it is the pillar.

00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,133
It is the fundamental basis of all this integration.

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
When we start this cycle, it is because we have closed the previous cycle with client satisfaction. 

00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,714
If the previous cycle is not closed, we will not make a base in the subsequent cycle.

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
It's happened several times that the customer says to us:

00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,221
let's do one thing, we will continue to review the small details missing in this part,

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
but we need for you to start to develop this other part.

00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,222
We usually try to make it so that this does not happen.

00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,014
Instead that we make the integration step by step until the customer is satisfied.

00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,592
It has given good results.

00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,891
It is good advice.

00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:11,843
This part of the analysis is that we're touching on now.

00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,971
When do we analyze we do several things.

00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,880
Requirements analysis,

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
team development, 

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
we have enough people to carry out that development.

00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,739
The customer will be satisfied with these people.

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Something that is very good about Koalasoft is that we try to integrate people,

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,260
to have a direct relationship with the customer.

00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,984
It often happens that Osvaldo or I are the bumpers.

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Which when developers do not finish the work,

00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:50,614
we have to go to face up to the customer.

00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:55,187
Come forward and tell them that the dog ate their product.

00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:58,786
An obvious lie.

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
To prevent that the developer only sees us as the bad guys,

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
we try to involve them so that they go to give that excuse to the client.

00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,831
It is often better two days before the presentation,

00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,540
when one feels the pressure of going to face up to the customer, 

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,290
one says, we have to stay up all night,

00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,688
and we must finish the job.

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,809
But when the developer does not feel that pressure, 

00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,440
it could come out in a normal schedule, and it's ready.

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,660
Tomorrow I go back and nothing happened.

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
But when you feel you have to go tomorrow to show your face:

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,299
I also have to stay up all night.

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Team development is good.

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,540
The roles of the team.

00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,388
Not because we all have the same technical capacity,

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
will we fulfill the same roles in all projects.

00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,721
I may be project manager in one project,

00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:53,221
 

00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,205
but in another I'm just a front end developer.

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
In another one I will only manage it and communicate with the client.

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
These roles are becoming perfected.

00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,274
Each project is different.

00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,845
User interfaces that are negotiated with the client.

00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,283
And the part about user experience

00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:16,824
which is one of the most important.

00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,742
It's as we expect the end user to respond to our system.

00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,815
At this point it is important to also know that our client must be aware

00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,554
that the budget includes an analysis of user experience.

00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,316
Many times, it is not only asking ourselves who will be using the system.

00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,223
Children.

00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,200
In that case colorful sites, period.

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
That's not analyzing user experience.

00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,672
It it hiring people even from marketing and external consulting with other companies.

00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Carrying out surveys in the streets.

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,065
What they expect from a system.

00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,322
If the system we are developing is for a public institution,

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,059
and only going to be installed in intranet.

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Going to the company, surveying users.

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
the aims of the company.

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,740
They'll be satisfied.

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,786
What they expect from the system.

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
All this is in a budget.

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
If it takes 5 working days, a simple multiplication

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,462
and we know how much those five days cost us.

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
It's budget, it's not something we can skip.

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
The architecture of the software before entering into development.

00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,326
Something else that is also very important to consider:

00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,958
is that the UI, which is the design of user interfaces,

00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,458
is not the same as UX.

00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,366
Often the words go together.

00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,222
UI, UX even in Google searches is UI, UX.

00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,660
We always think they go together.

00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:08,174
It's really not the same.

00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,734
A pleasing website does not imply that the user has to have a good experience..

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
We will see why later.

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
What we do have to consider is who the end user is.

00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,757
Even if our client is, for example:

00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,208
a powerful company that designs toys,

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
and makes products for children, adolescents under 15 years.

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
That they will come to a website to look for toys,

00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
and end buyers are going to be parents, they put the data from the credit card.

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
If we are to guide children aged 14, 

00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,807
We can not allow the general manager of that company be 60 years old,

00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,451
to tell us how a 12 year-old child is going to behave.

00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:15,254
in regards to our website.

00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,063
Nor can we move on to another point.

00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:24,761
We are not going to bring a baby to use our system.

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
And tell us how it looks.

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
We have to strike a balance with the client,

00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,709
and if our company does not have the service,

00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,796
we make an external consultation in order to to make this type of survey.

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I will mention 7 Key aspects for a better user experienca.

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
These are not all of them, nor are they the 7 commandments.

00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
They are just seven points.

00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,360
There may be many more.

00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:05,612
Point number 1 is the customer is not always right. 

00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:06,660
The user is the one who decides.

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
We have always heard the famous phrase:

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,680
the customer is always right. 

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
As in the previous example, 

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,678
the client may not be the end user.

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Who will have the last word if our system provides a pleasant user experience, 

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,520
will be the end user.

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
For example, there are also systems oriented towards elderly individuals.

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
People who do not hear.

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Even people who do not see.

00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:46,192
Systems that integrate with certain types of other systems,

00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:49,124
that also provide different user experiences.

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
The end user who uses it is who has to tell us,

00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,356
through market analysis, through marketing surveys,

00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,605
and analysis of certain types, which is what we expect from that system.

00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:07,246
The customer is not always right.

00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:09,498
The end user is the one who decides.

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Two. 

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,900
That the system be well designed graphically

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,506
this does not mean that you are going to provide an amazing user experience.

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
That's what I mentioned to you all a while ago.

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
We simply say, for children they are colorful sites.

00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,642
For adults, they can be appealing.

00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:36,388
If you have noticed, Facebook, graphically, it doesn't have anything

00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:37,565
more than a blue bar above.

00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,747
When you display the sidebar, several options appear with some icons.

00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,208
But the graphics have nothing more.

00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,946
I don't believe that they are designers of mega Photoshop.

00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,207
Those who have made mockups of Facebook.

00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:02,605
What makes our Facebook user experience enjoyable.

00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:03,580
We are all connected on Facebook.

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,472
The content.

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Facebook knows that we are interested in the content.

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,640
To stay on their website.

00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,001
We don't always we have to break ourselves so that the interface is impressive,

00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:20,629
for the user to stay on our site.

00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,934
But we must know what the user is looking for on our site.

00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:29,663
Achieving this answer we will have guaranteed success.

00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
It's that simple.

00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,851
You must have seen cases in which the people are are especially good at designing,

00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,751
but do not know well the user experience, or of this kind of thing,

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
They puts banners in all their websites, in all the systems.

00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,348
Or sliders.

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Sliders are not necessary in all websites.

00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Perhaps in many cases, yes.

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Most corporate sites do have sliders.

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Imagine that every day when you enter Facebook, you are met with a slider with Mark Zuckerberg's face turning,

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,940
or some people looking at other people.

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,107
It's ridiculous.

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
We don't necessarily have to be great Photoshop designers to provide a good experience.

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
Simply to analyze the user interface necessary for our end user.

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Three.

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
A good user experience is one that does not often change dramatically. 

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
You must also know of websites you do not visit as often but every two or three months.

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
And each time you go to the website, the website has changed.

00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,595
You did not know where the start button was, you no longer know where was the form was, it had been redesigned.

00:26:58,046 --> 00:27:00,046
It is more beautiful than before, but now I can't find anything anymore.

00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,041
How beautiful, I review, I analyze the site, I like, I love it.

00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,835
I come back in three months and the design has changed again.

00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:14,513
It's nice, but what does it do?

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
The user often does not often return to the page.

00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,165
They will only return when they see fit or as needed.

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,140
It is the same case as Facebook.

00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:36,245
Those with Facebook over seven, eight years ago remember that Facebook

00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,520
was one thing a few years ago and a totally different thing now.

00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,623
In no one time have we felt that drastic change.

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
Except the time that they changed the biography in the user profile.

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
It was perhaps the only noticeable change in Facebook.

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Besides that we did not realize when they were changing things on Facebook.

00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,553
But if we compare our user interface on Facebook three or four years ago

00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,053
with the current, 

00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:02,527
it is totally different.

00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,276
Buttons have changed place,

00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:05,860
icons have changed.

00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:10,206
They have changed colors,

00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:11,860
they have changed the way the results are presented in the browser.

00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,180
They have presented new interfaces behind the platform.

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
The groups are no longer shown as before.

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,373
The pages are no longer shown as before.

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
At the time that this happened, we did not realize.

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
The changes have been happening.

00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
The site will evolve as time passes but not drastically.

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
The user experience has not changed.

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is easier to adapt to a button than to an entire interface.

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
We must take into account that the changes do not always have to be drastic in the system.

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,770
And not only button by button,

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,270
point by point,

00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,396
or page by page either.

00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,632
Four.

00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
The system that requires less user interaction is the most successful.

00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,217
It's something that I had already mentioned at the beginning.

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
It refers to that the systems today are requiring the user to do fewer things.

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
The user is tired.

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Imagine a user who lives in Manhattan, who walks everyday stressed out.

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Or a user who lives in Tokyo, where there are screens everywhere.

00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,126
Everything is electronic, everything jumps out at them.

00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:32,704
His head is bursting.

00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:36,911
One leaves work stressed out and the walk home is more stressful.

00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,820
When one comes home and wants to rest,

00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,157
one throws oneself into their bed, opens their tablet, and wants to check their Facebook,

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
or any other site.

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
This offers us a flat design.

00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:57,757
A lightweight design, a digestible design.

00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:04,006
A design that we can really rest our eyes when we look at it..

00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,320
It does not tire us.

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,519
It does not overwhelm us.

00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,632
It's not like the sites from before that when you got on there were animated GITs jumping everywhere.

00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:17,184
And bright stars.

00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:19,100
We already have that on the street.

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
On the street screens, advertisements, all kinds of things jump out at us.

00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,785
The less the website has and that it has only has what I need, that is what I'm looking for.

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
The less interaction, less tiring than the website, that's where I will be successful.

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
 

00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:50,134
Five is that people are very stressed.

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Don't let your system be another motive.

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Something I forgot to mention in the previous point

00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,120
is that systems nowadays also

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
if you all realize,

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,941
the vast majority are flat design.

00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:08,473
That's why.

00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,702
Because lately users have changed their way of seeing things.

00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:21,831
Some time ago logos, trademarks, everything was moving towards realism.

00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:26,138
The logos were becoming more and more three-dimensional.

00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,483
3D, they gave them shadowing, glows.

00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:39,593
Suddenly that also became a thing of the past and the Pepsi logo, and several others went back to being flat.

00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,001
As if they they passed an iron over top.

00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:42,793
And that is the new logo.

00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:48,064
All logos are flat.

00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Of the most famous brands.

00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:58,093
That will be changing slowly until the user gets tired of the flatness,

00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,754
and then go back to looking for realism.

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
The same thing happened with Apple.

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Steve Jobs was a fan of realism.

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Up to version 6 of IUS, which was the version when Steve Jobs died,

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
applications had realism.

00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:21,201
The icons were realistic, the Kiosk application was actually a kiosk, a showcase.

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Books were displayed in a realistic manner.

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Steve Jobs died and John Eath, the new head of design at Apple,

00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:37,508
changed everything and IUS 7 brought about the IUS design and now everything is flat.

00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,394
It is the user experience that is evolving.

00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,834
Six. 

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
The system must learn to deal with the user, not the user to deal with the system.

00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,096
I think many have heard the term expert systems.

00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:01,899
In Koalasoft we are good developing such systems. 

00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,218
An expert system is one that learns as time passes.

00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,962
It learns the user.

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
According to what the user is doing with the system.

00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,834
For example, we are developing an accounting system, 

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
in which the system learns how the user behaves,

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and it recommends the user certain things.

00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,066
Through notifications, for example, 

00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,946
if you use the system to manage your sales in a small shop,

00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,773
the system will tell you: 

00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:39,866
today you have to pay for electricity, or now you have to pay for water.

00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Last month you forgot to file your taxes.

00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,501
The system will be learning.

00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:49,187
Or it will be recommend you things saying:

00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,064
your sales fell yesterday and the day before compared to the average of last month.

00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
You should do marketing, for example.

00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,415
They are several types of systems where one goes about loading information to the system,

00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
and the system learns.

00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,276
Gradually, the system becomes more of an expert.

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
They are expert systems.

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
This is better at the level of user experience.

00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,852
For the user, e.g., when they have to use their calendar,

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
and it stores birthdays, one by one.

00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,892
Before you had to ask your friends one by one.

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
You would record the given day in your old cell that was not a Smartphone,

00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,820
and you would put: remember the birthday of so-and-so.

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Now what can you do.

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
With a simple synchronization, and another system, with your email, or with gmail,

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
with any email system you can know the birthdays of all your contacts.

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
The less interaction you have to have with the system 

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,128
and with one click fill all the birthdays of your contacts, 

00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,142
the better the experience.

00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,679
The user experience is not a design theme.

00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,608
This is the favorite point.

00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:25,464
I think many people confuse that the website has to be spectacularly well designed

00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,173
for the user to be happy.

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
A system that is very spectacularly designed,

00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,040
and takes 20 seconds to load, I won't return to.

00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,694
Insomuch as development, programmers as well as administrators must also do their part,

00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:47,025
and provide me with a website with high performance.

00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,541
That immediately can be connected to 500 users or 1000 users simultaneously.

00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,622
And the site does not become slow even if 500 or 1,000 or 20,000 are on it.

00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,559
The user experience will not only vary in design functionality.

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Depending on the design, performance, and productivity of each page loading.

00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,488
A how the data is presented.

00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,588
On the architecture of the content itself.

00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:24,735
We will slowly gather all of these so that the user can be truly satisfied.

00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:30,749
How can we engage the customer in this process.

00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:36,068
Throughout the process we have mentioned so far, 

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
it seems that everything is up to us.

00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
The customer pays us, and we come back in a week to show the product.

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
We come back in two weeks to show them again.

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
And the client often only has time for a one-day meeting.

00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,833
A few hours per day and does not want to meet any more.

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
For example, government institutions and large companies may place a person trained in our project.

00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:08,837
We have worked several times for public institutions,

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
and we have requested that at least eight hours a week, a person is dedicated to our project.

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,892
Exclusively. 

00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:26,778
That in their agenda within their institution, or within the company, they know clearly that person has meet with us

00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:27,880
and that is their job.

00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:35,569
With that we have achieved that the client can not only expect an email from us with the details of the system,

00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
but also that the client inserts a person who is obviously costing them money,

00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:48,822
but it will make it so that our system is much better.

00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,136
Because the feedback will be much more consistent.

00:37:57,894 --> 00:37:59,894
If the project is small, we should not forget this in the budget.

00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:01,489
What I had mentioned to you all.

00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,114
If the company with whom you are going to work is small,

00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,583
you must quote the project to the client including a detailed analysis that you will perform on user experience.

00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Often it is going to be an analysis of their own user experience,

00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,549
by the company itself, often it is going to be outsourced to another consultant.

00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,458
Do not forget, you have to include it in the budget.

00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Because if not, we will cause the system to become outdated when it has just come out.

00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:36,986
That has happened many times.

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
The Theming.

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,500
What do we do with the theming.

00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
The theming does not start when we start doing code.

00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,020
 

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,340
But rather from the moment of the signing of the contract.

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,260
I had mentioned to you all that the development process is analysis, requirements analysis, team analysis, and several points.

00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:04,604
In the end I was saying development.

00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:08,254
But that's not when it starts to do theming.

00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,153
The theming does not start when the developer has passed me what it is that I have to do,

00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,541
and now I start to program, and begin to make TPLs.

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
That has to start from the first meeting with the client,

00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,363
from knowing what the customer is expecting.

00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:29,795
In the first negotiation with the client,

00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:30,580
This is not going to get done, this is going to get done.

00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:34,426
If you say to the client: this is not going to get done, 

00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:36,201
it is because you have a better option.

00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,868
You are not going to say that it will not get done simply because I do not want to or because I could not.

00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,821
Because we have a better option for you.

00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:50,144
Keys to develop an excellent theme.

00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,620
The requirements have to be clear.

00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:58,757
User interfaces and have to be written.

00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,314
Not designed, but written.

00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:06,878
What we do is use Google Drive.

00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:12,521
To the client, from negotiations over what requirements the system wants,

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
we add a Google Drive a Doc and ask that them to fill out what he wants from the system.

00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,816
It usually takes two or three days to do this.

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Depending on the clients.

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
From then on, the features that will be our theme already come to mind.

00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,217
The technologies that we will use.

00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,261
As we are write the requirements we are already thinking down to what kind of server we will need.

00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:46,865
What kind of equipment we will need.

00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:50,526
That is clear.

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Very important in the part of requirements.

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Even the signing of the contract is the essential part, the core of the project.

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,660
It is the key to success.

00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,269
I don't know if you all recognize this image.

00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
It is widely shared in social networks at the level of development.

00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,175
These are typical requirements of not having agreed with the client.

00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,140
The client does not know what for, but they want to provide the end user a chair with three seats.

00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,646
With three stepping stones.

00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:32,800
What for.

00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:41,095
As this was unreal, the project leader was unable to understand.

00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
And could make the seat halfway.

00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
The design of the analyst, the approach of the programmer .

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Outside consultants always come.

00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,991
They say to us: you have to provide something marvelous to the customer.

00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:58,066
But it is not what the client is needing

00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:00,312
Much less the end user.

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Nobody goes to a park to find a swing that is a couch.

00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,107
Nobody does.

00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:13,880
This is the part of requirements.

00:42:14,274 --> 00:42:16,274
We have to define them very well.

00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,536
The second aspect is the wire frames.

00:42:22,146 --> 00:42:24,146
The sketches of how the content within the website will distribute.

00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,260
There are those who prefer to do this with software specialized in wire frames.

00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
What I recommend and prefer is to grab a notepad and make wire frames by hand.

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,111
Together with the client.

00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
As I mentioned, if the client provides us with a person who can be with us exclusively for at least 8 hours a week,

00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:58,002
four or six hours of those 8, we could dedicate to the first week of the project

00:42:58,002 --> 00:42:59,345
to make wire frames.

00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:01,290
With the client.

00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,019
How you all distribute your content.

00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
We are those who know the most about this.

00:43:11,895 --> 00:43:13,895
The customer through their requirements is going to tell us how they want to distribute their content.

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
And once all the wire frames, all the screens are well designed,

00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:27,618
we can sign a consensus with the client in which we can move from wire frames to graphic design.

00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:29,056
To the mock ups.

00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:37,461
It is very important that the client knows that consensus has been come from both sides.

00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:39,359
That is what we do.

00:43:42,221 --> 00:43:44,221
The customer is pleased with the wire frames, perfect, then it gets passed to the mock ups.

00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,957
When we are in mock ups we no longer return to wire frames.

00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:52,706
Why would we be doing mock ups if not, it would be a mess.

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
What we do is if there are improvements, obviously these will be negotiated in as the project grows.

00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,579
The mock ups, graphic design is often already targeted, or in Photoshop.

00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,714
Illustrator, Scape and software programs that the designers prefer.

00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
They have to be 100% functional, and they can not be missing any items.

00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
The designer can not ignore any item that is missing.

00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:32,444
It must have accurate measurements down to the font.

00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Very detailed.

00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:41,912
It must be fully functional for developers.

00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Also, the designer does not know and is not going to meet with the developer.

00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:59,367
Therefore, the developer must submit fully functional mock ups so developers do not have to,

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
at any time knock on the door of the designer and say: what was this part?

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
What was it called?

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,603
What should this icon be like?

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,520
The designer must be fully capable of giving the developer all of the elements of the site.

00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,740
Prototypes of the animations.

00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:24,652
Many times we make animations in Javascript or scrolls.

00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:26,318
Or as certain content appears, etc.

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
The designers also make these with certain types of programs.

00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:37,697
Some designers still use Flash.

00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:39,630
I think it is easier to do it in Flash.

00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:44,243
And developers take on the responsibility of converting Flash to Javasript.

00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:47,808
We already have the prototypes.

00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,567
We make an analysis of the resources.

00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,507
Where is all of this going to take us?

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,180
Resources in terms of personnel, human resources, and institutional levels.

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,899
How long is going to take us?

00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
How much is it going to cost us?

00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:07,456
The budget has been adequate.

00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,280
From there we go on to development.

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
A layout and development of the theme itself.

00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
Many times there are software programs that provide us full html from prototype.

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,260
The developer already has the html.

00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,590
From the Html it is very easy to go to TPLs.

00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,729
We prefer Foundation.

00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,125
SAS or sometimes we use Lesk.

00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:47,895
And for last of all, we leave the Javascripts.

00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:51,553
With that, we guarantee that it will be good process.

00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,900
We return to touch on that aspect, that all these points have been interactive with the client,

00:47:06,102 --> 00:47:08,102
We have not appeared with the development of the theme after having signed the requirements.

00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,962
The client must be agree and be satisfied with each aspect.

00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,540
There is a phrase that I love:

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that says the user experience is reflected in the user's expression.

00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Any system that we are going to develop, 

00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
what the end user says to our system, either to ourselves or to third parties,

00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
that's what is going to be valued for the reputation of both the developers and business.

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
And as the system itself, so that it may grow.

00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,569
In the end, the best experience is that in which the user feels, in which the user speaks and shares with other people.

00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
Questions.

00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,840
No. 

00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,976
The user experience is how the user behaves with the page.

00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:18,174
The architecture of the website is only the interface.

00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:21,915
It is the difference between UI and UX.

00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,420
What you say is UI.

00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,719
If you have a giant form, that is the interface.

00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:30,115
You are not going to be able to change it.

00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
That same form, if you present it in colors, and you present it in black and white,

00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:42,987
It is the same form, it asks for the same data.

00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
But colors may make it more fun for the user.

00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,320
The experience is better.

00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:53,013
The same website is used.

00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:21,565
One good and one bad experience.

00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:23,540
I will touch on both.

00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,540
The bad first.

00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,980
We had a case when we were just starting out,

00:50:32,854 --> 00:50:34,854
we developed an inventory system with Drupal

00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:36,775
and we did not communicate well with the cliente.

00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,260
It was a serious error.

00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:45,716
We knew we had to install the system on an intranet,

00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,201
we knew several aspects but no very deep details.

00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:52,996
When we went to the client with the finished product and the inventory system,

00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,260
At least in our laptops each page took three to four seconds to load.

00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,553
The heaviest views.

00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:02,300
It was local.

00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,740
It loaded fast, but it took three or four seconds.

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
It wasn't instant like other inventory systems.

00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,860
It turned out that the client told us: perfect, install me the system.

00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,540
I have three computers with WindowsXP.

00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,040
 

00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:21,632
With a gig of RAM each.

00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:23,320
I think they may even have two.

00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:31,452
We looked at each other, we installed the system and each page that in our laptops loaded in 4 seconds,

00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:34,581
loaded in 25, 30, 35 seconds.

00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,480
It was a disaster.

00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,940
Why didn't we consult how it would be technically.

00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
If its fully valid, one must assess everything when making the contract.

00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,299
The technical aspects.

00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,951
Performing a not so full study, because it can not be done.

00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:01,381
But as fully as possible.

00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
In Drupal, Debel helps a lot, and gives them the greatest amount of contents possible,

00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,352
while thousands and thousand improve so that the page does not become slow.

00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:20,134
It is exactly like something I was saying.

00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:26,108
To go back to a flat logo, for example, is obviously not only going back to flat, period.

00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,830
Last year the logo of year, which I loved was that of AB & B.

00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,664
It is an A as they call it, they have their own name, their logo.

00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:46,773
I loved it because it is totally simple but to get to that, 

00:53:47,498 --> 00:53:49,498
that have initiated the process we will not see.

00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
But we that we'll like, we like it.

00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,982
I am not saying that behind this simplicity there is no complexity.

00:53:57,982 --> 00:53:59,432
There is and plenty of it.

00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,667
The average user no longer sees that complexity.

00:54:41,888 --> 00:54:43,888
At least I don't know an automated one.

00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:47,873
If it were something that was automated, it would have to be an expert system that behaved like a person.

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
And at the same time, the same system would have to be like many people.

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
The only thing that we have done is surveys.

00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:09,199
Once the system has already been made into a prototype, there are many end user surveys and feedback that the system will have.

00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:23,154
And also when the system is in production, it is a little easier.

00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:26,797
There are even systems that are similar to analytics. 

00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:27,720
The ones I like are those in color.

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
Where the user has moved the mouse.

00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:33,674
They scrolled.

00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,360
They just scrolled and left the page or returned.

00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,840
Or in what part they stayed the longest.

00:56:40,686 --> 00:56:42,686
Or from the homepage they went to what page

00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,417
If from the homepage they went straight to the contact and made the contact and the page is a success.

00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,460
But if I had to read all the pages.

00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Those types of systems are good but for sites in production.

00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,480
In our case, as I mentioned that our case was itneractive,

00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,883
then we just utilize them as testers of the part we have developed.

00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
A good practice we have is that we are three development teams, everyone is into a different project,

00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,360
and an afternoon or a couple of hours a week we do crossover projects 

00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:57,798
and those that are in in this project will use what they developed.

00:57:57,798 --> 00:57:59,380
And vice versa.

00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,300
At least it's a little more feedback amonst ourselves

00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,079
but it is so little.

00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,780
To the end user it's already complete obviously of the complete interaction.

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Of the entire system when its already going to be put into production for the end users.

00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:59,738
We have not yet had clients asking us for an aggressive popup.

00:59:02,026 --> 00:59:04,026
 But I consider that such pages have a clear objective.

00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:06,861
Their goal is to gain users and make money with users.

00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:08,240
The number of users they may have.

00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
If their goal is clear towards this conversion, 

00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,479
they will do whatever possible so that it to does that.

00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:19,689
The same happens with download sites.

00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:22,761
Before it was a download link, period.

00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:27,953
But one now enters a download site and 20 download links appear, 19 of which are advertising.

00:59:33,594 --> 00:59:35,594
The website wants one to make a mistake and click on the wrong download link,

00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,671
because it generates money.

00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,780
I am not fond of that kind of way to attract customers, but unfortunately it is valid today.

00:59:48,028 --> 00:59:50,028
It is not penalized.

00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,688
Sure, it's annoying.

00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:56,755
It's a bad experience.

01:00:04,153 --> 01:00:06,153
It is interesting that point of view because many sites that offer advertising on Google

01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
have an interest in that people click on the ads and they can make money on Google.

01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,740
Ad block can block all advertisements and viola.

01:00:22,238 --> 01:00:24,238
That generates many losses for Google but it's a good user experience.

01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:33,418
