	Speakers: dagmita
SEO is tremendously important in the Internet attention competition. Not all websites use their potential to appear amongst the top search results. SEO needs to be considered from the very beginning of the project. There are some architectural principles to follow. Furthermore many optimizations should be done along the way. Last year we have founded our sister company Amazee Metrics which focuses on SEO, SEM, Web Analytics and Online Marketing. We are working together hand in hand to increase our client's reach and conversions. I will give hands on tipps for Drupal as well as practical advice for those who manage stakeholders.

search engine marketing and we're really

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,109
working very closely on our projects we

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,330
integrate them really well and that's

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,580
why I wanted to give this talk today to

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,970
explain you what we are doing in the

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:28,650
area of SEO so let's get started and

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,740
first of all I will quickly explain what

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,090
and why SEO why is it so important then

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,550
I would like to give you a big picture

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,489
and present the SEO process that we

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,860
apply ad amazing metrics then I will go

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,890
into the more technical stuff explaining

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,100
what is in core and what modules we use

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:52,079
and give you an update on Drupal 8 and

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,460
then conclude the session so yeah first

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,289
point what and why SEO and there's SEO

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:04,580
and sem SEO is the optimization of your

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,710
visibility in the organic search results

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:12,330
the organic search results is the red

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:16,590
area you see here and it is um yeah what

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,220
is not paid by Edwards ads and it comes

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,320
like below some of the Edwards and on

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,770
the right side there's also more ads and

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,659
this blue areas is called sem search

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,520
engine marketing so what is it what is

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,950
actually the the difference between the

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,369
two SEO is not directly paid and you try

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,040
to get on the first positions by

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:46,439
creating like by a lot of activities you

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,899
will do on the long run so it's a it has

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,390
a long-term impact and it's also not

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,820
very immediate you have to do it at

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,820
least four to six months to get some

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,430
kind of results so be patient if you do

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,189
SEO but it also lasts very long so you

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,430
start with a lot of effort and then it

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,520
has a plateau so you benefit on the long

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,910
term from it sem on the other hand is

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,319
very short term very temporary so you

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,129
buy some Edwards

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,129
on Google you appear in this very good

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,109
position on the top search results you

00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,180
get a lot of clicks but as soon as you

00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:26,129
stop paying you will not appear anymore

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,060
and you will not have any impact anymore

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:33,930
so we always a chance to do both like if

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,969
you have a seasonal business do seasonal

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,180
ads when you have high seas news with

00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:43,319
Edwards but for the long run for always

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:50,669
the big for increasing on the long term

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:53,430
to SEO so why is it actually so

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:56,219
important to be on the first results on

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,560
search engines like Google we see here

00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,560
this is a click analysis and you see

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
people click according to the f that we

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,000
know also from websites so they start on

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,250
the top left they go a little bit to

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,250
write they go to the left again they go

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,870
a bit and below and they they go a

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,199
little to the right again and below

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,540
again but they stay in the first i would

00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,349
say in the first third of the page they

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,060
don't not all users go go below because

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,290
they have to scroll so this is the first

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,970
what they see and what they look at

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,919
that's why it's really important you

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,500
optimize your site to be on the top

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:37,319
three positions this is actually also

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,379
proven by numbers so as you see here the

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,409
first three results get one hundred

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,900
percent of the user attention and the

00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,359
further you go go low on the on the

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,609
results you get less awareness less

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,639
attention so that's why it's really

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,590
important to be amongst the top three

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,949
then what is with another with the

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,079
different with another search pages and

00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,540
you see sixty-two percent of the users

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,269
only look at the very first page they

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,689
don't they don't click on further pages

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:13,400
and also what is the difference between

00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,629
organic and edwards organic and sem

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,949
sixty-seven percent of users actually

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:22,590
prefer organic search results so you

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,219
will have on long-term more success with

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,219
sem

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:34,710
yeah I don't know who has done SEO

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,860
measures in the past okay few people

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,440
have so this light might not be so

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,540
important for you but I'll explain you

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,120
anyways there has been an old way of

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,600
doing SEO and there's a new way of doing

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,150
SEO and what is important to understand

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,810
is that search engines like Google or

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,020
Bing they try two more in more act as a

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,410
human they try to act as us as the users

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,690
because they would like to optimize the

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,180
search experience for the users that

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,740
what would like to provide the best user

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,900
experience and that's why I try to they

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,870
try to analyze the usability of the

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:21,870
website they try to yeah and see what

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:26,669
how you gonna act on this side so today

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,130
and you have to do measures like content

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,500
increase you have to create a lot of

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,990
content you have to increase your social

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,850
media visibility it like you have to do

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,560
everything that is benefiting the user

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:43,080
in the past what SEO experts try to do

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
they right right to to optimize for the

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,960
machines they try to optimize for the

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,820
search engine machines and this while in

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,550
the past we know a lot about article

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,680
spinning or keyword stuffing like just

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,050
put on the footer of your page put

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,750
thousands of keywords etc but this

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,940
doesn't help anymore today it's really

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:07,919
about creating a long-term good content

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:12,120
strategy and SEO strategy so how do we

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:18,600
do that that leads me to the second

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:21,240
point SEO process so as your process the

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,070
whole big picture is a very

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,710
multidisciplinary expertise it's not

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,690
only Codding it's not only technical it

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,020
has to go hand in hand together with the

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,960
content creators so that's why on the

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,940
first step we don't we don't look at the

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,550
website we look outside

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,610
of the website like first of all we do a

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,400
Content a keyword analysis what are

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,970
keywords that are interesting for your

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,310
domain for your industry like for drupal

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,420
agency its Drupal its web development

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,430
its design etc so we look at these

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,560
keywords then we do a competitive

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,490
analysis who is on the market with you

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,850
is it a very peddled market which

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,920
keywords have still potential etc and

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,880
then you look at how you are present on

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:20,310
the social media channels so this all

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,260
includes non technical stuff and the the

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,860
outcome of this analysis is a SEO

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,890
strategy so what you what do you have to

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,780
do in future how is your status today

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:33,660
where you want to go and how do you get

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,370
there and it's also and keywords are

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,480
playing a very important role in that

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:41,940
and this is why also the definition of

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,710
the SEO relevant keywords come out of

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:50,090
this analysis as well then as a second

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,630
step it is getting more technical you do

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:57,840
on site audit and this on-site ordered

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,640
comprises the technical audit of your

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,190
website of your Drupal website is

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,290
everything there that that search

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,290
engines need and we will go into details

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:11,100
later about that it also includes mobile

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:13,290
they're like Google is now more and more

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,180
considering also mobile factors for your

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,030
ranking they have different ranking on

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,980
mobile and desktop and yeah it's index

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,900
in audit and as I said also usability

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,730
audit like search engines can now track

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,110
in a certain way your usability of your

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:34,589
website so if this is done usually the

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,479
web site goes live and there's a third

00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,180
continuous SEO step it's really

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,300
important to to have than a repeated

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,280
repetitive strategy where you create

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,250
content where you always check your

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,810
success and and see that the numbers are

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:54,210
going up so how does this

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,750
go together with the development of a

00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:00,390
new website so and that's the plan that

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,180
we follow it's a first step we need to

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,770
define the goals what is what is the

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,350
goal of the client or what is the goal

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,810
of that you have with your website is it

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,300
a do you like to have leads for your

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,110
agency do you like to have people read

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,390
your blog content do you like to have

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,470
traffic increase and then based of these

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:24,510
based on these goals we do and go to do

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,400
the off site analysis that I've already

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:30,210
explained you where we then have a

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,210
strategy and keywords and as a second

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,370
step and we do the content strategy how

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,100
do you get this content in which content

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,810
is it in which ways and this goes hand

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,529
in hand with a definition of the

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,520
features you need for example you need a

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:50,150
content that is you need content that

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,120
comes in regularly so you might have a

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,130
blog feature you need you have white

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,500
papers okay so you need a white white

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,770
paper section on your website so these

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,990
two really go hand in hand and as soon

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,700
as this is done we do implementation of

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,420
all that stuff and short before the go

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,280
life we do the on-site analysis and then

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,170
if thats its also positively to the

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,600
Goliath and afterwards as a continuous

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,430
improvement for one side SEO steps and

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:24,089
for the other side of optimizations on

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:27,089
the website itself sure go live it's a

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,339
when you release your website like let's

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,410
say you don't have a website yet you do

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,890
a new one and at some point you release

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,220
it you go live right so in this is

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,220
system

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,459
good that was not a big picture and now

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,079
let's let's dive into what is what is

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:53,430
there to be done on the technical area

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:57,100
so what is there in core almost nothing

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,160
so you have to work a lot a lot with the

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,170
modules that are there what you have is

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,420
like the very basics like you have a no

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,649
title and h1 and you have the

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,050
possibility to define SEO friendly urls

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:15,190
but it's not enough and for drupal 8

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,319
it's the same so that's why i'm now

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:24,459
going to show you the modules we're

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:27,610
using so first of all what you would

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:29,709
like to consider is a set a tracking

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,720
tool because you would like to measure

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,490
your success right you want to see if

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,839
the numbers are going up actually and

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:41,319
you want to see your if your funnels are

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,480
successful so and we usually use Google

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:47,079
Analytics it has become the standard

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,540
tool and we integrated by adding the

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:55,860
universal analytics code via the Google

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:58,930
Analytics module then next thing and the

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,209
robots.txt file needs to exist so that

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,550
search engine can crawl actually the

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:07,449
right content you can exclude things

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:10,120
into in the robots.txt file and what

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:15,940
happened to us in the in the past that

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,550
we want edit the disallow comment on the

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,579
left side and we forgot to take it out

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:24,730
so just check before you go live if the

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:31,510
robots.txt file exists otherwise no

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:34,540
traffic then you need a XML sitemap so

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,959
that search engines know how to crawl

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,630
your website intelligently you help

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:44,500
search engines with a width emm xml

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,380
sitemap and there's a module for that so

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:52,319
just it install the XML sitemap module

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,319
and add sitemap to the Royal Box TX

00:12:55,109 --> 00:13:05,229
so a big big topic are the URL structure

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:07,629
and the redirects so the rule is that

00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:10,599
URL should be readable that should be

00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:12,849
user friendly and they should include

00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:15,339
very important keywords because this is

00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:16,869
also a vector for search engines they

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,719
should not be too long they should be

00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:22,059
maximum 100 characters long and you

00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:24,909
should use slashes to separate between

00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,489
categories and subcategories so here

00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:29,679
I've had I have added a good an example

00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:34,209
how it should look in the ideal world

00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,969
and you see also what Drupal delivers as

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,339
a standard it's an old ideas so this

00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:41,019
doesn't give the user really good

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,149
information and it doesn't have really

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,489
search engines that's why you would like

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:51,429
to make this if you were else look

00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:55,299
better and for this to achieve this goal

00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:56,919
you use the path outer module and what

00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:02,499
it does is it allows you to

00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:07,089
automatically define URL path aliases /

00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:10,599
file / content i protec sonometer per

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,569
user and / language so you don't have to

00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:16,869
add you don't your content editors don't

00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:20,129
have to add the dahlias by themselves

00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:24,159
manually but the system is creating the

00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:26,799
URL aliette automatically for example

00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:31,119
out of out of a content type you usually

00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:33,399
use the no title and I've also added a

00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:36,249
screenshot how this looks in in Drupal

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,009
how you can configure it and there's a

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:41,859
field our taxonomy term so it makes

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:44,429
total sense to say ok the the first

00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:47,229
alias is the taxonomy term and then

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:49,709
sorry the vocabulary name and then the

00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,709
turn name

00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:00,179
good yeah and yeah you see here also an

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,639
example that is good you have news as a

00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,639
category and then you have the no title

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:11,399
so then you need to ensure that that

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,779
your nice URLs are also showing an hour

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:18,329
probably redirected and and you should

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:22,949
also see that you have the least

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:25,739
possible 302 and redirect as possible

00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:28,589
these are non permanent so this is not

00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:31,739
so good to have and the global redirect

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,470
module is the thing you have to use it

00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:35,999
checks your current user URL for an ally

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,170
us and then each other it doesn't

00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:43,079
redirect to it I think this is pretty

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,899
basic there's one thing you really have

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:51,299
to pay attention to is that you that you

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:53,579
set the redirect from www to a non www

00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,679
redirect because and you have to do that

00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:58,679
on the live server because if you have

00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,019
if you don't do the redirect Google

00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,269
looks at this two sides like separate

00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,419
sites and you lose a lot of your ranking

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:10,559
power due to that and it's also annoying

00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:16,220
for users if they don't can do that can

00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:22,079
edit leave you or not and yeah so

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:25,739
another topic for your else's yeah when

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:31,350
you use facet API and you use filtered

00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:33,089
searches per default your Drupal your

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,089
you always look like this you have a lot

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,559
of percentages and stuff in there it's

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,899
really long and it's not very readable

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,819
so what you would like to have there as

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:47,970
well the readable and user-friendly

00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:50,819
world so in this case you use the facet

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,249
API pretty pass module that here your

00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:56,399
self road and it's trying to raise the

00:16:53,249 --> 00:17:01,740
Knights us such as like alias and while

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,259
you and we have an example here you see

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,209
there are

00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:11,079
in this in this URL you see really nice

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:14,709
readable things in there it's much

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,360
better than the many percentages I will

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,669
also put this lights on SlideShare you

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:26,350
so you don't have to know it everything

00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:28,630
down good another topic is for sure

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:31,630
multilingual URLs I guess for you also

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,639
multilingual is also big topic they

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,370
should also look good with room Roman

00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:41,740
letters and you use the transitory

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,799
transliteration module for this and it

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,850
takes Unicode text and represents it in

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,519
us as key codes um here you see a nice

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,399
example like you see here a lot of

00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,710
special characters in this and there's

00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:05,740
no title but they don't appear actually

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:09,070
in the euro okay now that was all about

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,590
yours and redirect and now we come to a

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,899
really important topic that's a tiger

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,960
tag and made her description tag who is

00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:19,960
with installing meta tag modules on

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,990
their website okay good most of you so

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,120
yeah and you have to make sure that you

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,460
have a title tag and it appears on the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:33,899
browser tab and you have to ensure that

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:36,850
you have the middle description tag and

00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:39,879
you can also like what is also important

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,309
that you activate it also for views and

00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:44,169
panels if you're using them because

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:47,080
these are mainly very important pages

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,929
you want Google to find and you want

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,870
them to optimize so you have their sub

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:58,000
modules meta tag views and meta tag

00:18:52,870 --> 00:19:00,760
panels and the meta tag module has also

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,710
very other further functionalities you

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,120
can go really deep into that another

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,500
example is the Open Graph settings that

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,169
is helping you to have really nice

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,389
representation on Facebook is if someone

00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:16,169
is sharing link on facebook from you so

00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:24,119
you're also enabled the sub-module

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:26,580
to take Open Graph yeah okay this is an

00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,289
example how it looks like and this is

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,879
basically an example of how you have to

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,309
integrate with your with your content

00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:35,159
editors because you can install this

00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:37,230
nice modules but if the content area is

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,580
not are not taking care of that it

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:43,889
doesn't help a lot especially like I

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,739
don't know if you have it a bit if it

00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:50,340
happens for you too but sometimes we

00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:53,070
don't have a summary on on a content

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:58,139
type so then you have to instruct your

00:19:53,070 --> 00:20:01,590
users to go to the meta tags and to feel

00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:05,330
that this out on a node it's also

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,330
important that you let you stick with

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:12,809
150 to 160 characters if you have much

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:15,840
less user takes whatever he want

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:18,179
whatever it wants like or it's something

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,600
and if you have much if you have too

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,609
much it takes also the part they like so

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:31,019
it's really important to stick with with

00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:33,359
the with the character limits here yeah

00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:36,899
so that you will that you also be found

00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:40,950
on the image search you should instruct

00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:44,190
your content editors to add the alt text

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,470
on images they upload and for this

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,139
purpose you you don't need a module but

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,159
you need to activate the alt tag on the

00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,159
field configuration

00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:01,269
and this is how it looks I think most of

00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:03,730
you know that yeah also here it is not

00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:06,399
enough to just enable this but it's also

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,080
you also need to train the content

00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,879
editors to feel that actually out and

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,590
show them the benefits that get out of

00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:19,899
that then it can happen that you have

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:24,549
things you would like to hide like in

00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:26,109
our case we we have some we have some

00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,919
constant times where we don't want to

00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:31,960
show the full note view for example

00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,450
events is a is a topic that is coming up

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,149
again and again so events have so little

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,330
information that they don't have a full

00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:43,570
note view they appear only on the view

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,909
as a view mode so in this case you don't

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,580
you want Google to her you want to hide

00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:52,480
the full note from google and therefore

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,190
we use a rapid whole module and that you

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,539
can happen watch there you can define

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,299
what should happen when you are

00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:03,029
accessing the full of view and you can

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:03,029
then say redirect to the overview page

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:13,179
yeah a big big topic page load speed

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:15,850
performance the goal is that that you

00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:20,619
have a super high performance of your

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:23,710
website desktop and mobile this is very

00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:26,549
important and google recommends like one

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,320
second or 1.4 seconds it's not so clear

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:32,200
but it's at least it has to be really

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,590
fast what we are usually doing that we

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,409
use a Google PageSpeed insights tool and

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,259
there are lots of other tools around but

00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:43,749
I mean you want to be found on google so

00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,730
you can also use a Google tool to to see

00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:49,179
what they think your performances and

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:53,049
they give you also tips on what to what

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:55,330
you improve so this is a good tool and

00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:57,789
the whole performance area is for sure

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:00,629
another topic so I don't go into further

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,629
details there

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,660
yeah then there is a little thing you

00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,950
should look at is the aggregation of

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,930
Travis script files and yeah / default

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:18,100
JavaScript files are excluded from the

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:20,470
robots.txt file and Google can then not

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,020
find this content so just have a look

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,700
that when you go live let the JavaScript

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:32,260
abrogate arisen a table during the

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:36,910
launch and not to forget so yeah this

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:40,030
was all the modules we were using um I

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:43,900
build up the slides according to how we

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:46,570
check everything so we have a checklist

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,400
before go life and we go through all

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,310
these points and look how they're

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,700
fulfilled is it is the meta text module

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,400
installed other redirects working well

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,760
is pass out to working so i recommend

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,620
you to download the presentation and go

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:09,820
through these points when you when you

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:13,090
launch a website yeah um yeah what is

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,700
the state of modules in d8i at the

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:19,110
beginning I was checking the status of

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,610
each module and some modules are really

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,580
really far already like the global

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:28,360
redirect module and paths auto there are

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,770
already versions available for sure

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,320
doesn't they are not finished because

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,530
Drupal is always changing still and

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,380
there are lots of modules like rabbit

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:40,990
hole that are not even started so but it

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,720
was really hard for me to get the the

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,380
update and if you're interested to help

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,630
I think you should go to the web to the

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,940
the pages of each of the modules and

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:56,070
check the status and get in contact with

00:24:51,940 --> 00:25:00,670
with one of these or with the maintainer

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,680
in my opinion as your modules are really

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,040
important for the first step off of

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,990
Drupal 8 because it's for me this is

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,760
part of the of the basics you have to

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,760
have for launching a website

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:23,390
yeah so now we come to my conclusions

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:28,130
and in our agency SEO is a fixed

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:31,670
building part so we tell outlines that

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,070
they have to have this they have to have

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,500
the the SEO optimizations they should

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,480
have the off site analysis and we really

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,820
like we are really working tightly

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,310
together with our company amazing

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,320
metrics because it doesn't really help

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,290
then you have a really fancy website but

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,360
no one is finding it and and if you

00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,090
define the goal together with the client

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,510
it's always about increasing traffic

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,900
increasing leads and it's not only with

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:05,840
fancy features but it's mainly also with

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,060
being found so you should also do SEO

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,350
from the start on because it has some

00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:15,890
architectural specificities that you

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:19,100
have to consider so it is a pain in the

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,780
ass if you have to do it afterwards for

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,470
your content editors they have to go to

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,450
every node and and and add a meta

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,220
description or something like that so

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,110
from that point it is really hard and

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,720
also from the point of the site building

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,880
it's it's hard to do it afterwards so

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,930
try to really consider these things from

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,510
the very beginning on um we have decided

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:45,260
two years ago to have a separate company

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,680
that is dealing with SEO because we

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,140
think it is an expertise by itself it's

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,660
like it's ever and always changing

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,140
environment like Google is constantly

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,000
changing their algorithms and you have

00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,680
to have someone that is really on to on

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,170
top of this and it also is not only

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:10,940
technical it's also like lot of content

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:14,780
and content related so it needs a

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:18,500
specific person or a specific expertise

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:22,120
so if you can afford it have a chef a

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,120
person that is an expert in that

00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:28,200
yeah as I said also at the beginning we

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:32,440
recommend doing SEO and SEM both in

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,019
parallel that that means SEO is if the

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,769
basis is is the one that is has a

00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:42,340
long-term effect and sem is more the

00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:46,389
temporary and campaign related measure

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:48,279
you take yeah i have mentioned it also a

00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:51,730
lot the last point it's

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,820
multidisciplinary it is it is it has a

00:27:51,730 --> 00:28:00,850
techie part and it has also a marketing

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:02,409
and content and publishing part so you

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,110
should have through you should consider

00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:08,499
and work together tightly with with

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:12,090
other areas of your of your companies or

00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:16,600
whether come all with your customer yeah

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:26,289
this was it already so thanks for

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:29,190
listening and your questions do you

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:36,029
recommend the rabbit hole a module

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:41,789
because showing blank and it ended its

00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:48,580
hearts the SEO for my site or because is

00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:50,799
unpleasant to see blank pages it's it's

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:55,659
not very pleasant for your user that is

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,789
a that is the point you will have a full

00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:00,490
node view that is not theme that looks

00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:02,619
really strange so the most probably user

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:08,889
will go over and think oh that site is

00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:15,360
broken no doesn't really hurt your

00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:15,360
ranking okay oh okay

00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:21,089
hi is there an alternative model for

00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,179
meditech because we are having a problem

00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:26,789
with custom-made attacked like good news

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,129
for example that requires some coastal

00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:34,109
meta tags that they made a touch model

00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:38,609
it doesn't let you add for example or co

00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:41,909
or a I think they laid you a cost is to

00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:44,909
customize open graph meta tags for

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:47,489
facebook but what if there there's a new

00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,950
social network that you did you want to

00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:59,969
add but you don't want to wait for the

00:29:49,950 --> 00:30:03,450
model to release well the meta tag

00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:05,519
module itself provides an API so if the

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,559
integration is not there yet for example

00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,139
let's say we have a new social network

00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,059
that requires or when Twitter cards came

00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:14,460
out the good thing in the Drupal

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,830
community we will have somebody make

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,169
that integration really fast but if we

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,109
do not have the api's are there so any

00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,969
any of your developers could actually

00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:26,039
write that integration with with based

00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:28,049
on the Metro tech module or for example

00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,239
for the amazing lab super late side we

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:32,759
didn't have it available so we just

00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:36,179
added the meta text on our own in the

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,889
theme layer that's also possible yeah I

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,539
think it's really the strength of open

00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:41,190
source that we are one of the first

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:43,320
adopting this because someone in the

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:49,889
community has the same as the same

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:52,200
problem so anyone thanks first all I'll

00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,700
comment on your question is I'm glad to

00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,450
find out about rabbit hole because I

00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:00,059
have one page that it's just only a view

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,549
at one of and so the nodes that are used

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,869
to create the view our unstyled I don't

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,979
laugh when I have to work on them they

00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:07,589
don't make any sense I don't want

00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:11,440
anybody to see them so that's like a

00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:15,789
great use case for but my question was

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,500
for multi sites if there's two you have

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,889
two domains that want to share some

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,809
content are there any SEO problems with

00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:24,549
that and anything that Drupal can do to

00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:27,039
to help with that for instance I've

00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,960
heard that Google doesn't will penalize

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,960
you for having the same content appear

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,279
twice and different sites so is there

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,399
something that Drupal has to to to help

00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:43,029
you out with this like to specify which

00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:46,649
is the main site to to track and to

00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:46,649
ignore site friendly from the other one

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,870
yeah I know we had the case too and I

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,600
think I think it's hard I think we

00:31:52,870 --> 00:32:00,399
didn't solve it because if you have two

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,139
times the same content it is there what

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,399
you can do is you can link to the same

00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:09,730
page but then it it it doesn't work for

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,009
your flow on the website so we had the

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,039
same problem actually but as far as i

00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:21,250
know we couldn't we couldn't solve it

00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:23,080
yeah well you can kind of mitigate a

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:27,539
problem by setting the canonical tag

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,539
properly but it's not a perfect solution

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,870
thank you well my question is sometimes

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,020
I have I have some problems using SEO

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:43,240
with rope up cos some modules call or

00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,030
come trip they generate some messy

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,730
output like views for example when you

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,740
render feuds on the page it generates

00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,960
too many dibs one inside an order I

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,950
would like to know if you have some kind

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,800
of fix you could do without having to

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:04,560
rewrite all the the output of the views

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,560
are the thing you're trying to solve

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:14,410
maybe yourself can help I I'm not sure

00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:16,270
if it's directly an SEO problem but it's

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,730
definitely something that bothers many

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:22,210
people so you can check out their mother

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,330
mothership theme that comes with a lot

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,340
of strip out logic that kind of it tries

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:31,900
ready to get rid of most of the markup

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:34,570
and then well in the end it's Drupal

00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,610
provides us with default templates so in

00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,920
the end we have to override them if we

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,530
want to change them and you can use for

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,840
example mothership to do so or there's

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,790
also when you use pandals there's like

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,560
minimal templates that you can use or

00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,540
display sweet there's lots of tools

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,840
available that help us get rid of the

00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,840
mark-up but by default well it's there

00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:19,710
ok yeah well I guess you're right

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:33,190
Thanks so I have a question on how you

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:36,510
approach your projects with your clients

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:40,629
if you don't have your amazing marketing

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,849
company involved you so this is an

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,740
on-site technical piece of it do you

00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:48,000
also advise them on keywords and

00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:52,060
strategy is that happen and what's that

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,669
yeah exactly this is what we do so if if

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,349
the amazing lives get approached by a

00:34:54,669 --> 00:35:00,819
client and by a potential client we have

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:03,130
one section in the offer about the

00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:05,890
technical development and then we have

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:10,359
another section in the off I nuovo bar

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:11,589
with SEO and so we have vivid we we

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,030
separate them because we are two

00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:14,740
different companies but we tell the

00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,680
client look it's really important and I

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,930
think it's easy to explain them it's so

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,589
obvious that if you build a new website

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,300
you want users to find them so that they

00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:28,390
understand most of the time and then

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:32,020
it's sometimes a bit of problem with the

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,670
Patchett because if you and you bid

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,190
against other competitors and if they

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,500
don't include SEO you are more expensive

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,670
if you include it right away so that's

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,069
why we keep it into two different

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,869
sections and we if you have enough

00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:46,150
budget if we know that we don't really

00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:48,550
compete we put it together because we

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:51,160
really want it to be done if we compete

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:54,630
and there's a hard competition upon

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,630
price we take it out

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:08,790
and for example when we work a drupal

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,910
with two like angular or framework

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:18,080
external to serve the content a which

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:23,070
tool can we use to improve the co that

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:25,670
the JavaScript a markup can't a hot ha

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,670
have not

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,400
well the good news is that apparently

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,730
google is also indexing javascript now

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:45,010
but traditionally you were always I

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:47,950
guess the trap we're not doing it's not

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,840
I I don't think we have done an SEO

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,570
optimization project that involved

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,870
angular for example or any JavaScript

00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,120
heavy application but my my classic

00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,160
approach would be that somewhere in the

00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,200
mark-up I include all the content so I

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,210
can put it in a no script tag for

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,700
example so that the search engine has it

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,210
available um but i'm not an expert

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:15,430
either on the topic maybe someone else

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:18,910
you want to comment hidden link using

00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:21,040
just you hide a link using CSS so the

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,930
user won't see the link and it links to

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,230
a page where the view is rendered

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:28,930
without javascript so when the user

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,150
renders the page he's going to have all

00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:33,310
the angular functionality and when the

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,050
ancient enters the page it's going to

00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,700
see the link and follow that and get the

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,700
content don't need JavaScript

00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:54,580
you can use the google google api to

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,609
record page counts every time you

00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,859
refresh of you and I read that google is

00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,750
also working in order to prove that for

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,300
angular applications because angular is

00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:11,859
you know developed by google so they're

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:19,480
working with that okay one last question

00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:23,530
maybe thanks and have you worked it

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,740
before with rich is lipids on drupal

00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:33,130
integration and if you did it how do you

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:37,180
recommend to deal with that I hand over

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:40,119
to user Rich Snippets if we have

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,540
experience with virtue snippet what kind

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:47,770
of Rich Snippets exactly they mean like

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:49,960
Twitter cards or well we've we have

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:55,990
implemented Twitter cards or Open Graph

00:38:49,960 --> 00:39:01,470
features but microformat I don't have an

00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:05,369
experience okay yeah I think we can

00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:08,589
continue the discussion afterwards so

00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:12,630
thanks for listening and yeah have a

00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,630
