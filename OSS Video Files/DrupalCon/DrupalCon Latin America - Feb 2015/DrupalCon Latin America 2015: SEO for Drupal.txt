	Speakers: dagmita
SEO is tremendously important in the Internet attention competition. Not all websites use their potential to appear amongst the top search results. SEO needs to be considered from the very beginning of the project. There are some architectural principles to follow. Furthermore many optimizations should be done along the way. Last year we have founded our sister company Amazee Metrics which focuses on SEO, SEM, Web Analytics and Online Marketing. We are working together hand in hand to increase our client's reach and conversions. I will give hands on tipps for Drupal as well as practical advice for those who manage stakeholders.
