Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Conversion Rate Optimization
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: joshmiller
Learn about the best-practices for increasing sales by using simple and effective changes to the user experience. We go from simple untargeted optimizations to advanced intelligent optimizations and everything in-between.

Overview

We all have anonymous users that we want to do something. This is fundamental to the internet and nearly all websites. Often, we’re just talking about a visitor trying to find a piece of information and every once in awhile at Commerce Guys we get to participate and lead discussions on best-practices for increasing sales by using simple and effective changes to the customer experience. As we move from the assembled web phase into the experience web phase, we will need to leverage simple and powerful ways to convert those users that end up on our sites.

Talking Points

The presentation is broken up into two halves: Un-targeted optimizations, and intelligent optimizations. Attendees should walk away with valuable insights that could be implemented on almost any site. Some time will be given to specifically talking about Drupal Commerce and checkout workflow. This presentation isn’t Drupal version specific, but any screenshots and module suggestions will be for Drupal 7. For Drupal 8 fans, we will take a look at some new possibilities planned for Commerce 8.x-2.x.

We'll also spend some time talking about industry-standard tools and how they integrate into any Drupal site to help us create intelligent optimizations that are intended to lead specific kinds of users to the desired outcome.

Who will benefit from this talk

Anyone who wants their users to "convert" faster and easier.

really means and then I'm going to jump

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,480
into and this is the practical side

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,269
untargeted optimizations things that you

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
can do to your website to really get

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,780
people to go where you want them to go

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,130
do what you want them to do and then

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,250
we're going to get into the really cool

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,570
and fancy side with tark targeted

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,100
optimizations I want to throw in a few

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,369
case studies with some of the tools that

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,330
exist out there so let's go ahead and

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:32,279
get in there hola me llamo Josh Miller

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,010
so I moon desola rado Drupal and

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,960
commerce guys hello my name is Josh

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,840
Miller I'm a drupal developer at

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,370
Commerce guys that's the only audible

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,270
that you'll hear from me in Spanish but

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,399
I tried I did take some Spanish so

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:51,329
that's me you can follow me on Twitter

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,629
so what is conversion rate optimization

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,520
if we look at wikipedia it basically

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,859
says it's the method of creating an

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,260
experience for a website with the goal

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,500
of increasing the percentage of visitors

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,900
that convert into customers so jargon

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,570
jargon jargon something happens with

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,979
customers jargon it's kind of hard to

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,659
wrap your brain around what's happening

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:18,060
here but there's kind of a better way to

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,610
think about it I think visually so I've

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,549
got a nice visual graph up here and this

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,400
is based on what you can get with google

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,240
analytics for free you can actually see

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,030
the funnel that I'm showing you here and

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,439
what we have typically is a certain

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,450
amount of people going to your website

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,369
and then we have a certain amount of

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,090
people doing something like maybe

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,220
viewing a catalog of products and then

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,939
eventually at some point people buy

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,250
those products and until you get eyes on

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,890
what's actually happening here until you

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,509
get some statistics on where these

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,610
people are going and what's stopping

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,920
them from going to the next step it's

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,320
kind of hard to know where you should

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,979
put your time and effort into increasing

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,540
that last number because ultimately

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,729
whatever that number is and whatever it

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,530
is you guys are trying to do that's the

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,720
number we care about

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,209
so a lot of people spend a lot of money

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,560
marketing their website marketing their

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,569
services trying to increase this number

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,550
in the hopes that that last number

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,980
increases that doesn't always happen

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,490
because imagine if we could increase

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,080
that number without doing any marketing

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:31,530
by making your website just that much

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,690
faster so this kind of graph is

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,870
basically a funnel and it helps us

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,200
visualize conversions and that's so

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,610
important we can stop here we can all

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,380
just be done if you can just get a

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,870
funnel and start looking at what's

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,510
happening to your traffic you're going

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,040
to start finding ways to optimize you

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,930
don't need to hear anything else I have

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,000
to say but we do have some untargeted

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,069
optimizations we can talk through some

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,810
things you can do right now that doesn't

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,360
that don't necessarily cost a lot of

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,970
money maybe a little bit of time that

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,769
can help you start to get to a place

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,600
with your website where you're

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:14,420
optimizing that workflow whatever

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,650
workflow it is you're talking about so

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,350
untargeted optimizations it's another

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,370
jargon kind of word it's just a fancy

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,630
way of saying get out of the way of your

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:32,040
user we have it they're very few of us

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,350
probably hear that own control launched

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,910
one website that no one else has to say

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,950
n and so there's a lot of multi

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,810
communication channels that are going on

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,299
on your homepage for example you want

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,970
some may be the CEO of the company wants

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,980
to talk about this new product they just

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,350
launched and maybe the marketing side

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,000
wants to make sure everyone knows what

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,890
the next event is because they have to

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,980
get those numbers up and by the time

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,780
you're done you've got 16 messages on

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,000
the homepage and no one's paying

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,370
attention you're kind of getting in the

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
way of your user your kind of having

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,840
them walked straight into a shop a

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,480
physical shop and presenting them with

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,790
literally every product all on one flat

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,049
plain you haven't thought through how

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,430
are they going to find that product you

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,630
haven't thought through well if they're

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,169
only going to buy one product what

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,169
should they buy

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,940
so the first optimization first way you

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,980
can get it out of the way of your user

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:34,230
is speeding them up it's very simple you

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,720
just make your website faster slow

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,960
websites reduce conversions that's easy

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,370
to find out you just have to set your

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,010
mother-in-law in front of a computer and

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,450
have her wait for a slow website to load

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,980
she's going to find something else I

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,690
game something else to play with and

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,230
she's going to forget all about what she

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,480
was there to do speed is so important

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,890
Google once determined that users wanted

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,960
30 or more results in their search page

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,330
this was about three years ago I found

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,090
this on a blog post and they implemented

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,090
it randomly they implemented 30 results

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,550
and they and they found that traffic any

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,120
time they had 30 results or more traffic

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,950
dropped by twenty percent too though to

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,490
those pages because it took half a

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,720
second longer to load it's very

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,010
important that speed be first and

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,330
foremost on your mind because if you

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,580
have a slow website nothing else really

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,070
matters I have a case study here real

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,290
quick a wah wah I think is how you

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,300
pronounce it there they had another

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,610
problem it wasn't just speed it was

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,960
keeping their website online if your

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,320
website's not online you're not going to

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,090
be able to have them buy products and we

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,280
recently switched them over to platform

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,890
dsh this case studies on that website

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,080
and they were able to not only save

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,440
money by using platform but they were

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,010
also able to keep their website live an

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,840
interesting statistic they had a

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,020
facebook campaign that triggered a sales

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,730
event that was so successful the

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,510
resulting traffic basically crashed

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,610
their website it just went down and

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,410
that's that's probably a good problem to

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,410
have to have so much traffic that your

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,850
web site goes down but you want to keep

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,820
that in mind that part of the

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,770
optimization is forecasting out ahead

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,710
and making sure you're doing some things

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,450
that scale you don't want it you don't

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,700
want to have a website that works for

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,030
five users but completely fails when you

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,750
get 10 unless you're really optimizing

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,750
for five users

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,860
here's another one this is one that I

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,150
had drilled into my head for four years

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,440
as a graphic design student less is more

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,960
less is always more when you're talking

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,040
about communication you're going to

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,400
remember what that said because it's

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,400
really short

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,040
cool

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:28,170
okay when it comes to your conversion

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,330
goal whatever it is maybe you're trying

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,160
to increase user registrations for a

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,090
newsletter maybe you're trying to sell

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,440
more products if you give your customer

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,960
kind of like I said earlier if you give

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,780
your customer 5,000 products to choose

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,220
from and no way to sort them you're

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,170
going to actually probably have less

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,750
sales than if you gave them three

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:52,230
products and they were all very easy to

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,850
find less is always more particularly

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,530
when it comes to conversion and this is

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,200
something else if you're trying to drive

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:02,240
traffic to a particular part of your

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,240
page as a part of your sales process

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:09,180
it's my opinion as a designer of ten

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,180
plus years and a developer you're going

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,760
to have more success if you put one link

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,340
in a very prominent spot and if you put

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,220
20 links in every prominent spot you can

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,540
think of because it's called clutter and

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,720
I actually I didn't want to just give

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,160
you my opinion I wanted to look this up

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,740
Google Scholar is a great thing this

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,250
particular study that I'm mentioning

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,260
here was done by bunch of professors at

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,320
the University of Calgary in 2001 and

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,729
they set hundreds of people in front of

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,710
traffic sign situations and measured how

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,320
how much error rate what the error rate

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,370
was that they had basically want

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,810
traffic's on their supposed to see

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,090
basically they're looking at visual

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,650
clutter what does it do when we throw 20

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,320
things up versus one thing up on a

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,900
screen and they found not surprisingly

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,230
when you increase the clutter that's the

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:05,460
far right side of the graph their error

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,620
rate triples so this is going to be kind

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,840
of hard to believe but if you give your

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,430
client if you give your audience the

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,500
people who are on your website four

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,680
buttons that all point to the same thing

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,840
it's likely that they're going to click

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,190
on something they didn't mean to and not

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,800
one of the links you gave them because

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,350
you've just put too much on the page if

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,480
you put less on the page you decrease

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,920
the error rate and you increase the

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,930
amount of traffic that's going where

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,850
they want to go and that's really what

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,830
you want you want you want a user you

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,390
want a qualified lead to go to

00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,340
your catalog you want somebody who has

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,680
the money and the desire to buy the

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,870
product to actually go to the add to

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,190
cart page and if there accidentally

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,740
click clicking something because they

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,930
have to choose from 16 buttons you've

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,860
just lost that sale because you had too

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:55,510
many buttons this is another great

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,420
example one I always think of and I

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:02,350
finally found the screenshot to prove it

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,320
1999 huge huge search engine Wars and

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:09,100
there were two competing theories one

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,770
was more is more yahoo and google less

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,720
is more and you go now to google's

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,040
homepage and you'll still see something

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,690
very very similar to this they really

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,360
haven't changed their strategy got a

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,630
couple more links Yahoo's still trying

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,940
to do their thing but ultimately i think

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,510
google actually transformed the culture

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,970
they changed what their customer was

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,160
trying to do which was search because

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,690
this doesn't scale what yahoo is doing

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,400
we can't browse the whole internet like

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,410
this will never will never have enough

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,300
time we just need to be able to tell

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,240
them what we want and then they can give

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,680
us ads and make a lot of money and

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,170
that's their conversion rate so how do

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,430
you get people to have real ads you make

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:54,280
them search so they just boom killed or

00:10:51,430 --> 00:11:00,250
conversion rate by giving the user one

00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:03,070
option less is more here's another one

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,350
reducing step steps often increases

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:09,190
success that just seems like a truism to

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,860
me if I have to walk to less steps I met

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,020
less likely to trip I'm less likely to

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,970
go and bounce off and see a squirrel

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,680
that I just saw there's all kinds of

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,960
reasons why you want to reduce the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,050
amount of steps that are there there's a

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,850
gas station where I live in Greenville

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,700
that they have a loyalty card that's

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,860
lucrative super lucrative you can get

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,070
like 30 doll thirty dollars 30 cents off

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,140
a gallon but to get to that loyalty card

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,810
it's like a 45 minute process if you're

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,870
dedicated it's a multi-day process if

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,690
you sign up you wait for the email you

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,490
click the link you go to their page you

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,139
fill out another form you wait for the

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,220
email I you don't even

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,109
don't even want to count how many steps

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,600
there are the end of the day you have a

00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:56,730
an app that you can just use when you're

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,489
at the gas station and you get 30 cents

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,009
off a gallon imagine if you could just

00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:06,299
pick up a card at the gas pump and you

00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:07,619
would be a qualified conversion person

00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,079
you're actually going to pay money for

00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:13,079
gas and they get your information maybe

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,839
you give them your email to make it

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,579
active they could like triple or more

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,379
the people that are in their loyalty

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,100
program which loyalty programs don't

00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:26,910
make money unless you have a lot of data

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,869
so in lots of ways reducing the steps

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,939
will increase the amount of potential

00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:35,009
for success doesn't guarantee success

00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:37,439
you can have a one-step process that no

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,759
one ever goes through but you want to

00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:43,649
try to reduce the friction so there's a

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,299
couple strategies we can do to kind of

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:49,109
take this abstract thinking and put it

00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,939
back into a web site a site builder

00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:53,100
which is what what track we're on right

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,350
now what a site builder can use speed

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,290
optimization there's this great tool

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,739
called New Relic and if you're a

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:04,350
Pantheon pro or business subscriber I

00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,360
don't remember which one it is you can

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,489
have New Relic for free and it just you

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,339
just literally click a button you click

00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:13,290
Save and it gives you insights this is

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,739
just crazy to me guys you couldn't do

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:19,049
this a year ago I now know that views

00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:20,790
takes up the majority of my page load

00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,939
time on this this is actually a

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,889
particularly troubled website you can

00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:27,980
see the purple peaks there that's when

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,089
you're loading their product catalog

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,369
there's no reason that shouldn't be

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,169
cached if we cashed it you would

00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:36,089
decrease the the site per view would

00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:40,309
increase the site performance by seconds

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:42,480
some of these pages take seconds to load

00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:45,269
this is another one when you drill into

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,799
the views module using New Relic you can

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,899
actually see which views are taking up

00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,839
so much time and at that particular

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,569
product catalog has a little embedded

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,169
view that's called get locations lists

00:13:54,569 --> 00:14:01,319
nearby if we were to just optimize that

00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:02,579
view not all views just that view we

00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,660
would get all of the speed

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,319
optimization I was just talking about

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,540
because that's the culprit mmm going

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,220
back to what I was saying earlier with

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,170
speed optimization you got to have

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,369
statistics you got to know where those

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,369
tools are and you got to use them

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,799
another example less is more this

00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,559
particular example is one that I've not

00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,360
implemented yet but I look forward to an

00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,670
opportunity for a small client to just

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,189
use rules to start doing some really

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,959
cool untargeted optimizations for

00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,449
example let's say you're a newsletter

00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,309
subscriber and you filled out this form

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,619
you've picked the newsletter you want

00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:43,319
you just put your email when you click

00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:47,149
sign up and then unbeknownst to you

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:50,129
Drupal alcor you know with brules rules

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:54,179
reacts to this subscription and gives

00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,589
that user a role toggles it actually

00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:58,589
because you would want to roll that says

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:01,470
I'm unsubscribed and then once you're

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,389
subscribed to a newsletter this block is

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,839
actually just only showing for

00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:08,610
unsubscribed users and that fulfills one

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,139
of our requirements which is less is

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,610
more you want less on your page you just

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,649
straight up want less on your page and

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,759
if somebody has a newsletter don't tell

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,569
them that they have a newsletter they

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,919
know it just get that off the page focus

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,199
their attention on the thing that's most

00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,419
important whether it be a product page

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,339
or something else if they've already

00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,549
connected with you make their experience

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,679
better they'll love you for that there

00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:33,089
are whole companies that base their

00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,199
business on making their experience

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:39,899
better for you here's another simple tip

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,600
and I and I really can't encourage us

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,169
enough push back on your clients that

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,299
want to have 16 fields on a web form

00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:50,970
because again this is a step-by-step

00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,399
process right and if we have this many

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,759
steps in an age where everyone's

00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,610
concerned about their privacy

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,110
particularly this this particular

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,110
newsletter signup form on the left very

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,509
common scares a lot of people and

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,449
probably reduces conversions by a huge

00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,769
factor but if you reduce that to which

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,600
newsletter do you want and if there

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,399
isn't one just if you want our

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,379
newsletter give us your email I don't

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,029
want to know your name

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,099
I don't want to know your phone number I

00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,319
just want your email i'll earn the rest

00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:22,879
in time if you if you're selling

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,649
products you'll get that when they have

00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,389
to give you your billing information you

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,339
don't need that information right away

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:31,189
don't ask for it because that's a step

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:34,599
that you don't need and that's a step

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:36,949
that's not going to help the conversion

00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:38,720
so a quick review these are the

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:40,909
practical steps get out of the way of

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,599
the user remember that slow websites

00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:46,249
reduce conversions less is more really

00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:48,949
if that's all you learn from this talk

00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:54,229
I'm happy reduce steps to increase

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:55,939
success so let's assume now that you

00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,529
have the fastest least cluttered website

00:16:55,939 --> 00:17:00,409
that has optimized check out and

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,269
registration steps but the thing is we

00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:05,139
can do better than that if you're good

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,980
developers if you have a number of

00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:09,139
optimizations you've already done and

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,539
you're still trying to get that extra

00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:14,419
ten percent of your traffic to increase

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:17,779
your buyers there's some stuff we can do

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,149
that's really fancy before we get fancy

00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,980
I want to talk a little bit about the

00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:26,809
information you need to collect and

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,949
understand oh right right right so I'm

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,559
going to go through the discovery

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:32,570
process and then I'm going to share a

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,639
few common strategies that marketing

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,259
automation services use kind of like

00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,669
what we just did and then finally I'm

00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,649
going to list some Drupal specific tools

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,629
that you guys can just turn on and start

00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:45,830
using to get some really fancy stuff

00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:47,710
going so based on greece's keynote we

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,850
definitely want to pursue our customers

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,710
so you don't want to you don't want to

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,960
just get out of the way of your user you

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,419
want to get to know your user so that

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,330
you can pursue them so that you can push

00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:01,549
whatever it is you whatever conversion

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,009
it is you want to them in some way

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,960
whether it be when they land on your

00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:07,250
website there's something you really

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,149
need to tell this particular person

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,019
because they've bought 5 XY widgets and

00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:13,879
you need to make sure they know that's

00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,000
on sale today but only for them because

00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:20,500
they've already bought five of them

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,500
exclusive deals really can drive sales

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:28,350
ok so for discovery discovery all good

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,210
projects start with a discovery phase

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,610
version optimizations just no different

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,500
yet you have to think about what you're

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,150
going to do architect it out and start

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,640
getting feedback right away from your

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,590
clients from and maybe implementing a

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,390
few of the steps but not all of them try

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,820
to get some feedback before you go and

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,860
move more of your your effort into that

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,120
so there's three areas we're going to

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,929
look at audience goal and bottlenecks

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,980
know your audience it's important

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,659
particularly in automated marketing

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,520
which is what targeted optimizations are

00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:04,530
automated marketing basically is what

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,460
Amazon does right it's you go into

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,320
amazon and they show you 25 products

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,380
based on your wish list your past

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,750
purchase history everything you could

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,010
possibly want maybe some lego sets that

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,690
you've always wanted never told them

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,890
about but yet they still show up and

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,710
they're just taunting you because you

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,900
want the legos and you can't you can't

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,240
convince your wife to buy them that's

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,010
knowing your audience that's not on a

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,690
creepy level because we kind of expect

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,730
amazon to know our preferences again

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,400
this is going back to what reset in his

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,730
keynote you need to start prioritizing

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,740
leads based on what you know about your

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:46,340
users so for example if you're a company

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,990
that is selling a particular product

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,280
let's say a particular service it's

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,650
important for you to know the difference

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,690
between a decision maker and a

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,730
researcher somebody who finds the

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,590
information and gives it somebody to

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,270
make a decision and somebody who is

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,610
actually just showing up and wants to

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,070
know the bare minimum and whether or not

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,750
they should say yes or no those are two

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,400
very different users one of them is

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,840
going to give you money and one of them

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,880
is going to take a lot of your time and

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,309
they're different users so you want to

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,140
give them different experiences and if

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,179
you don't know that about your users

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,530
that's what a discovery is going to help

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,870
you to you're going to start talking

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,130
about the kinds of people that pull the

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,159
trigger on money and the kinds of people

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,710
that help those trigger pullers actually

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,880
learn about what you're trying to offer

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:34,770
so know your audience know your goal

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,530
seems simple enough what is your bottom

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,020
line what is the thing you're trying to

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,029
do if you don't know what your bottom

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,219
line if you have 15 goal

00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:47,249
this goes back to less is more you have

00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,899
15 goals you're not going to have one

00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,739
goal that you can optimize for and

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,080
you're not going to have a very

00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:54,419
successful very successful automated

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,989
marketing campaign because you're going

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,340
to have crossed paths that cancel each

00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:01,559
other out you're going to try to send

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,419
them to a newsletter and get them to buy

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,059
something and get them to get on your

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,639
webinar choose one easy button and hit

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,259
it as hard as you can and once you've

00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:15,029
got that going then choose another one

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:16,679
so know your goal thirdly and this is

00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:18,149
something that all automated marketing

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,899
tools are going to try to get you to

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,519
define is no your bottlenecks where and

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,960
this this goes back to that graph I

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,409
showed you at the very beginning where

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,950
we've got 200 we've got 50 and then

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:35,039
we've got five buyers what what takes

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,929
you from 200 250 people on your catalog

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,940
is it because it's hard to find a link

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,379
to your catalog is it because it takes

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,389
so long for your home page to load

00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:45,089
people hit it but they bounce before

00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:46,109
it's loaded those are your bottlenecks

00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:52,409
those are the things you want to look

00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:55,859
into we'll see if it pops back or if it

00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:59,700
goes away an anecdote in the 1990s

00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:01,649
amazon offered add to cart one-click

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,989
buying in the 90s they offered one click

00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:06,119
buying email confirmations post shipping

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,549
follow-up but they still had one huge

00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,649
problem this was before they got really

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,889
big and it was when they were fulfilling

00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:15,839
their orders order fulfillment is really

00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:17,239
really hard fact at Commerce guys right

00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,979
now we're working with a client whose

00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:21,989
sole purpose for their new website is to

00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:23,809
make order fulfillment easier and it's

00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:26,009
it's taking quite a bit of effort to

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,830
narrow it down what what is order

00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:30,539
fulfillment why does it matter so much

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:34,999
amazon figured out that they could

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:38,129
actually own the whole order fulfillment

00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:40,349
pipeline and make it awesome for their

00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:43,440
users but a significant amount of their

00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:45,479
profit for the next ten years was put

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,339
into order fulfillment you wouldn't

00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,809
think amazon was in the business of

00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,070
shipping things but then again you kind

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,720
of think about it and yeah they are

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,249
they're really in the business of

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,010
selling things but to sell things they

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:58,260
have to get them to you so they optimize

00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,790
that bottleneck which by the way had

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,870
nothing to do with their website had

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,260
everything to do with customer

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,550
experience and that's one of the steps

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,100
they took to becoming the biggest

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:11,820
retailer online so you got it you got to

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,100
keep in mind it's not just about the

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,510
discovery isn't just about figuring out

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,040
what can I do on my website it's about

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,560
learning about your business and trying

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,250
to to reduce the friction at every turn

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,170
and I threw this in here at that the

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,390
heart of conversion rate optimization

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,120
this isn't necessarily a task for you to

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,970
do but this is what user optimization or

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,620
automated marketing does they know

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,260
you're anonymous users as best they can

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,790
if you guys weren't aware of that lots

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,110
of people online are tracking you and

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,310
that's why you have to opt into cookies

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,850
that's why you have to opt into all

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,740
kinds of things and if you know who your

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,220
announcement anonymous user is then you

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,170
can start optimizing your content and

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,980
what exactly what kind of experience

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:58,260
you're giving them so common strategies

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,390
what do now we know our users and we can

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,520
say hi to them let's talk about what we

00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,630
can do with that the kinds of things you

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,220
can actually accomplish with this

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:13,080
personalized experiences targeted

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:17,910
content a good example of that is I'm a

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:20,670
particular kind of Lego fanatic okay so

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,910
i go to to lego calm and i want to know

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,740
what their biggest most expensive sets

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,910
are and i want to put them on my wish

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,740
list and i'll never be able to afford

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,320
them because i like to spend months

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,580
building this monstrosity and know that

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,250
it's going to take forever to get

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,950
through someone else might really just

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,730
care what what is next in the set that

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,740
they've been buying for their

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,540
five-year-old for the last you know six

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,090
months and they just want to learn about

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:49,080
the five year old set if we're going to

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,220
target based on certain users you're

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,210
going to need to know them you're going

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,290
to need to do everything i was just

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,350
talking about and you're going to help

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,990
them understand the kind of content you

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,910
have without getting in their way so

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,350
what you see is automated marketing is

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,660
taking all these strategies that we

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,030
talked about before and really pushing

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,490
them hard for particular users this is

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,840
an example on the automator website they

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,549
have three different users

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,169
they're all getting emails but one of

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,820
them is interested in triangles one of

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,210
them is interested in squares and one of

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,669
them I think a very creative individual

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,010
with a red shirt really likes circles

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,690
and so they're sending out emails based

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:29,400
on their preferences not necessarily

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,020
your preferences as a marketer this this

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,630
is an example of the Amazon page this

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,770
morning at 6am for me they know that

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,299
it's Valentine's Day and I haven't

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,809
gotten anything yet or they just assume

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,330
that i just bought new shoes that look

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:45,840
remarkably similar to those shoes I

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,850
didn't buy them on Amazon I'm not really

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,340
sure how they know that I might have

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,720
looked at him on amazon I don't know

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,940
additional items I have a lot of dewalt

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,970
tools that are on my wish list this is

00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,200
kind of cool as a consumer and kind of

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:03,270
creepy as like privacy issues so be

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,940
careful when you walk that line another

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,409
common strategy is lowering the barrier

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,510
and filling in the picture this is

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,090
something I learned from then Finkley I

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,860
didn't even know the strategy existed

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:18,570
then Finkley is the owner/operator of

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:21,860
Valachi who owns automator I was

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:24,210
surprised and a little confused and

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,000
basically the strategy is this you ask

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,669
for a little as little information as

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,520
possible but always ask for a new piece

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,529
of information so this is going to be

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,480
important and hard to do without

00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:38,100
something helping you know well what

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,010
information don't I have from this user

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,590
what's the next thing to ask and I got a

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,659
little illustration here back to the

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,179
newsletter that you're having people

00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,649
sign up for someone fills in their email

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,899
that's all you're asking for right

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,309
remember we're reducing friction but

00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:55,740
then you want to kind of add a little

00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,970
friction the next time they come maybe

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,980
you're going to give them the ability to

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,929
unsubscribe and choose another

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,010
newsletter but instead of asking for

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,539
their email because we already know who

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,390
they are we're just going to ask for

00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,549
their name and then we're going to take

00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,929
it one step further now that we know

00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:11,700
their name this is when it gets really

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,500
fun because people actually respond to

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,320
this and this is straight out of one of

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,730
his one of Ben's presentations hey Josh

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,429
do you want to be notified when Product

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,870
X goes on sale yes I do I want to know

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,520
when the next biggest Lego set is

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,260
available

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,120
I want to know if it's got more than

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,740
15,000 pieces so I can just get excited

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,210
about it so I want a discount alert and

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,670
you know what you know my name my email

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:38,230
maybe to Lego it's important to know how

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:40,250
big my company is or two to company X

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,170
whatever piece of information they

00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,330
consider is most important for them to

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,480
fill out their user graph so they know

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,400
how to push to you another example maybe

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,990
it's not newsletters maybe now that

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,430
they've subscribe to your newsletter or

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,650
perhaps they've just logged into your

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,800
site to act some access some free

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,660
service we know who this user is and yet

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,380
we're still going to do something that

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,330
might annoy them a little bit but in the

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,860
end it helps us sell to them which is

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,570
we're going to ask for one piece of

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,860
information instead of just giving them

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,510
a download link we're going to ask for

00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,460
their phone number they get the white

00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,480
paper just for a phone number we already

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,090
know who you are we're just going to

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,740
keep filling that information in until

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,540
we've got a full complete picture of who

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,000
this person is once you have that

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,140
complete picture you can then qualify

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,690
these leads you can look at their

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,520
traffic history and say okay this person

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,720
is really interested in X and you can

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,220
take that lead because you have their

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,590
name their phone number and their email

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,480
hand it to a salesperson they can close

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,160
the deal because you've been paying

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,110
attention and you've been trying to

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,550
track their information in a very very

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:46,310
frictionless environment automated email

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:48,680
marketing I don't really like emails but

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,890
I always open up my Apple emails that I

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,810
get because I like the pictures because

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,610
they talk about things that are

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,370
interesting and innovative and maybe I

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,590
just i'm a sucker i don't know but i

00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,300
like some some of my emails I really

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,180
like and I think it's because I do

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,220
something like this where they track

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,380
what I'm doing with that email and they

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,810
don't just show a report to a marketing

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,700
advisor they actually take an action one

00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,000
way or the other what you based on what

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,590
you do if I engage with an email at some

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
point they should send me another one

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,040
saying hey thanks for reading that email

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,540
would you be interested in this free

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,310
webinar that tells you a little bit more

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,110
about that where you can learn a little

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,730
bit more about that user maybe they

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:32,300
click this link and you're asking for

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:35,210
their I don't know their middle name

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,290
something that you didn't know before if

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,420
they don't interact at all

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,610
then you now know that this is a lead

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,800
that's maybe less qualified but also

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,450
somebody who you might be able to tap

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,100
again with an email just because maybe

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:51,590
they missed it another common strategy

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,270
these services uses lead scoring this is

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,730
what I've been talking about you you

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,080
started to fill in that social graph the

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,620
information that you need to know about

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,110
an individual once you've got names and

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,120
numbers you need to know who if I call

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,460
next if I can call one person right now

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,500
in my list of leads people that might

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,020
want to buy from me or might want to

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,150
sign up for something who's going to

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,790
most likely say yes and a lot of these

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:22,340
services this is a screenshot from aqua

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:23,900
a lift automator does this too they're

00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,090
going to try to tell you what's the next

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,890
best step who's your most qualified

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,350
leads and you can even automate it

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,770
further and probably can convert it into

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,600
a Salesforce lead that then your

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:41,600
salespeople your sales staff can then

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:43,900
take and try to close the deal so here's

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,670
a few of the tools that are available

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,050
I've mentioned both of them throughout

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,910
the presentation I've tried to anyway

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:56,600
automator if you go to Automator it's

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:59,350
about that way calm you can see videos

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,480
the tricky thing with these things is

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,540
they're selling tools that funnel people

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,740
to the final result they want so just be

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,330
prepared that you're going to get

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,190
funneled really quickly because they

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,040
know what they're doing so if you're at

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,600
all interested in this just you know

00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,370
recognize that Valachi is probably going

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,480
to be calling you at some point because

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,760
you've signed up for one of their white

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,130
papers or Acquia lift sales people are

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,800
going to take you out to lunch one day

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,650
so anyway that these two particular

00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,780
products integrate fully with Drupal

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,600
they're both in some respects turnkey I

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,340
believe Automator pushes a discovery

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,260
phase before they turn it on so you get

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,300
the most out of the product and I

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,760
believe aqua just says turn it on it'll

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,210
work it's up to you to decide which

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,560
which strategy fits your needs we have

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,840
two different case studies and then I'll

00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,270
open it up for questions this is

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,250
Automator I asked

00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,200
and to give me something that I could

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,000
tell you guys you know about the success

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,450
of the platform and he said they've

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,920
recently helped a baseline of Health

00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,920
Foundation that's what this little

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,710
pop-up thing is for there are targeting

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,610
anonymous users and they really really

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,920
really needed newsletter subscribers to

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,480
to eventually you know go through and

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,890
get their final goal I don't think it

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,700
was just their final goal was newsletter

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,800
subscribers this particular campaign

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,050
that automator helped them run based on

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,580
images and who was actually looking at

00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,860
it and the kind of traffic that they'd

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,900
had on their site and all the lead

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,910
generation that they did they increase

00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,150
their registrations by over eight

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,530
hundred percent and this is working with

00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,840
a service that costs a little bit of

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,160
money but if if what you want to do is

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,500
throw a little bit of money at your

00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,510
registration problem and have a company

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,580
come in and help you with that solution

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,840
first of all you shouldn't do that until

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,030
you've optimized everything I just

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,790
talked about in the first section of the

00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,290
talk but after you've done that these

00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,940
are the kinds of things the results you

00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,850
can expect when you work with an

00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,070
automated marketing company this is a

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,130
from a case study that our quail if

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,830
tweeted to me they have this is really

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,150
cool guys I love multivariate testing I

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,460
feel like I'm a Google employee when I

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,010
read about it and do it and I just this

00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,650
stuff is awesome so we have the control

00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,600
option this was a link on one of their

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,220
sliders if you go to Aqua calm they have

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,020
about 50,000 sliders on their homepage

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,960
there was one link on one of those

00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,090
sliders that they wanted to try to get

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,100
more people to click and so what they

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,350
did was they left it alone that was

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,390
their control and then they changed the

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,910
text just barely and if you read the

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,350
whole case study on their website you'll

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,230
you'll you'll read about what they

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,150
changed option a was just a couple words

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:44,440
an option B was just a couple words and

00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:45,880
after about a month's worth of showing

00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,440
it you can see it's like twenty four

00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,690
thousand twenty one thousand and eleven

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,160
thousand they can extrapolate which one

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,750
of these options is going to give them

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,210
the most traffic then they can just

00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,040
leave it there or they can keep option a

00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,370
and come up with three more ideas and

00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,810
they can keep optimizing for taking the

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,680
two hundred users that are already

00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,540
arriving at their

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,940
I and making it two hundred users that

00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:10,260
end up on their product catalog and 200

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,640
subscribers that end up taking the bait

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:18,340
so that's what hawk we lift can do and I

00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:21,100
think that's really cool so this is a

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,510
the wrap up something I mentioned in the

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,380
talk where I was going to talk a little

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,420
bit about what Drupal commerce 8x can do

00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,670
for optimizing check out and that kind

00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,200
of thing first of all I want to shout

00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,760
out right after this after the coffee

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,680
break Ryan's going to talk in depth

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
about Commerce 8x there's lots of cool

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,350
stuff going on there but we take this to

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,850
heart at Commerce guys we really want to

00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:48,400
offer a platform that you can build

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:51,670
great frictionless user experiences and

00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,430
when we went to the drawing board to

00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:57,160
come up with 2x we talked about check

00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:59,380
out and one page check out and filling

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,340
out customer profiles and how do we

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:05,130
optimize that and one of the cool drupal

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:08,170
features that's out there now an 8x is

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:10,300
four modes you know what display modes

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,190
are right you can create a teaser of an

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,350
article and you can create a full page

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:18,270
and you can create custom ones if you

00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:21,130
went to now I'm trying I'm blinking

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,650
Krell's talked yesterday not this

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,540
morning yesterday where he talked about

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,610
design and display modes these are

00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:31,750
display modes for forms so you can

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,680
create eventually in commerce 2x you're

00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,210
going to be able to create different

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,150
check out flows based on your targeted

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,880
users so maybe you have one user that's

00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,440
only buying a digital service you're

00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,940
going to be able to completely optimized

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,130
that to take their credit card so that

00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,260
you can every month charge them for that

00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,730
service and you're going to be able to

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,700
change the pains and everything else

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:54,970
that you would normally do with a form

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,160
and if they're buying a mixed bag maybe

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,440
services and products you can have a

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,450
different check out and maybe and so on

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,460
and so forth so we're going to be able

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,460
to start really differentiating check

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,960
out forms another one this is really

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,910
cool because it goes back to the primary

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,050
very first thing that if you did it once

00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,340
and that's it that will increase your

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,490
conversions which is make your website

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,690
faster right now to get your to get your

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,970
add to cart button to work

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,619
it has to load every single product from

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,540
the database that's connected to that

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,980
node which isn't a big deal if you're

00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,960
selling a shirt with three colors and

00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,530
three sizes it's a big deal if your

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,859
shell if you're selling an event that

00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:35,770
has 16 different locations 16 different

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:37,750
languages in 16 different time slots

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,300
we're talking about maybe a hundred

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,829
thousand products loading in on every

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,220
page load we don't have to do that

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:46,390
anymore with 8 X 2 X is we've got a

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,650
different strategy different

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,740
architecture that will help us optimize

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,290
for that and finally we're going to have

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,720
a lot more control over the way things

00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:58,060
look down to the product level all the

00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,160
way up to the catalog level because of

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:07,859
because of innovations on Drupal core

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:10,300
with twig so gracias and preguntas or

00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:13,890
any answers that maybe I have with

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,890
questions that kind of thing anyone

00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:24,000
talked a lot about lots of things show

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,000
of hands who okay yeah

00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:37,810
but this the 11 click is that is that

00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:44,860
patent or is that under some kind of a

00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:50,800
protection by amazon okay what what

00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:54,010
exactly about Amazon ah the way they're

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,380
dealing was shipping the one click

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,880
purchase yes one click purchase back in

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,040
the 90s I think they did file for a

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,040
patent right when they did that but I

00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,390
believe this was a year ago when I read

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,100
the blog post there was a company that

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,470
had filed for something similar a year

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,170
before that and personally I hate

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,690
patents that stifle innovation and

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,630
stifle Commerce and I really think one

00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,840
click pay now right now kind of actions

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,119
would be awesome for our economy but yes

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,530
amazon did patent that and I guess they

00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,840
saw that as something that would be hard

00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:33,160
to innovate on any other questions yeah

00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:36,160
I don't know if this is going to be a

00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,900
very open question about it in your

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,450
experience out good number for

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:45,040
conversion rates will be like I don't

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:47,260
know three percent four percent yeah

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,869
it's not the problem is and this is my

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:53,920
this is my wife's favorite phrase it

00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:56,350
depends it really depends on the user's

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,790
you're working with I would never expect

00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,340
to see a hundred percent conversion rate

00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,440
never you're going to find random people

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,850
that show up on your website from Serbia

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,030
and I don't know why they're there but

00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:09,010
they're they're not the Serbians aren't

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:13,359
awesome I know a couple great Drupal

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:15,060
developers from Serbia the conversion

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,150
rates were looking for really

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:22,060
percentage-wise don't matter the trick

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,680
is making them go higher and that the

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,510
other in the bigger trick is knowing

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,810
what they are to begin with getting

00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:31,750
solid data that you can continue to push

00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,970
and try to try to say well okay I know

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,190
right now i'm getting a half a percent

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:39,280
of the people that i'm sending the email

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,350
to right now opening it how can i make

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,300
it bigger maybe it's a flash your

00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,079
headline in the subject line maybe it's

00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,809
sending it

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,170
or in the case of real milk cheese com

00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:52,269
sending it more mr. Beale miss calm in

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,450
the back that didn't send me any emails

00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:57,549
this year you're going to increase your

00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,469
conversion rate and that's that's the

00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:01,809
real thing is there is there a water

00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:03,849
line that says yes you're doing really

00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,849
well if this particular percentage is

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:10,390
high I have no idea because we see them

00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:12,670
all over the board and the trick is and

00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,009
it always is the trick is to try to get

00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,109
the customers and sometimes the

00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:19,269
developers to take the time to get the

00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:22,959
numbers because you can have a feeling

00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:25,349
but until you validate it who knows any

00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:29,739
other questions another one all right

00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:31,180
more about patent it's sorry about that

00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:34,769
question a great presentation I really

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:37,690
really enjoyed it the Drupal 8 for

00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:41,049
commerce up what's the timeline for that

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:43,749
coming out in terms of post acquia being

00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:45,069
an alpha and migrating of modules and

00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:48,999
like when do you guys anticipate being

00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:52,509
reproduction ready coming straight from

00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:56,249
me I don't know it depends my favorite

00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:56,249
phrase Ryan might have a better answer

00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:02,349
you know I'll provide an update in the

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,599
next session on like what's been done

00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:07,239
what needs to be done from a sales

00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,769
guidance standpoint I tell our team not

00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,199
to plan on any Drupal a project is

00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:13,359
selling until like you know the second

00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,130
half of the year ideally you know the

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,489
fourth quarter if they can wait that

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,499
long and that would be to begin the work

00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:23,170
but to finish that I still wouldn't plan

00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:25,479
on launching it until next year and it's

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:30,989
you know not so much the Commerce pieces

00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:32,979
it is just everything and this is a

00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:35,739
conversation I was having last night

00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:38,859
with seed one of the sponsors they just

00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,690
launched their website on Drupal 8 which

00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:42,849
is awesome and so exciting and I want to

00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,920
like log in and see their whole website

00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:47,170
running on it but they don't have beta 2

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,209
beta migrations yet so the next beta

00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:54,369
they're going to have to like hope it

00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:56,890
just works so I definitely wouldn't try

00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:57,800
to start building something on Drupal

00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,570
beta that's going to

00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,450
lunch even if you launch it right now

00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:04,940
it'll work because it's running with a

00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,740
few bugs until you have some sort of

00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,990
migration path that'll get you on to the

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:13,460
release candidates and eventually the

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:17,450
stable any other questions we got we got

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,250
two guys you talk about like technical

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,250
approach but what about communication

00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,740
and these i don't know like persuasion

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,050
emotion trust in these conversions right

00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:32,300
increasing like all about story telling

00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:35,990
one story how you can talk about that so

00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,540
there's a kind of a competing theory

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:42,980
right now for how do you get conversions

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:45,110
and I grew up making websites in middle

00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,850
school in high school that had pages

00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,400
that you clicked on and linked to and

00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:51,260
you split up your website and something

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,490
that kind of randomly happened about two

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,060
years ago as we started seeing these

00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:58,520
really long sell one page websites that

00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,400
at the end if you made it down and you

00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,590
scrolled that far gave you some sort of

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,470
way to take the next step either buy

00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,390
something or to register we've seen a

00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,130
lot of success with those one-page

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,630
landing page kind of things that

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,450
actually take a while to get through

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,040
because what that does is it reduces the

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,410
friction because you're not clicking on

00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,570
things you're just scrolling and in the

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,160
typical users mind scrolling is a lot

00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,680
less effort than clicking which actually

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,840
I don't think is true like purely on

00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,480
like I'm going to spend energy scrolling

00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,650
takes a lot of effort but scrolling is

00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,210
just seems to be a little bit easier

00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,340
there's less commitment i'm not going to

00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:36,650
lose my place where i am so you're

00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,300
reducing friction and then by the time

00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,570
they get to the bottom you've qualified

00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,720
that lead because they've just spent

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:46,280
whatever it is an hour 30 minutes to get

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,690
through that content and they're still

00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,910
there they're at the bottom of the page

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,730
they're ready whatever the next step is

00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,590
they're ready to sign up there ready to

00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:58,700
increase now your question was more

00:43:54,590 --> 00:44:00,830
along the side of how do you articulate

00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,730
your message and how does that impact

00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:06,620
the conversion rates it depends I hate

00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,840
saying that it really does if we're

00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,740
talking to Drupal developers just the

00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,870
facts ma'am if we're talking to

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:18,950
if we're talking to people who really

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:21,530
like to knit maybe there's some evidence

00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:24,230
to show that they really enjoy a story

00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,980
behind where their yarn came from and

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:30,260
that increases the sale of that yarn so

00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,150
it kind of comes full circle back to

00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:35,000
your discovery process and knowing your

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,130
users and knowing your goal and saying

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,750
and being prepared to do things like

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,180
instead of just saying this is the yarn

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,930
i have saying this is the story behind

00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:47,330
the yarn that we have because our users

00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,030
love stories and they can really invest

00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:52,160
in them and they really because I mean

00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,660
I'm seeing that a lot more on social

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,910
media people are sharing the stories

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,710
behind their products and they seem to

00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,510
really connect with that I don't have

00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,280
any hard data to put to put that but

00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,870
Google Scholar is really good so maybe

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,100
just like Google a couple things and

00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:11,120
find some professors that have done the

00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:13,070
hard work any other questions no okay I

00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,530
believe coffee is next I'll stay up here

00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,030
for a few minutes thank you very much I

00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,270
would really appreciate if you could go

00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,610
online I know I never do this myself but

00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,820
I will be hypocritical if you could go

00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:27,830
online find my session and give me some

00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,880
sort of feedback I don't see your name

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,470
but it helps me be a better presenter so

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,810
anything you could give me and I can't

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,450
really you know I can't take credit for

00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:42,430
the court not working so any anything

00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,430
