Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Drupal in the Post-PHP-Renaissance World
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: EclipseGc
As the PHP renaissance continues to change how developers work with PHP, Drupal has made significant strides toward adopting PHP’s new best practices in both code and interoperability. New groups focussed on the interoperability of disparate PHP projects have begun to get traction producing such standards as PSR-0 and PSR-4 while others work to model a reusable request/response layer. The interoperability awareness of PHP projects and frameworks has never been higher, and projects working to adopt and contribute to that interoperable future have an opportunity to contribute to the future standards of PHP in an unprecedented way.

Drupal carries with it a significant existing install base, and componentization could lead to use in non-Drupal installs. Formally componentizing Drupal’s existing code base further and making individual components available to the non-Drupal world will spread our influence far and wide. In this talk I’ll elaborate on:

Building PHP Components
Componentizing Drupal
The future of modules
Component Interoperability
Stack PHP & PHP FIG
Expanding Drupal’s reach into the 82% of the web that is run by PHP
