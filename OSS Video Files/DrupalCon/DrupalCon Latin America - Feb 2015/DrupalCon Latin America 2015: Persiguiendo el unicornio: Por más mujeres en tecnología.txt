Persiguiendo el unicornio: Por más mujeres en tecnología

Aunque Drupal sea una de las comunidades Open Source con mayor representación femenina (17%) aún nos queda mucho trabajo por delante. La escasez de mujeres se ve en la asistencia a los eventos, en los equipos de trabajo, en los ponentes...

Compartiremos el trabajo que estamos haciendo en Women In Technology Perú, inspirando a más mujeres a mostrarse como líderes en nuestra industria. Buscamos integrar a más mujeres en las comunidades de tecnología. Contaremos un poco sobre qué es lo que nos ha dado resultado y qué es lo que no, así como los puntos que tenemos en cuenta para seguir la labor.

Nuestro objetivo es que los asistentes salgan con un entendimiento de:

Por qué la escasez de mujeres es detrimento para la comunidad
Por qué es importante "alzar la voz" y no quedarnos calladas
Por qué es importante que los hombres se involucren en el problema
Qué puede hacer uno para ayudar a cambiarlo

Chasing the Unicorn: For more women in technology

Although Drupal is one of the Open Source communities with greater representation of women (17%) we still have much work ahead. The scarcity of women is seen in attendance at events, working on computers, in the speakers...

We will share the work we are doing in Women In Technology Peru, inspiring more women to appear as leaders in our industry. We seek to integrate more women into technology communities. We'll share a little about what it is that have given us positive result and what not, and the points that we need to consider on the future.

Our goal is that attendees leave with an understanding of:

Why the lack of women is detrimental to the community
Why is it important to "speak out" and not remain silent
Why is it important for men to be involved in the problem
What can you do to help change it

Who can understand English? Can you raise your hands?

00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:09,500
Okay. Who can understand Spanish?

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Because we'll have both. [Spanish]

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,930
I'm going to talk in English and then Freddy's going to give his testimonial in Spanish.

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,589
[Spanish] This is a bilingual talk.

00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,970
[Spanish] My name is Karen.

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:43,730
I am from Women in Technology Peru. I work at Promet Source, and this is the unicorn talk.

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,440
I know that it's important for women to get

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,390
into technology. This is a talk I wanted to get out there to

00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,520
encourage more women to do something in our industry.

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,310
Basically, where does the name come from? It comes from my first days at Promet Source.

00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:13,030
I was talking to one of my colleagues, a female developer, and we were talking, "Yes, I do

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:20,030
project management, but I also code and I do Drupal and I also do Ruby and things like

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:27,920
that," and she was like, "Oh my god, you are a unicorn. You are not supposed to exist."

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,920
That's where the unicorn name comes from. I was challenged to have a unicorn hat for

00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:45,179
this talk, but I couldn't get it, so sorry. That's my Twitter handle and my Drupal.org

00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:50,460
name if you want to contact me. That's my email as well.

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,259
Like it says, I work at Promet Source, which is a very diverse company.

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,399
There are so many women there from all ages. It's great.

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,399
My story begins where I bet most of your stories begin if you're female, where you go to college

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,480
or university and you look around in your classes and you find out, "Oh, there are not

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,760
so many women here." This is not something you think about when

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
you choose your career. It's not like you think, "Oh, I'm going to

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,880
go into a male-dominated field because I'm weird like that."

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,190
No, you just choose because you like it. It's your passion, and day one in the classes

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,190
you find out that there are only like six women in the room from 30 people.

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,340
You decide you're a warrior. You can take it.

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,530
It starts getting worse as you go up in the semesters.

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,180
Finally, when you get out and get a job, sometimes you are the only woman on the team, or when

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:06,880
you get to the tech events, you are one of the only 10 women in the 300 people attending the event.

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,440
This is my story.

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,440
This is why I got into this cause, you could say.

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,290
This is my cause. I wanted to make for more women to get into

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,290
these events, to feel safe, to feel encouraged, so they could participate and be more visible.

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,040
This is why we decided to form a community. We started as a community.

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,570
We are now going ahead of that. We started as a community, and we did the

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:48,570
first women-branded event in Peru. I know this is a thing in the United States

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:56,010
and Europe, but this is not so known in Latin America, and two years ago this was the first

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,000
we did in Peru. We didn't think it was going to be that much

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,940
accepted because the first comment you get from the guys is: "Is it only for women? Why

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,160
can I not participate? Why is it pink?" Things like that.

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,959
We got around 70 people in attendance, and it was really good.

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,959
The main commentary on this event was: "I didn't know we were so many."

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:34,430
It's good to talk to other women and to talk about, discuss the confrontations we have

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,080
at work, how to solve the problems we each have.

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,550
It was a good first experiment, and we decided that we needed to do more of that.

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,550
That's how Women in Technology Peru was born, and I'm going to give a summary of events

00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:00,370
we've done so you can get an idea. This is the first Women in Drupal event we

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,370
did in 2014. It was really funny because we decided to

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,599
do it on Saturday, and then one week later we found out that DrupalCon was on that same

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:20,599
Saturday, so we decided to join both events. The guys from the Peru community were all

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,259
passing through the classroom because they wanted to meet girls.

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,860
It was funny. They also helped us do the installation because

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,229
Peru computers are different, so they helped us a lot.

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:42,229
That was the first one. On the right, you have the Women in Drupal

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,729
event we did in Bolivia. I'm going to talk more about that later.

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,639
We also have other technologies. We don't only do Drupal, which I'll talk more about.

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,819
The first question that comes to mind is:

00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,759
"Why?" Why is it important to bring more women into

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,349
our industry? We know we are low in the numbers because

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:13,680
we see them. You walk around and you can walk across many

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
guys but not so many women. Why is this important?

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,199
I don't know if you're familiar with "brogrammer" culture.

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,419
It is the macho programmer culture. [Spanish]

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:47,430
I'm going to show you a little bit of that culture just so you can get your rage going on.

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,740
I don't know if you know this site.

00:06:54,749 --> 00:07:01,749
This is a site that promises to teach you web development by watching videos of women

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,460
that get their clothes off. I'm going to show you a small video just so

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,240
that you can get the idea. -Hey, this is Cammie Lee from Codebabes.com.

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:29,540
Want to learn to code or your having trouble paying attention? Welcome to your solution. All the other sites offer the same shit. We take gamification to the next level, offering real positive feedback like Pavlov's dog on crack.

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,600
You want a badge? What? Do you work at Chotchkie's? Do you need more flair or something?

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,480
We've developed a revolutionary learning program that leverages sexual desire and turns it

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,140
into the most powerful learning mechanism ever known to mankind.

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,910
Babes and code. You watch the lesson, absorb the info, pass

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,300
the quiz, and the instructor removes one piece of clothing.

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
How much clothing, do you ask? Enough to motivate you, but let's not get

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,000
carried away here. We are an education site.

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
So join a couple of ridiculously hot codebabes and start your web development career today

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:12,509
or just watch for the entertainment value. -I know.

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,129
What's the first thing that comes to mind? This is a joke, right?

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:22,729
This is not supposed to be real, right? I guess the guys who created this startup

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,479
thought of it as a joke first and then they decided, "Why not? It's a valid business model,

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:34,479
right? We should go ahead and do it." It's an actual business if you go and Google it.

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,500
The thing is, why is this acceptable in our industry?

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,820
Why is this not something that gets shut down, basically?

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,180
What can we do to make it different?

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,310
This is what the whole movement of getting more women into technology is about because

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:06,310
it has become so mainstream that it's not only in the tech industry, it's getting known

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,870
across all the different areas in media. This is a cover that was, I think, last week

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,940
or a couple weeks ago on Newsweek. It basically repeats itself.

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,540
There is a change that needs to go on, right? Something needs to change.

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,540
It's not something that only happens in the adult professional business, but it gets shown

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:45,930
across also educational, instructional... Children, for example.

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:53,070
This is an example of a Barbie book, which teaches that girls can also be a computer

00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,730
engineer by telling them that if they want to program, they need to involve their male

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,079
programmer friends because Barbie is not good enough to code on her own.

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:14,079
Things like this slip through the cracks. Sometimes we don't see them, but this is something

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:21,560
really important because girls who read this story are not at an age that can judge whether

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,329
they're good or not. This basically propagates these same stereotypes

00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:33,329
that we have currently in the industry. Talking more about serious business, why it

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,870
needs to be changed, is the rise of the "sheconomy," which means that women are getting more and

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:51,350
more power to purchase or acquire products in the economy.

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:58,740
What happens if more than 50% of the growing power that decides which products to buy isn't

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:07,089
involved in the process of building them? You have an issue where you're building products

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:25,180
to cater or to market to a particular industry or sector and it doesn't sometimes have the same vision.

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,759
It's not aligned.

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,800
That's one of the things. Also it's because it's important to have diversity.

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I was talking with Nick about this yesterday, and he would mention this example of DrupalPicchu

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,120
they went to and heard about the constellations, how the Inca saw the constellations in history.

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:58,399
It was like usual, traditional cultures see the stars and they form pictures with the

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,250
stars, and that's constellations. For the Inca culture, it was the opposite.

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,089
They didn't see the stars. They saw the black spots or the dark clouds.

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:15,190
They actually saw images in the dark areas of the sky.

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,190
It was opposite than the traditional. It is important to have these different approaches

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:38,720
or different visions of the world. I did this quick review of speakers in the DrupalCon.

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:47,900
We have six sessions by women from 36 sessions, I got.

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,900
Around 17% of speakers are female or sessions

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,800
led by females. It means that this should be around 50% or

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,810
at least 30%, right? This needs to grow more.

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,810
I encourage the women in the room who haven't given a talk probably in the future to try

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,250
to do that as well. I'm going to show you a video of why this

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:22,470
is economically important not only in philosophy.

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,060
-I think this is actually really a Rosie the

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,200
Riveter moment and that is that women are the great untapped bench.

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,760
If you just look at the numbers, and they're super simple, let's say that women are 60%

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,920
of undergraduates and they're 20% of computer science majors.

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,400
Imagine a hypothetical computer science department with 100 students each year.

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,140
At 20%, women are 20 of those. Men are 80 of those.

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,860
If you simply took women to their appropriate proportion of undergraduates, which is 60%,

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:19,980
for every 40 men, there would be 60 women. For those 80 men, there would be 120 women.

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,780
That would be 200 students out of 100. If women were just represented proportionally,

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,140
we would double the number of software engineers this nation is making every year, and that

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,940
would be timely because the number of jobs is tripling.

00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:46,970
-It's a great opportunity right now. If the number of jobs in the tech industry

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,860
is tripling and we don't have enough workforce, it means that there is an opportunity for

00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,519
us to grow quicker and accelerate our professional growth rate if we get more women into this

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,050
field as well. We need to encourage outreach not only to

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,100
women who are already in the industry, but to schools and high school girls who are about

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,100
to choose a career so they can also think of the technical field as an option for them.

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,980
What we've done with Peru is basically we focus on four pillars for camps we do.

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,089
We do tech training. We do teach them how to code, HTML, Drupal,

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:41,089
and other technical fields, but we also focus on networking and entrepreneurship because

00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:46,889
sometimes we need that human side as well for us to connect and collaborate.

00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:53,889
We also do outreach, teaching kids how to code so they can embrace a new culture, basically.

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,370
This is the party that started it all. We went to Cajamarca, which is in the mountains

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,310
of Peru, teaching for a whole weekend girls how to do their web pages.

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,839
Mind you, this is an area where the internet is not good, so we had to do a lot of offline

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,839
processes, so there are the girls doing their mockups or their wireframes for their sites.

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:28,490
We've also done startup weekend events where they are encouraged to found their own tech

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:35,689
company, which is also important because there are not many female tech founders, so we need

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,019
more of them. We've also done Rails Girls.

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:47,420
We've done the Women Tech Makers, which was the first big event we did.

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,420
We had over 300 people attending. We also participate in international panels,

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:02,499
like in Grasshopper. The program that we are doing right now.

00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:08,339
It's the first one that we are doing. It's eight weeks, we are teaching high school

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,020
girls how to do web development. It's an eight-week program with three times

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:21,020
a week classes where we teach them not only HTML and CSS, but to go through the whole

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,400
arrangement of how to program, how to do Arduino and get their first line of code out there.

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,870
Those are the girls getting excited because they got "Hello World" on the screen for the first time.

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,460
We are also doing activities with kids, teaching

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:47,309
them how to code from scratch, how to play games that help them see a picture from a

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:54,309
logical perspective. Also, we do Women in Drupal, which are events

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,679
trying to get more women into our community, basically.

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,439
This is the first Women in Drupal panel we had in DrupalPicchu.

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:11,450
This was a great opportunity to get the word out there that the Drupal community was encouraging

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,840
women and welcoming them into our sector. On the right, this is the event we did in

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,970
Bolivia where we took a workshop inviting women to learn about Drupal and get their

00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:36,529
first website up and running. What's important in this is that the women

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,190
that come to our events are not only technical women.

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,779
Sometimes they come from the marketing side or the journalism side.

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:53,059
It's important for them to be as welcomed and as easy to teach this workshop so they

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:59,679
can get their own website going on without having to do a lot of coding experience for

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:08,239
the first time. These workshops are aimed at getting the basics done,

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,299
the site building, and putting the theme out there so they can get at least started

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:21,299
with a basic configuration for their site. The main point for this is don't stay silent.

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:31,580
Do something. If you think we are in a bad situation or

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:38,580
we can improve a lot, do something about it. If you wait for someone else to do something,

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,990
nothing will get done. That's what we learned.

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,990
We were talking about doing events for women for two or three years previously before we

00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,120
decided to do something. My encouragement for you is to do something

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:07,039
and also to raise your voice because sometimes when we are in a team that's full of other

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,039
developers that have a more competitive attitude, it is easy to stay silent and not share your ideas,

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:24,390
not share your thoughts. This has happened to me and other women that

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,850
I've talked to where they have the typical horror story.

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:36,850
They were in a meeting with managers and their team and they were discussing how to implement

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,480
a solution, and they gave an idea. They were just starting.

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,480
They shyly gave their own idea of how they could fix the problem, but she wasn't heard.

00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:01,210
Everyone ignored her because she's just starting, and 15 minutes later another guy says the

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,750
same thing, and that's the solution that gets decided on to try and implement.

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:14,750
It's important for us to be more confident. When we propose solutions, when we share ideas,

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,730
when we share thoughts, we need to be confident in what we do.

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:25,630
Even if we don't really feel it inside, there is a saying that says "fake it 'til you make it."

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,559
You need to do that exactly.

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:37,580
Sometimes I joke that it feels like we are battling with dragons because the guys can

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:44,580
be so demanding and they have their own culture and different bonding than us, but it's important

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:54,770
to be a strong person as well. If you don't feel it, try to fake it and feel

00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:02,470
secure and confident out there. There is a name for this, and it's called

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:09,539
imposter syndrome. It happens to most of us.

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,919
For example, I'm an introvert. Even if it doesn't look like it, I'm an introvert.

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,919
I have trouble with this. I battle with this every day.

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:30,190
You have no idea how much it took for me to stand up here and talk to you and present

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,789
and share. This is how I convinced myself to go out and

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,860
do these things, because I tell other girls to do it, so I cannot be shy and I cannot

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,860
stay silent and I cannot do nothing because if I teach other girls to do it, I should

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:55,750
do it as well. It happens not only in the tech industry,

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,770
but it also happens in other areas. I don't know if you know Lupita Nyong'o.

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,200
She won an Oscar. It happened to her as well.

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,980
-She is making her feature film debut in "12 Years a Slave" as the slave Patsy.

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:26,140
"500 pounds of cotton day in, day out, more than any man here, and for that I will be clean."

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,700
-Feature film as an actor.

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,160
-What kind of nerves did you have. Were you anxious at all about being able to

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,731
pull this off? -Oh, yes.

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:41,180
From the minute Steve called me until the minute I got on set, I was certain every day

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,060
that he was going to call me and tell me he'd made a mistake.

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,320
I suffered from acute imposter syndrome. How on earth did I pull one over him to give

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,780
me this role? The doubt was always there.

00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:04,240
I remember in my first rehearsal with Michael Fassbender, we finished going through the

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,340
scene, and he turned to me and said, "You are my peer."

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,020
That made a world of difference. It was exactly what I needed to hear.

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:20,470
-It is important for us to get the support of other people telling us that the ideas

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,830
we have are important and we need to share them with the world.

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,480
That is why I have my co-presenter with me, which is Freddy.

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,010
He is an amazing guy. He was the guy who brought me into Drupal.

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:42,010
He brought me into the meetups. He is also the guy who helps us in Women in

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Technology Peru, encouraging us and preparing the curricula and everything we need to do.

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,850
I'm going to ask him to share his testimonial of what he thinks from a male's perspective

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,960
of why this is important. This is going to be in Spanish, so I'm sorry.

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,750
-Hi.

00:25:11,750 --> 00:35:01,710
[Spanish]

00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,480
-Thanks, Freddy. Yes, he jumped up the rabbit hole.

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,740
What can you do? If this is important to have, what can you

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:26,700
do and how can you improve our own community? The first thing is to start small, to start

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
even at all, and to join powers with other people.

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,660
It's important to have a team. It's important not to do it alone.

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,900
It's important to talk to other people who have already been down that road to get information,tips,

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:50,000
recommendations on how to do it. This is Veronica I'm with.

00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:57,000
She decided to do a Women in Drupal event, and she wanted some kind of guidance because

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,200
she was so afraid of public speaking. She was not sure of being able to do it alone.

00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:11,500
I said to her, "I promise to you that I will be there, so whatever the date that DrupalCamp

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,100
in Bolivia is going to be, just share it with me in advance, and I will travel to Bolivia

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,640
with you and we'll do the workshop together. You'll see it's not that difficult.

00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,940
It's going to be fine, and you're going to enjoy it and you're going to be able to teach

00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,720
more of this and share more of these workshops." So we did.

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,880
The night before, we were still working on the slides because you're always working on

00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:44,840
the slides until five minutes before the presentation, and she was scared to death.

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,480
I was telling her, "You know, Veronica. Let's forget about the workshop tomorrow.

00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:58,120
Let's go and eat, have dinner, talk about it, laugh about it.

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,440
There's no point in worrying about it right now because there are going to be issues.

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,700
There are always going to be issues. You are not going to be able to resolve everything right now.

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,080
You cannot imagine all the scenarios that are going to appear.

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,820
You will just deal with them as they come.

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:23,020
Just put on your armor and grab your sword, and we'll fight it together once we get there."

00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:31,400
The main question that once comes when we start doing these events is: Do we do it only

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,700
for girls or do we accept boys to come? This is, like I said, the old dilemma because

00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,060
you want more girls to come, but you have limited space and if you open it for everyone

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,020
sometimes the boys can take more space, and you want to encourage women to come.

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,660
It's like a circle. We have to approach this, right?

00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:01,180
The first one is we do it for everyone, but we put a lot of pink in it.

00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,540
The registration, the landing page, everything is pink and girly, and boys just get scared of that.

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,380
It's like pink will kill them, so they decide

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,140
not to participate or decide if they really, really want to go there.

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:26,380
That's one of the approaches we have. The other one, the one we started with, is,

00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:34,180
"Okay, a boy can come to the event, but please invite a friend, and that friend needs

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,920
to be one girl friend so she can learn with you as well."

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:47,740
That was especially helpful when we just started because word didn't get out as quickly that

00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:55,420
we were doing these kind of events, so, as always, our friends who are mostly male get

00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,300
information much faster and they also want to participate.

00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,160
This encouraged them to bring their friends, their girlfriends, their sisters, cousins, whatever.

00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,680
Another thing is, like Freddy said, the guys

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:20,000
in the community are always willing to help you, so if you think that this is going to

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,280
be a greater task and you are not going to be able to do it alone, please ask for help.

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:34,380
We are not supposed to stop doing something just because we think we are alone.

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:44,320
These are the guys in the Bolivia community helping us set up the computers for the servers.

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,040
This is the guys helping us in the Python camp.

00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,820
This is the guys teaching us in the Ruby community. Every community in technology is willing to help you,

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,960
especially true in the Drupal community. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help.

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:11,440
Even if you just want to ask for teachers because you may not feel like you're ready to teach.

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,340
You can also ask for someone else's help and you can help them facilitate everything.

00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,860
That's a good way to start. The important thing is to start.

00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,800
What is happening right now? You need to raise awareness of Drupal because

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,780
most people know about WordPress and other platforms out there, but not everyone knows

00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,680
about Drupal, especially true with the female gender.

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,520
Try to reach out to them and teach them about that.

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:57,020
Make sure to market your events or your workshops to that particular sector that may not be

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:04,200
from the technology industry. Overcome the fear.

00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,700
Not everyone is out there to troll you. They are considerate people, so if you make

00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,760
a mistake, like if you are doing a demo and the server crashes or there is no internet,

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,580
people will understand that, so it doesn't have to be perfect.

00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,280
You just have to do it.

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:30,500
Money always helps, right?

00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:41,000
There are ways to get funding, especially if you are just starting alone or with a small group.

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,720
The first option is crowdfunding.

00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,820
The community is always willing to put their own money in there.

00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:56,260
I don't know how to say this in English, but at least in Peru we say [Spanish] so you can

00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:06,320
get enough money in there to at least cover coffee breaks or the Meetup group subscription.

00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,180
Things like that. It was really great to have the support of

00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,380
the community the first time. Also reach out to companies because there

00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:27,420
are companies that also care about diversity, so you can reach out to companies, and you

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:35,000
can reach out to universities for the education. There are also grants.

00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,540
The Drupal Association has grants for encouraging these kind of events.

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,780
If you feel like you need to have more money to support you in your event, please ask for

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:59,240
a grant and try to do something at least. What we are used to saying in the Women in

00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,900
Technology group is that we are so used to bootstrapping, I cannot tell you how much

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,100
money I want or what I want. You tell me what you want to give me,

00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:15,100
and I will tell you what I can make with it. It is not the best way, but we've been used to that.

00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,880
It's always important to start with what you have, if if it's just $10.

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,540
Maybe that coffee break is not that necessary to have in your event.

00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,300
Join the Women in Drupal group, where women

00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,400
all around the world share their stories. They have communications about things that

00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,000
are going on in the community. If you have a local group that's dedicated

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:49,800
to raising awareness to this issue, also join and participate.

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,620
If you say that you don't want to organize events, there are also options that are not

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:04,240
necessary for you to start a group. You can always mentor someone.

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,200
There are always people who need help or encouragement. You can always mentor your friends and try

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:17,400
to get them to achieve a higher standard of what they think.

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,180
You can also volunteer for many of the events or many of the organizations from groups that

00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,000
are already doing something. That's also important.

00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:38,300
I cannot tell you how much work there is in organizing an event or organizing groups.

00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:47,740
There is so much going on all the time that even if someone volunteers just to move stuff from one room to the next one, that's a big relief.

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:58,500
Everyone is welcome to help. If you don't want to spend your time, you can also spend your money.

00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:03,580
Look for your local groups, people that are trying to do this, and if you cannot spend

00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:09,180
time you could also donate. This is part of the crowdfunding that I was talking about. That's it.

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:19,280
This is a picture of me and Freddy. No, he's actually Freddy.

00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:29,740
I don't know if you have any questions or preguntas or comments, feedback, anything.
