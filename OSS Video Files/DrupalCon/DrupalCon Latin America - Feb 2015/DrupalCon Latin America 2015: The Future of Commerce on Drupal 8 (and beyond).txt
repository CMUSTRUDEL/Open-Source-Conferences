Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: The Future of Commerce on Drupal 8 (and beyond)
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: rszrama
Drupal Commerce was developed from the ground up on Drupal 7, both benefiting from and contributing to the development of the Entity API, Views, and Rules modules. It redefined what Drupal can do in the eCommerce space, empowering businesses to sell physical products, event registrations, reservations, and digital products. Its ecosystem of contributed modules supports recurring billing with all of its complexities in addition to complex tax, multilingual, multi-currency, and omnichannel configurations.

Moving forward to Drupal 8, we're reevaluating our feature set and architecture to make Commerce easier to use and to develop for. Starting with sprints at DrupalCon Austin and in Paris during the Summer of 2014, we began developing a generic set of libraries solving price and address management to share with the rest of the PHP community. These libraries are then used by our Drupal 8 modules along with a fresh implementation of the various entity types and subsystems that make up the Drupal Commerce framework.

In this session, you will learn about:

The generic PHP libraries we are developing for handling prices, taxes, discounts, and addresses and our efforts to see them adopted by other PHP based eCommerce projects
The key features of Drupal 8 we’re taking advantage of
How changes to our architecture and user interfaces address the most common frustrations developers and merchants have with
Drupal Commerce 1.x frustrations, and how we’ve addressed them
What Commerce 2.x is capable of today and how our roadmap compares to the Drupal 8 release schedule
Let’s talk architecture, look at a demo, get excited, and start bidding on our first eCommerce projects powered by Drupal 8.
