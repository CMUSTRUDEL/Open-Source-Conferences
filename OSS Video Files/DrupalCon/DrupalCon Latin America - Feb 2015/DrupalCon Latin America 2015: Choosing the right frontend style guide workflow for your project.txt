Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Choosing the right frontend style guide workflow for your project
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Aaron Stanush
Frontend style guides (or pattern libraries) have exploded onto to the scene of web development. You can now publicly view the inner workings CSS and documentation of popular websites and web apps such as Starbucks, Github, Yelp, Disqus, and the BBC.

How were these guides built? Who uses them? And most importantly, how did they choose which approach to take?

In this session we’ll first take a look at the landscape of methods, including pattern libraries, Atomic Design, and Style Guide Driven Development (SDD).

Finding your workflow

Then, we’ll talk about how you can adapt these approaches to fit your (or your team’s) desired workflow. There are two broad workflows we’ll look at, discussing the pros and cons of each, as well as what tools are out there to use:

Outside Drupal

This approach involves creating the initial style guide and prototypes before even starting on the Drupal environment. This allows the team to get ahead of the UX and design work while using basic HTML/CSS to rapidly iterate ideas. These artifacts serve as the blueprints and foundation for the site and can be leveraged throughout the project.

Inside Drupal

This method uses the Drupal development environment itself as a way to prototype and style pages. The style guide can also be automatically generated from the development code. This requires an advanced knowledge of the “design in the browser” philosophy, but can save time and effort in the long run.

you through a tour of the factory you

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,010
know they really kind of opened up you

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,350
know how they were building this whole

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,420
thing and it was really complete it had

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,900

of online property just using the style

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,820
guide that they put out there and though

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,220
they didn't have the open the source

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,890
code available to you you know it was

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,470
easy enough to dig through it so that's

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,660
really awesome so you know if you kind

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,060
of look back to this NASA style guide

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,650
that they put out there you know it was

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,180
dead on arrival you know we had no way

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,280
of knowing you know that's a dead style

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,650
guide what you really want is a living

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,390
style guide something that's online

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,940
anybody can access any time and it's

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,049
easy to up you know update and keep you

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,090
know current so you might be asking you

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,100
know why why create this so let's just

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,130
go into a couple specifics you know that

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,770
does old pedia old

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,450
guides their PDFs no way to tell what

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,850
the latest version is hard to distribute

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,370
hard to keep up to date impossible to

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,290
document you know you're using PDF to

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,640
document you know web guidelines and

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,620
that's kind of dumb you know and it's

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,520
impossible to do web interactivity so

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,020
you know let's just throw all that out

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,090
you know what you want for a living

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,970
style guide is you know it's going to

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,730
immediately / food provide team-wide you

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,740
know vacation everyone in the

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,260
organization will be able to you know

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,310
contribute to it they'll be able to read

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,790
it teams will be able to work together

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,710
better you're going to have design

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,080
consistency this is a screenshot taken

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,390
from a bank website and these are all

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,980
the different buttons on the website and

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,860
you can see how it's just a giant mess

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,030
and it looks horrible so you know one

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,290
thing that you have a style guide is you

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,510
have designers and developers working

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,030
from the same kind of documentation you

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,710
know you can aim for reusability you can

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,340
not just you know create a new button

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,140
every time you need one additionally you

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,160
know speaking back to reusability you

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,050
know if you've got if you're creating

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,480
these patterns and components for all

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,190
the different pieces of your website

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,660
plus the aim of usability that's going

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,800
to lead to faster build times for your

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,480
team right so that's a good of damage so

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,830
besides the things I already mentioned

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,580
you know there's some more technical

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,230
advantages avoiding CSS bloat you know

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,910
it's made with actual HTML and CSS

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,910
unlike those pdfs you know you're

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,650
actually building in the medium that you

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,050
know you're providing your documentation

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,820
for you know they're one of the same you

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,970
make it available online easy to find

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,930
make it easy to edit and then you know

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,130
big advantage is you have version

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,420
control so if you throw that thing up

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,180
and github whether its private or public

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,220
you know you're going to have you know

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,330
you keep track of the revisions you're

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,650
not going to lose anything and you'll

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,650
always know what the current version is

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,840
so what's in a style guide there's all

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,860
kinds of flavors out there one of the

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,690
common ones you'll see out there is

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,490
branding so you know we saw that in the

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,350
NASA saw guide yeah they provided logos

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,120
but could you download them know the

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,650
website they sent you two didn't exist

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
so here you know if you have the saw

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,760
guide you're not only documenting how to

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,100
use the logos how not to use logos but

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,449
then you have links to the PDFs or sorry

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,919
the PNG's and the

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,539
you know illustrator files and vector

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,930
files that you can actually go forward

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,520
and use them you can do what MailChimp

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,559
did and they provided a writing guide

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,849
writing style guide for their team so

00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,979
they have a very specific kind of like

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,210
tone and voice for their brand if you're

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,830
a customer you'll kind of see they have

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,210
a lot of humor and their emails and

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,069
things like that so they throw that up

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,339
online for all their writing team to

00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,659
reference so that all their kind of you

00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,020
know voice and tone across all their

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:09,729
materials is consistent additionally

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,129
you'll see people like Google put out

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,860
things like design language so with the

00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:17,249
material design that's slowly rolling

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,360
out to your different Android devices

00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:22,240
you know they included some specifics

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,710
about how to design Android app but they

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,879
created this thing called material

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,729
design which is really more of like the

00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,620
philosophy of how you know why what is

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,270
what's what is behind material design

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,129
was the design thinking behind it and

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,509
the philosophy of you know what were

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,270
their trying to do here in this big you

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:40,960
know redesign so that's kind of a big

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,129
broad kind of ambitious thing you can

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,899
get more specific so if you have a

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,060
really large team of developers you want

00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,099
them all kind of you know using the same

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,199
amount of you know having all their you

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,939
know text editor set up the correct way

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,360
and they're you know writing you know

00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:56,889
PHP and you know SAS syntax and kind of

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,659
in a standard way so you doesn't have to

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,520
you know change it so you might put up

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,110
you know you might would do what github

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,959
did here and they have JavaScript

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,819
guidelines for developing for github CSS

00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,039
guidelines they put all that up all

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:14,259
align up online available for anyone to

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,279
see this is probably the bulk of we're

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,449
going to talk about today so I mentioned

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,159
it a little bit earlier today about you

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,800
know this has a million names component

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,099
library pattern library UI library

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,659
front-end style guide this is kind of

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,159
breaking down your peace your website

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,490
into its basic components in the

00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,529
building blocks showing the design on

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,669
the page and providing code samples so

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,589
that everyone is you know design

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,729
designers developers project managers

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,409
business owners they're all kind of on

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,539
the same page that all speaking the same

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,779
language about these things they're not

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,459
rewriting the SAS or the HTML like it's

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,939
all laid out here you know for the

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:50,500
different components so really it's kind

00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:51,730
of a choose-your-own-adventure for how

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,199
you want to build your own style guide

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,290
you could do just one of these things

00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,329
you could do all of the

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,160
it's really kind of up to you about you

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,160
know where you want to start which

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,120
people on your team you want to talk to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,120
you know who you want to get to get

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,470
involved I would advise probably

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,750
starting with the basics you know things

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,079
like your branding assets your logo the

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,630
color the typography your grid kind of

00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,829
how pages are laid out and then you know

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,380
thinking about those building blocks of

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:21,170
your site you know whether they're

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:25,940
carousels or you know pagers or bread

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,079
comes or whatever I like this quote by

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,399
Susan Roberts and she wrote a really

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,500
great article unlisted part about

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,509
creating saga it she said it so you know

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,130
your style guide is a one-stop place for

00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,620
the entire team from product owners and

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,720
producers to designers and developers to

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,730
reference when discussing site changes

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,319
interracial iterations so again it's

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,050
just a common vocabulary for the entire

00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:46,160
team to use in any kind of discussions

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,540
whether you're you know talking about

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,440
building a new you know whether the

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,880
business owners are talking about

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,139
building a new section the site or the

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,850
designers and developers are getting

00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,589
into kind of a you know in-depth

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,569
discussion about you know how to build

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:01,190
something so this is kind of the meat of

00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:03,319
the talk talking about a couple of

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,519
different approaches so I have these

00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,529
three different names out here that I

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,060
may be using to the presentation all

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,040
except the middle one are kind of made

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,930
up by me as far as I can tell there's

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,069
not really a standard way to talk about

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,810
style guides because there's so many

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,069
different approaches but from my

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,329
research these are kind of the three

00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,040
different categories that I've kind of

00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,930
grouped them into and these are just

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,440
kind of the arbitrary labels I gave to

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,839
them but hopefully that makes sense

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,310
start with the manual style guide so you

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,680
know whatever your process is to do your

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,209
design exploration and kind of working

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,620
through your page layouts and you know

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,620
the reporter typing things like that you

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,060
know do that however you do it then you

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,699
want to get that into a style guide

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,189
you're starting to formalize it in this

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:44,870
manual system you can kind of do a

00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,339
custom bill to something like Jekyll or

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,480
there's a couple of different style

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,709
guide frameworks out there that will

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,329
kind of help you get started with

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,779
throwing in you know basic elements like

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:56,569
you know h1s h2s paragraphs let you know

00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,930
typography stuff things like that then

00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,250
you would you know kind of using that

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,170
style guide as a reference you know you

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,519
jump into the design and build process

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,079
kind of you know they're kind of your

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,880
blueprints for the site so you're going

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,700
into your design and build process

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,060
eventually you make it to production so

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,680
we use this on a site that we just

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,260
recently launched called roll pulse com

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,540
I think it was in development for well

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,560
over a year and we it kind of had a long

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:27,950
design timeline so we created this style

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,480
guide in Jekyll and it's up there the

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,650
address there and that'll send you to

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,080
the github if you want to dig around on

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,030
the guts of it yeah so this is kind of a

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,920
way for us to like you know build out

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,800
the style guide you know take it

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,120
step-by-step colors typography Anthony

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,680
OH as we had more patterns you know

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,510
starting to throw those in there and the

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,920
guide as they're available and then our

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,840
developers can kind of use this as

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,030
blueprints to then you know build out

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,980
the site we've also saw this with Code

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,360
for America so they recently put up

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,560
their stuff or you know I think a year

00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,390
ago they put their style guide so

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,850
everyone could check it out I think was

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,450
built by a company called clear left

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,460
interesting with them they didn't

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,040
actually do the implementation they were

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,080
hired just to do the design work so they

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
built this really awesome pattern

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,590
library and that was the deliverable so

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,330
you know they did all the research and

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,670
discovery and all that did the design

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,750
work and then as a deliverable for you

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,830
know whatever team is going to go and

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,290
implement it they had this really

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,890
awesome pattern library to reference so

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,120
as I mentioned there's a couple

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,150
different tools so kind of the two

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,030
different ways you know of the kind of

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,100
manual saga as I've seen a lot if

00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,230
they're going with a kind of static site

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,470
approach I've seen them using things

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,430
like Jekyll and middlemen and again as I

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,020
mentioned there's a lot of different

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,460
tools that they're kind of help we get

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,380
started with your you know pattern

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,120
library or UI toolkit and those are

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,850
length there I think they're probably

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,350
the biggest drawback with this approach

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,610
as opposed to some of the other ones is

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,900
how to keep it in sync because you kind

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:03,350
of have two disparate systems so I'd say

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,900
number one is just keep the stylist you

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,810
know the SAS and other assets keep that

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,340
directory totally like the same as your

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,500
production environment so you know I've

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,650
seen people actually just like you know

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,880
just copy and paste it and override it

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,190
the very least you know you know if you

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
add something new to the style guide you

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,190
know you're breaking it down in kind of

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,830
a component

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,020
based you know SAS directory you know

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,950
with you know partial SAS partials for

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,420
every different component you know

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,800
that's a little bit that's pretty easy

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,360
to maintain because then you can just

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,570
you know grab that one and then throw it

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,860
into the production site it was just I'm

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,480
not a developer but I was discussing

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,100
with some of our developers at four

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,930
kitchens and they throw out terms like

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,560
get subtree merging I don't know what

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,090
that means but maybe you do similarly

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,760
they mentioned it things like Bauer

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,960
which I'm a little bit familiar with and

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,330
there's actually a tool called style

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,810
prototype actually built by Sam Richard

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,850
famous dribbler and he has a section to

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,820
read me there about how you can use bow

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,680
you know you can create make your

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,990
production site have the style guide as

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
a dependency and Bauer so that you don't

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,110
have to do any of this manual sinking

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,750
junk like you know it's all handled

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,310
through code so you can check that out a

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,140
little bit later we'll be talking about

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,520
an advanced technique where you can

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,980
actually turn your style guide into a

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,810
service that your websites and apps can

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,340
kind of you know you know they literally

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,750
use that so there's no duplication

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:29,440
they're actually just using that as a

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:31,210
tool so when to use this approach this

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,850
is not prescriptive but here's some kind

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,230
of ideas that I have you know maybe

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,420
doing design up front is not part of

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,050
your process or at least not you know

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:44,140
long design up front process maybe your

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,670
organization you know due to time

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,780
constraints or whatever or team

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,480
constraints you need to kind of just

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,160
dive into building the thing without

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,430
spending a lot of time you know building

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,120
the design in a separate system

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,200
additionally you know maybe you don't

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,490
have development resources that are

00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,870
available at that time and you guys have

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,810
designers that you want to crank away in

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,100
the design and then at that code for

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,530
america example i mentioned you know

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,780
maybe design is a little bowl so you

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,040
know you don't need to mess the pressure

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,680
environment because you can just build a

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,180
tool that lets you build the component

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,130
library in the best way that you know

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,510
makes sense for your team second

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,740
approach is generated style guide so

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,780
again kind of you know just using

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,190
whatever technique that you use to go

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,339
through your visual design prototype

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,620
process then you would go directly into

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,220
the design and build so this is kind of

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,750
a designer and browser type approach the

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,660
difference here is that

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,980
with your code that you're developing

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,470
against generators leverage actually

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,810
putting your documentation into the like

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,120
SAS itself so I'll do a show you example

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,760
that a little bit in a little bit but

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,870
that's the big change there so you know

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,840
directly from your design build you go

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,330
to production and then you run a

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,250
generator and by magic boom it outputs

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,650
your style guide so it's taking your

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,910
actual production CSS code and turning

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,050
into the style guide you don't you're

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,610
not really maintaining two systems

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,030
something else is magically generating

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,830
that sound good so you might be asking

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,970
what is a generator so let's do an

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,210
example with one of the most popular

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,770
tools out there called KSS there was

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,620
recently a port by John Albin who

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,690
created to laporte it's a node and you

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,250
know it's called KSS node but basically

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,410
here the steps you would write your sass

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,800
like you normally do add your

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,730
documentation as comments in the SAS on

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,110
the command line you're going to run

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,450
your generator app whichever one you're

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:38,350
using and then boom it out put the style

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:43,300
guide so let's check it out so this is

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,500
what the SAS kind of looks like you know

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,730
the big difference here is this big

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,810
block of stuff that you normally don't

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,370
have up that you might have you know

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,190
buttons and that's it right but not on

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:56,620
this other junk so the big difference

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:59,740
here is so in case s buys example you

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,170
would put your title at the top then

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,640
your description so you know buttons or

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,319
if it's a carousel you talk about what

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,050
kind of carousel it is or whatever kind

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,010
of component you're using the last one

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,540
is kind of important because this is

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,250
where it gets your saga edge structure

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,900
so just like a book your style guys

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,160
going to have chapters and subchapters

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,020
so here's where you kind of define that

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,510
stuff so I'm saying it's style guide

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:25,300
chapter 11 point 0 this next section is

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:27,510
getting into kind of the subchapter so

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,370
now we're going to start talking about

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,010
these specific set of buttons so we have

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:35,170
our section tile section title default

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,480
buttons you know we might have another

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:41,140
section for some other kind of buttons

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,510
later a markup so this is actually the

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,330
markup that it's going to use to spit

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,190
out the mark-up in your style guide so

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,980
you can see it says button class and

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,380
it's got this node uh you know token

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,560
here for modifiers and then it closes

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,940
the button element below that you're

00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,650
going to set your classes in state so

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,680
for an example I have a button alternate

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,940
class I'm a button bold class and you

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,240
know I want to see what happens when i

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,350
hover it and then lastly the important

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,840
thing about you know i'm making this

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,070
style guide 1.2 so you know if I have

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,200
another section it would be cell guide

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,480
one point sorry this is 1.1 if I don't

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,740
want to be 1.2 and then just below that

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,790
you know it's just saw your regular

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,340
stuff you just style like you normally

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:25,540
would so once you have your sass you

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,970
just you know of course you have to

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,490
install this tool but once you have it

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,330
installed you just run KSS node what

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,040
that's going to do is it's going to

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,750
parse your style sheets it's going to

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,120
look for all that syntax that you've

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,040
written there above your sass then it's

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,930
going to output static HTML files in

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,860
your style and a style guide directory

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,230
and of course you know you can change

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,570
that and there's all kinds of modifiers

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,140
to this you know command line or this

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,490
command that you can really modify a lot

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,070
of different things about yourself i but

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,630
this is the basic example so what that's

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,420
going to do is output something like

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,910
this so by just installing que sus node

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,700
adding that syntax that you saw running

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:06,190
it i have a page like this and it's

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,720
going to you know you can see that you

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,820
know I did write markup for each one of

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,220
these I just use that token to say you

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,110
know use this class this class and the

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,700
hover and you know this is all

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,800
interactive so I can kind of see how it

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,210
changes on the page you can see how it's

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,630
already started to build my table of

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,840
contents on the left hand side so this

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,730
is really cool I have all I've done is

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,230
add my occupation documentation to my

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:34,420
production site and not get a style

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,860
guide so you're probably wondering how

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,600
does this work with Drupal I won't

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,340
explain it because John album is are

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,590
doing a fantastic job of explaining it

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,300
ajab economy and amsterdam i got the

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,950
link there i'll be sharing my slides

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,840
afterwards so you can get all the good

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,460
links but a really great presentation

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,780
how it shows you how to use KSS notes

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:54,640
specifically against a drupal

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,560
environment so i just i mentioned KSS

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,050
note KSS node is one example there's

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,690
lots of generators there's a whole

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,179
website dedicated to them again there's

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,220
another

00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,840
list apart article that goes through

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,429
these and kind of goes to the pros and

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,619
cons and kind of splits them out by you

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,720
know whether you like to work with PHP

00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:13,700
or ruby or node you know it's got

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,210
generators of every different flavor and

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,879
usually Forks of each one too so you

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,480
might ask when is when do you want to

00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:24,830
use this approach maybe your project

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,399
doesn't afford a lot of time for upfront

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,509
design maybe you want to design against

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,740
the production environment so maybe

00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,299
you'd like to just jump directly into

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,879
Drupal and start kind of prototyping and

00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,259
designing in Drupal then you could have

00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,299
you know saw guide directly from a

00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:39,649
Drupal environment maybe you're only

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,909
doing the implementation so maybe we

00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:43,940
weren't given a style guide you're

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,289
giving some other kind of or maybe you

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,610
weren't given a nice like interactive

00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,440
online saw a guy maybe we're getting

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,869
some other kind of loser style guide you

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,789
could take that poor that documentation

00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:54,619
against your you know sass and then you

00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:55,789
can solve this out guide at the end and

00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,409
then maybe you know I think the most

00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,779
popular was you know you don't want to

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,669
maintain a separate custom system for

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,809
your other saw guide and then uh you

00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,980
know another advantage is this just

00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,179
keeps it in sync and you don't ever have

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,119
to worry about it because it's coming

00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:12,110
directly from the production code lastly

00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,759
for lack of a better name calling this a

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,470
hybrid approach so assume you've already

00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,340
made it kind of two you know development

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,679
production stage you're going to take

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,850
that actual CSS and JavaScript and

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,840
whether you know assets that it's

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:29,720
included in that site create some kind

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:33,379
of custom system whether it's Jekyll or

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,610
whatever to you know list out you're

00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,840
different you know the mark-up for your

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,119
different components and things like

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,499
that and then now we could choose saw

00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,869
guide so this one is you know you're

00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:43,669
kind of taking your production code

00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,369
creating another system that has those

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,019
elements and then you're just applying

00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,950
your production code against it so that

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:53,749
kind of allows you to be a little bit

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,679
more modular and their approach and you

00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,899
know ultimately things a little more

00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,249
flexible so happy cog has a good article

00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,539
they wrote about how they kind of use

00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:01,610
that approach similar to this for

00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,779
building a style guide for the ben &

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:08,720
jerry's style guide which you know was

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:11,659
for their new site that they built some

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,879
of the things that you you know reasons

00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,530
why you might take this approach you

00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:17,150
might not want the doc

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,010
tation to live inside the SAS you might

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,450
want it kind of in it you know if you

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,400
need more people to kind of work on my

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,710
documentation if it's all locked into

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,780
SAS files that doesn't allow allow a lot

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,190
of flexibility if you know you have your

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,710
writing guidelines or branding

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,850
guidelines and you you know then you

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,820
kind of maintaining two different

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,230
systems right it works great for SAS but

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,000
it's not really great for those other

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,950
examples maybe you need some more

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,090
flexibility in your environments or

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,200
maybe you need flexibility about how

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,340
your designers and developers work

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,950
together so then happy cog article a

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,330
kind of talked about how you know one

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,500
person was able to just jump in and

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,970
start designing and building the site

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,190
and then another designer was able to

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,040
kind of leverage that code to then kind

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,600
of you know throw it into a Jekyll site

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,830
to then provide documentation and build

00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,330
a style guide you know as the site's

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,810
kind of being built so that's kind of

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,880
cool and then if you want to take your

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:09,890
style guide to the next level there are

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:12,410
these people so sales force has a really

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,660
awesome UX team and they wrote this

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,020
great article on medium called how to

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,850
create a living design system they put

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,860
the you can access their style guide

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,450
online is really great and they bought

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,280
built this really cool tool called Theo

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,930
that's up on github and when they

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,490
basically you know I'm not without going

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,910
into too many details they basically it

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:37,940
can take JSON input and then an output

00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:39,680
SAS less stylus code for Android and iOS

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,750
apps so they built it's like one

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,520
reporter repository for all their design

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,720
properties that they can then pour it

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,430
out to all their different web

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,130
properties and apps so it's really

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,510
advanced stuff again lawl so lonely

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,130
planet is doing really cool stuff where

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,010
they basically created this the sky in

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,270
feather who's saw a guy genius a wrote a

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:01,070
great article called the maintainable

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:02,480
style guide and there is there saw guys

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,100
really cool and they built a thing

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,870
called the component API which kind of

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,450
as it sounds turns their style guide

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:12,940
into an API that then their application

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,650
can reference so check out those links

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,960
another common question I get asked is

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:22,880
what if I already have a site and I want

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,620
a style guide for it right so I think

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,030
there's kind of two approaches and they

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,950
kind of leverage the ones I talked about

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,909
I think using kind of a hybrid approach

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,539
is easier

00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:33,379
because you've already got your

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:35,899
production you know your production SAS

00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:38,599
if you just build a quick like juggle

00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,619
site that has you know maybe not all of

00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,950
our components but you start with the

00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,210
basics typography you know colors you

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,309
know to get those things in there may be

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,139
a couple of other your common components

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,039
you know you just throw that markup in

00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,899
there that matches what you have the

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,279
production site as long as it's reusable

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:54,499
or at least here at this point you're

00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:58,249
setting up the mark-up that is going to

00:24:54,499 --> 00:25:00,590
become reusable and then you know you're

00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:03,289
deploying your production SAS directly

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,700
against the style guide and of course

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,259
you know as you know you could start out

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,399
very basic just culture biography and

00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:08,840
then as you want to build out more

00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:10,609
patterns you can do so so this is kind

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,849
of the easier approach I say the harder

00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:15,559
approach is going as using a generator

00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:17,749
is this involves you going through every

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,190
piece of your sass if it's all broken

00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,919
out into components and part you know

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,749
partials components that might be easy

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,039
but if it's not your sass isn't really

00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:26,869
structured already that might be more

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,609
difficult but even if it is you've got

00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,129
to go through each one right in you know

00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:33,320
the chapter got you know chapter

00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:35,299
headings descriptions putting in you

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,019
know chapters and subchapter numbers all

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:40,669
that stuff so it's more time consuming

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,220
but in the long run it's more

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,259
sustainable so yeah you've done all that

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,999
legwork then you're in a good place to

00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,649
you know assuming you want to go the

00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:51,049
generator approach it's going to be more

00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:56,029
sustainable long run of the leg work up

00:25:51,049 --> 00:26:00,470
front so I'm gonna transition is talking

00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:02,809
about best practices here put it online

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,359
and easy to find so you know make it a

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,919
simple URL to go to if you're

00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,320
comfortable doing so I encourage you

00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,149
make it public just because people hate

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,409
having to go through users you know

00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:18,529
logins and passwords and stuff like that

00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:20,599
again you know your website isn't a lot

00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,340
of secrets you know you can just view

00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,989
source a lot of time so you know who

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,099
cares if people can see you know the

00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,720
code they're using to build your website

00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:29,239
a lot of times is that stuff doesn't

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,249
really proprietary stuff so i would say

00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:33,499
big advantages you know everybody in

00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:35,179
your team no matter who they are having

00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,799
them be able to just go to a URL to find

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:40,729
this documentation is going to be a big

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,839
one for you make it for everyone so it

00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,860
doesn't it just had to be for designer

00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,330
it's a great tool for

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,179
designers and developers to talk to each

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,320
other but can you imagine like you know

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,540
account manager a project manager

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,160
talking to you know the product owner

00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,870
for your website and being able to use

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,220
this style you know you know maybe the

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,450
product owner can use your style guide

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,549
is actually like a way to talk about

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,170
like oh well I like the way this page is

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,460
laid out but I want to change it you

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,480
know or I like this component what if we

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,620
move this Capone over here it's like

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,929
they have the building blocks now

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,190
they've got the language you know to

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,280
talk about it so you know there's a

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,600
business case for it it can make you

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,770
know just the management of projects

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,110
easier and then of course you know

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,160
designers and developers it really

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,490
streamlines you know how they

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,990
collaborate with each other really

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,940
important make it part of your workflow

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,490
if you decide to dive into the creating

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,490
these style guides you really have to go

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,690
all in for it you know it's not

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,250
something you want to like kind of try

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,809
out build a little bit because it's

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,980
immediately you're going to find it's

00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,690
not getting the attention that needs

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,130
it's going to get out of date and then

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,510
once it gets too far out of date then

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,000
it's you know you're never going to go

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,650
back and update it so really kind of

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,760
making it part of your workflow I think

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,919
you know is going to lead to those

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,020
advantages of you know reusing code

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,030
making you know the assets of your site

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,710
you know a lot more streamlined and you

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:55,130
know ultimately making your bill times

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,990
faster when you're building your

00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,220
components keep them general you're

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,309
really trying to aim for reusability

00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,080
here so if you're creating a you know a

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,490
carousel don't call it home page castle

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,059
because that thing can be used on other

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,710
pages right so you know keep the naming

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,960
conventions kind of general and you know

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:16,150
start broad and then move down to spot

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,679
you know more specific things kind of

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,770
going adding on to the other thing you

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,970
know make maintenance easy so you really

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,059
want to make keep this thing up to date

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,160
so if it's too hard to like add a new

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,750
component or add documentation or you

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,280
can't quite get the generator to like

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,260
throw things into the style guide like

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,669
that's no good because then you know if

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,669
it's hard to use no one's going to use

00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:38,990
it it's going to fall out a date and you

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:44,240
know that's going to prevent it from

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:48,559
becoming part of your workflow all right

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,000
Leslie I've got some resources here this

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,330
is a website that's prolly started last

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,760
fall and I think it's really amazing

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,090
because I had been researching kind of

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,580
style

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,100
for the past year poring over articles

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,419
and books and tools and kind of like

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,100
keeping my own running list of things

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:08,900
and then Brad Frost and a debe han dip

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,960
hem kind of put this website together

00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:14,090
and bam now you have all these great

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,919
great resources for this these style

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,909
guides all in one place I think another

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,370
thing that's really exciting about saw

00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:23,120
geysers right now is you know you know

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,640
starbucks created there's one in the

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,429
2012 but since then we've kind of seen a

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,260
couple ones sprinkling in and now we

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:32,299
have all kinds of examples so there's a

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,649
page on here that's got examples that

00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:35,120
just shows you all kinds of different

00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,860
like really you know big name companies

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,299
that are putting their style guys out

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,820
there they're writing articles about

00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:44,090
them they are putting the code up on

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,490
github so you can check it out so it's a

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,710
really really amazing resource and the

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,880
best part of it is that it's open source

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,840
so i encourage you to you know if you

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,370
are this is something you're interested

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,429
in if you write an article about it

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,620
you're free to throw it up into the

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,720
website if you have an example you know

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,309
we'd love to have it up there I've been

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,539
a real big fan of this repo and I've

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,149
been trying to contribute as much as

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,500
possible to it it's just really great

00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,779
resource that now all these kind of

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,760
disparate the ideas are kind of now in

00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:20,330
one place and there are a couple of

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,270
usability improvements I think he could

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,250
be made so you know if you're interested

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:27,380
in that if you browse the site and you

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,230
see things that make it hard to use or

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,580
inaccessible like I'm personally really

00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,020
interested in kind of you know making

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,370
this tool really really great in this

00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:39,140
really great place for the web

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,730
additionally Brad frost you probably

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,279
heard of he created a tool called

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,990
pattern library he kind of coined the

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,610
phrase atomic design so this idea of

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,250
like kind of component basis I break

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,200
down a site into the smallest pieces

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:54,799
he's now writing a book and it's in

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,809
process so he is kind of just putting it

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,890
up online it's in process you know he's

00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,720
just writing it kind of a chapter at a

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,809
time I think it's actually all in github

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,929
also if you care about seeing how you

00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:08,050
create a book in github so you can check

00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,870
that out

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,490
additionally they've created a podcast

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,300
and so I've listened to the couple of

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,220
the episodes and they're really

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:20,710
interesting so I listened to the first

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:24,070
two against its Brad and Anna they

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:26,980
interview Gina Bolton she worked on the

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,630
sales force saw guide so really what

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,010
this is doing is they're interviewing

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,310
these people who at these like really

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,810
major companies they are talking with

00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,270
their process or talking with pros and

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,480
cons how they got there you know bosses

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,410
to buy into this and it's really

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
interesting to hear them think about

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,620
their process you know how it worked

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,370
it's basically how it works into their

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:51,040
workflow and I listened to the second

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,900
one also it's Federico holgado he is at

00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,970
MailChimp so you've probably seen their

00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:58,740
pattern library also and he talks

00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,970
through similar things additionally I

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,470
that thing I talked about I basically

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,480
have been using github as my own

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,390
Evernote for researching a lot of these

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,060
things so I just have a repo called UX

00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,650
and I have a markdown file called style

00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,860
guide so a lot of a lot of these links

00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,350
are now in style guides thought I oh but

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:21,870
if you want to check this out also have

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,870
you glad to see it I think that is it

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,980
hit a button there check that out and

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,980
thank you

00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:49,000
so I'm sure we have some questions let's

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:52,090
get started okay we got weight of

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,570
organizing things and but most of the

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:57,730
witness of the times new team members

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,070
are added to the team or sometimes

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:04,450
designers just start building their own

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:08,680
CSS files right but I think that maybe

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:12,730
we shall include in the documentation in

00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,280
that style guide the folder structure

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,670
and what kind of styles will shall be

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,540
included in each of those files I would

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:23,680
like to get your opinion about this yes

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,340
I think you brought up to you really

00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,600
good points there one is I think the

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,820
main reason you're trying to see people

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,140
like MailChimp and Salesforce and people

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,690
like that because their big companies

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,070
Mel champ is like 300 people you know

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,350
they have designers leaving they have

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,750
designers coming on what a great

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,450
resource to have their style guide up

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,920
there and you know you want to train

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,050
people of course but if you have you can

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,580
point them to documentation about you

00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,830
know best practices here's how we build

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,510
our application here's coding standards

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,340
here's you know how all the designs are

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,630
builders or style guide you know what a

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,250
great resource are like an onboarding

00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,390
tool for you know new people right it

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,440
can kind of like get them started a lot

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,780
faster and a second point you know give

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,310
your guide a guide you know I think a

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,220
lot of these you'll see you jump into

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:11,140
them and then boom it's it's immediately

00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,640
you see patterns and you see code and

00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,440
they just jump in the code there's no

00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,990
explanation about when these things are

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,120
used or why or how you got here how to

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,929
modify them so yeah like you're saying

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,570
you know if you have a specific

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,210
structure for your themes or your code

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:28,030
standards you know guide people through

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,409
it you know because you know if it's a

00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,300
good guy that's going to appeal to a

00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:33,310
wider audience than just you know your

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,220
developers so you know you need to make

00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:39,100
it you know a good table of contents you

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,600
know give things descriptions and then

00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,220
yeah I think what's your point kind of

00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,030
including some of the softer stuff where

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,679
you know it's not a pattern you know

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,629
here's here's not yours you know so

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,149
here's it's not just a pattern with co

00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:54,009
it's like here's kind of our approach to

00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,460
building websites or building themes

00:34:54,009 --> 00:35:03,789
things of that yeah what size t-shirt do

00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:05,529
you wear no t-shirt anybody who asked

00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:07,960
the question can go pick a teacher ever

00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:11,230
their exercise now everyone wants ask a

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,329
question all right I just want to make a

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:17,200
little invitation there will be a buff

00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:20,799
right now and I kind of a prototype the

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,589
module which implements KSS not with

00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:28,779
Drupal and I want to show it and get

00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:32,559
some inspiration great check out that

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:34,690
buff have you worked with the Drupal

00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,039
style guide module at all our or tools

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,240
like that if there's a couple of modules

00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,039
and how to do is essentially the same

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,150
thing in terms of building style guide

00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,529
directly in Drupal do you have any

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,650
experience with those or any thoughts on

00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:47,440
those yeah we do have a experience of

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,930
that so I haven't used it personally in

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,180
a little while as I understand it's a

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,240
module you enable and it comes out with

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,569
some default output of you know kind of

00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,529
basic web elements so typography images

00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:01,329
things like that but then also some

00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:04,599
Drupal specific stuff so like movies

00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:08,950
like pagers or messages things like that

00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:12,970
I think the thing we found is it's a

00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:14,079
good tool to aid developers because but

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,730
it's not something you would ever show a

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,170
client so it's a way to like kind of gut

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,250
check your own work because here you

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,319
know you're building your site you

00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,750
create all your styles and then here's a

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:24,549
page that spits out every kind of you

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,319
know L web you know HTML element you can

00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,630
think of and here's kind of how you can

00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:30,460
like you know QA it to see if things

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,160
look ok I think we found out it wasn't

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,259
super flexible and like I'd allowed you

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,730
to kind of add things to it but you know

00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,230
wasn't structured at all i think those

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,759
are our kind of thing we didn't like it

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,369
was just kind of spit everything on one

00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:44,259
page so i didn't but i think that is a

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,940
good example of maybe the hybrid

00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:47,950
approach we're using your product in SAS

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:52,760
against you know in against kind of you

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:56,600
know custom HTML elements

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:59,210
how do i improve it I think I would look

00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,790
to see you know how some of these like

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:05,480
Jekyll style guides are structured how

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,920
they how they actually structured their

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,500
files because then it's kind of similar

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,640
to you know sass partials you know

00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,430
they're breaking down each component

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,790
into a you know maybe not marked down

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:19,670
file but like an HTML file you know but

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,380
it's keeping everything very separated

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,140
and like individualized so it's like

00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,220
easy to find within the code itself

00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,110
additionally that allows you to give you

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,550
structure in your actual style guide

00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,840
yourself so instead of just getting a

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,640
page that spits out all the elements on

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,460
the page you know you'd be able to you

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,560
know create chapters and subchapters so

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:43,130
I think that would go a long way and

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:46,370
kind of improving that module well the

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,010
recording oh the recording okay so what

00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,970
would be the one thing you would do to

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,120
incorporate the style guide into the

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,320
workflow like if you had to do one thing

00:37:52,120 --> 00:38:00,970
what would that be and who would you

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:03,770
give it to I think the biggest thing is

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,140
you know the style guide is not like

00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:08,050
written in stone it's not like here's a

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,790
style guide here's the thing that

00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,530
everyone must follow to build anything

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,660
you know you want to build a new section

00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,160
the site you want to use new components

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,230
too bad you have to use the existing

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
ones like that's not really what this

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,840
thing is for it's meant to be flexible

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,460
it's meant to be updated but your

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,530
approach I think should be for your

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,380
workflow is you know reference the guide

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,770
first see if you can use those default

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,060
components as they are and if you can

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,640
make it you know if the designers can

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,860
make a case that something needs to be

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,690
modified or you know you need to make

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,460
like an alternate version of it great

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,890
add to the style guide your building on

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,230
to you know the base thing and you're

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,080
creating you know I'll you know modified

00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,520
versions or if you revisit that original

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,500
component and you're like yeah we really

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,110
wrote that in a dumb way you know change

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,180
it right so it's not suppose to be

00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,950
written in stone you know it's like it's

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,570
a conversation starter it's like if we

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,090
can reuse it great then we want to write

00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,530
into more CSS if it doesn't quite fit

00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,230
our needs let's have a conversation

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:14,900
about it and you know maybe modify it or

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:16,520
build on it when looking at the SAS and

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,870
all the commenting that goes on and I

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,420
know how people love to comment their

00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:28,640
code how do you convince people to do

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:31,700
that then or who does it I would say

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,230
yeah you know I organizations are all

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,690
different you know a lot of designers

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,520
are digging into code now so I can

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,870
imagine a world where you know we're a

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,250
lot you know the designers are actually

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,450
doing this if they're right in the SAS

00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,780
they could be right in those comments

00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,310
also it's just that you know if you're

00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,050
doing a pull request and someone's

00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,550
reviewing that pull request if that code

00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,740
is you just kind of make it part of your

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:54,440
culture that you know if you're using

00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,060
this if this is a cool tool that you

00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,830
know you've all kind of bought into then

00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,720
you know you just have to kind of police

00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,640
yourselves into knowing that this is a

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,440
you know a good thing to have it's going

00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,060
to help you know onboarding it's helping

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,350
you build things faster and just make it

00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,210
part of your you know maybe your code

00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,370
review process that like okay you wrote

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,960
this a new SAS did you write

00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,030
documentation did you write in the right

00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,430
way did you check the style guide to see

00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:18,110
if it kind of you know was generated

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:25,670
into the style guided in a you know

00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:26,750
readable way hey um so one of the

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,970
biggest rooms we've had with

00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:32,360
implementing a separate style guide that

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:34,520
we import into our production site M is

00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,460
keeping the mark-up consistent the SAS

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,470
no problem and have you figured out a

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,180
good way of doing that or do you know of

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:46,100
any good ways of keeping the mark-up

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:49,250
consistent as well as the styling no um

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:52,490
I think I think that's a that is a big

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,620
problem yeah SAS is one thing but mark

00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,230
up especially you know yeah if you're

00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,630
just writing a static HTML site maybe

00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:02,120
that's easy but you know if you're using

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,110
Drupal or some other CMS you know how do

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,270
you make sure that's going to be

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:09,440
consistent um you know in the in KSS one

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,720
thing that's nice about that generator

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,890
is it's actually asking you you know I

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,480
don't think you have to but you know if

00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,220
you want to get best the most out of it

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,010
you know you want to write that markup

00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,440
in your SAT you know and not exempt that

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,829
button example you're writing

00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,359
button out you know HTML in the

00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:29,190
documentation itself and that's what

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,740
it's using the style against so I think

00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:33,670
KSS shows that markup at the bottom but

00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,750
the patient is like you know that

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,540
example I showed you know showed all the

00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:40,410
buttons and the bottom it was like you

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,460
know button elements class and modifiers

00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,599
but you know that's a really simple

00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,020
example you know if you've got something

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,160
like a view that's returning you know a

00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,359
bunch of teasers and things like that

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,079
you can met you know you can imagine

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,410
like it's pretty complicated so yeah

00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,410
just got

00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:06,440
okay who's saying you know just are you

00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,509
saying just put right the HTML and put

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,380
it into the documentation whether you're

00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:11,380
prototyping it or whatever

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,619
ok

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,490
okay so he's saying either you know take

00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,750
your if you're happy with output that

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,310
your bowl is putting out you know throw

00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,650
that into your SAS documentation for

00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,820
your generator or you know if you have a

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,920
specific way you want the mark-up you

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,610
know maybe you know a lot of times you

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,590
know if you're going with one of the

00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,940
other methods where you're you know you

00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,130
know the designer is saying okay here's

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,450
how I want a teaser to look and they're

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,980
writing the mark-up about you know where

00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,450
they want and maybe they know something

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,430
about Drupal so they can you know throw

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,950
in things like you know views and

00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,180
classes and things like that you know

00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,470
and then they're kind of you know

00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,330
setting what the market but like and

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,770
then the designer and developer can have

00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:11,750
a conversation about whether that's

00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:14,590
possible any other questions first of

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:18,500
all thank you for the D talk it's been

00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:20,750
enlightening a little bit we have been

00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,240
working with style guides but the old

00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,950
PSD photoshop kind of thing and now

00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,030
we're migrating to leaving stag lights

00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:31,550
and one of the four I stumbled up I

00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:35,270
think was your work will for kitchens it

00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,920
was a style guide of that sense it's a

00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:41,210
lonely or something like that I believe

00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,430
at one point I saw like some like

00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,290
Brandon color topography and like a

00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:49,730
month later I saw a whole different

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:51,920
thing or two months later and I find it

00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,200
really fascinating that you I think I

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,600
didn't really know which tool you use

00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,360
but it will be great if you could talk

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,460
us down a little bit I think what I saw

00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,270
that you built small components and then

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,150
somehow you build the page you seen

00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:09,590
classes from panels i think it was and

00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:13,880
like the layout of the page was like

00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:16,670
soggy it's okay um exactly how it looked

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,510
at the end if you could tuck us that

00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:22,910
about that okay he was asking about a

00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,680
style guide that we built for texas exes

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,320
it's an alumni organization for the

00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,550
University of Texas in Austin I believe

00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,900
for that project we use a tool called

00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,390
style prototypes which I mentioned

00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:36,320
earlier so previously we had been kind

00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:38,600
of using our own kind of homebuilts or a

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,370
custom-built Jekyll thing to you know

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,240
output our style guide that was our

00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,090
first

00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,400
time we use style prototypes have you

00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:49,369
ever looked at pattern lab they're very

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,869
similar so kind of pattern lab and sell

00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:53,780
prototypes going to use this atomic I

00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:55,190
actually pattern lat or sorry some

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,780
prototypes can optionally use atomic

00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,340
design in this Texas Exes example that's

00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,810
what we did use i'll make sure to like

00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,610
throw that example of that some that

00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:05,030
that's a good example of ours that I've

00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:07,930
it thrown here so it's using the atomic

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,750
design kind of philosophy so you know

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:14,030
atoms elements I forget molecules all

00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,560
that right so instead of kind of

00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,790
breaking it down by chapters that's how

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,690
it kind of breaks it down so you're

00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,080
starting with the very smallest

00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:23,480
components like a header and then you

00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,490
might put that into a larger component

00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:31,100
which is like a teaser so now you've got

00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:33,230
a header and you know like a image and

00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,020
teaser text and then you can actually

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,400
start to throw that into you know maybe

00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,660
a view where it's putting all those

00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,400
teasers and things and then now you can

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,330
throw those things into layouts so it

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,530
allows you to start with these atoms

00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,450
throw them into larger components and

00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,910
then actually throw them into page

00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:52,369
layouts without rewriting in that code

00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:55,850
because you're just throwing in you know

00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:57,560
like tokens you know that you've already

00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,170
built to build out these layouts and its

00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,490
really great prototyping tool because

00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,020
it's all responsive it has some other

00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,030
things neat things thrown into it like

00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,290
you know changing your viewports and

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,670
things like that dynamically without

00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:11,420
having to like click and drag your

00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,859
screen so i will say that style types

00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,119
like we found some prototypes a little

00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:19,280
bit challenging to work with but we did

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,410
like that it provided a lot of structure

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,690
and kind of had those prototyping and

00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:29,600
layout tools out of the box where our

00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:32,440
other tool do not all right I think

00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,440
that's it thanks everybody

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,710
