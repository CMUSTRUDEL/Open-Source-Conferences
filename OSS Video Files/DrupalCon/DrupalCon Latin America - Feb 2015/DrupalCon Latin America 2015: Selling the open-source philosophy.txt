	peakers: handrus larruda
This talk consolidates positive experiences in the inclusion of the open source philosophy (not only the open code) in proposals to big companies.
We will highlight topics about the open source philosophy using the drupal community as our example and talk about some common questions that clients bring about open-source and some answers that worked well for us.
We will show how companies can benefit in security and ROI by adopting open-source code, and by contributing back with code.
We will try to make this talk very participative, so bring your questions, experiences (good or bad) and let's share!
