Title: DrupalCon Latin America 2015: Selling the open-source philosophy
Publication date: 2015-02-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Latin America - Feb 2015
Description: 
	peakers: handrus larruda
This talk consolidates positive experiences in the inclusion of the open source philosophy (not only the open code) in proposals to big companies.
We will highlight topics about the open source philosophy using the drupal community as our example and talk about some common questions that clients bring about open-source and some answers that worked well for us.
We will show how companies can benefit in security and ROI by adopting open-source code, and by contributing back with code.
We will try to make this talk very participative, so bring your questions, experiences (good or bad) and let's share!

here is based on some experiences that

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:08,410
we had on trying to sell open source

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:10,840
solutions to big companies ah there's

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:15,940
also one to tell you i'd like to point

would give this presentation with me but

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,610
he would not be able to attend because

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:29,410
some missing documentation that he could

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,800
not get ready for for going to columbia

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,410

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:41,910
vasconcelos trying to take over and as

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,950
better as I can our pure hundreds I'm

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,150
software architect and developer at

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,850
Tyler a Drupal shop they sit in on

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,750
florianopolis brazil working with open

00:03:51,850 --> 00:04:00,310
source and agile communities for a while

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:04,060
and i think it's a it's like almost

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,370
eight years on the road and doing web

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,100
development and working with software

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:15,850
and especially with Drupal I'm working

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:19,200
like almost six years so as as Lucas

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:22,240
said we are trying to share some

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,810
experience about how to sell their

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,919
philosophy of a personal open source and

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:33,070
give some advices and tips that help you

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:39,190
to achieve your goal of selling open

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:47,950
source well so everybody already knows

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:51,340
that it's let its definition of the open

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:56,860
open source initiative that is is

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:59,800
basically you we have to to know who

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,919
what is the open source flaws of what is

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,920
it what is open source actually so they

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,120
open source initiative define

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,930
that the goal or the promise of open

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,160
source is harnessed distributed pure

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:22,150
reveal in order to guarantee quality

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:27,210
reliability flexibility low cost or cost

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:31,990
control stability and end of the vendor

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:35,770
lock-in so we have to take in mind that

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:40,330
the the go of the open source is to have

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:43,300
like software that can be done by people

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,480
that passionate about this and that have

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,360
lots of quality because we have lots of

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,510
people looking for this and we don't

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,240
have like one single vendor working with

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,790
this and like locking you into a

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,710
solution that you cannot have like the

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:06,640
flexibility that the open source

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:09,850
provides to you so here goes a question

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,380
is that hard to sell open source do you

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:18,340
think it's hard to sell open source

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:24,840
sorry who is listen to you yeah I agree

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:27,430
with you so we try to we have liked to

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,110
refute some myths about the open source

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,150
because as you said the people that are

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,850
listened to us when we start talking

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,760
about open source trying to sell some

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,760
solution based in open source there are

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,330
some myths that way we have to bust them

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,250
in order to start talking with like no

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:54,880
prejudice or like a really clear vision

00:06:51,250 --> 00:07:00,550
of what is the reason about the open

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,580
source and why it's like the most the

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,580
most

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:14,110
appropriate solution for in order to

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:14,110
have quality flexibility and low costs

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:22,369
okay so the first myth that we usually

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:26,269
hear from people when we are talking

00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:30,169
about open source is that open source is

00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:32,869
insecure okay and let's talk a little

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:36,219
bit about this why people think that

00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:39,740
open source is insecure there is this

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:42,229
general talk on mainly on people that

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,679
are not use it to the open source future

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:48,319
and they the first thing one of the

00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:51,979
first thing that they hear is that open

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,769
source is a code that you that anyone

00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:58,249
can change right that you are free to do

00:07:54,769 --> 00:08:00,529
whatever you want so if anyone can

00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:03,949
change people start to think that

00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,579
perhaps a hacker are some bad intention

00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:14,509
people can be there and insert a

00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:18,709
malicious code or a code that will we

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:22,669
will insert a a bug or a security breach

00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:25,369
and stuff like that and actually this is

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,349
not true because all open source

00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:31,099
projects have what we call their

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:34,130
maintain errs right so in general these

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:37,509
maintain errs can choose whether or not

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:41,300
they can approve or reject a feature a

00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:45,139
pull request a piece of code that in

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,660
other people is trying to suggesting

00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:50,720
that this this code is inserted into the

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,630
original project so the first leaf that

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,170
we need to refute is that not everyone

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,269
can make changes to the code okay

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:03,889
everyone can suggest improvements bug

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:06,529
fixing enhancements but this usually

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,259
goes through an approval workflow in

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:13,329
which the maintainer can choose to

00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:17,110
approve or reject the change okay and

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:21,579
usually this is a strict process okay

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,880
and we're going to look at this further

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:27,850
in the presentation but you have to be

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,910
in mind that and and you can say that to

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,670
to your clients or your prospects a lot

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,640
of big companies big corporations are

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,160
investing on open sourcing are using

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,140
open source solutions and they would

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:47,620
certainly not do that if we could if

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:54,820
this would not be a strict process okay

00:09:47,620 --> 00:10:02,160
a the second myth is that actually we're

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:06,670
not we are in insecure yet security is

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,760
something that is not only to deal with

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:13,149
open source projects on proprietary

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,000
software that you have your code close

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,310
it you can also find security breaches

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,570
right because you have a lot of ways to

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:25,240
test to do exploratory tests on closet

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:29,220
software's as well you can make

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,930
injections and a lot of other manners to

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,060
explore exploit security breaches on

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,320
securities our own proprietary software

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,540
so it's not mean that only by closing

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,820
the source code of your software this

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:50,339
means that it's secure right and we have

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,079
to remember that collaboration is when

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:56,170
thinking that it's very important for

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:59,050
security measures because when we have a

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:04,570
lot of people looking into the same code

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:08,160
base and trying to find issues trying to

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:11,170
fix that security security breaches

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,750
usually these resolutions are much more

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:18,730
faster that then a code of proprietary

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:25,690
companies that have their all release

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:28,029
times and not to mention that we have 30

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,790
fighters other vendors the community

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,660
itself much more interesting on

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,990
releasing those security fixes and

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:43,750
making the the solution more stable okay

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:46,450
and for certain paid software you have

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,180
also to pay for that security releases

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:54,550
and that's something that not happened

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,060
with open source okay so some still

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:03,900
saying that open source quality is low

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:08,080
but why do they say this actually um

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:10,630
personally I'm I don't I cannot

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,240
understand because I'm really involved

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,870
with the open source community so to me

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,900
it's like normal to see the quality of

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:26,490
the open source projects and solutions

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:32,500
but something that Lucas said is that

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:36,550
they have a fear of the of not having

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,310
control about like a vendor controlling

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:45,460
this code or the evolving of the project

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:49,990
because the business mans are like used

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,980
to think in the like the old center of

00:12:49,990 --> 00:13:02,080
how to sell products so they base the

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:04,590
arguments of selling in in the credits

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:11,200
that the vendor has in the market and

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:14,500
this can be a piece of point that you

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:19,330
have to mention that a vendor cannot

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,210
like guarantee actually they can but not

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,900
vendors can guarantee all the support

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:28,570
and quality because if you have a

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:32,320
software or a project that have a huge

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:35,020
community behind of it you have like too

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,590
many people that are able to support you

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,930
and provide your services and like

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,660
consulting or everything over the

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,450
software so again it's more people

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,060
looking at

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,610
code and there's lots of people

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,600
passionate and collaborating with this

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:57,710
software in order to evolve it so that

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:05,660
is the point we held a team dedicated to

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:09,770
do this so the Coverity report scan

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:14,810
report for open source and it's a report

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:19,160
that usually to run code analysis and

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:24,280
through projects that is open or

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:27,380
proprietary and it's used by NASA SI p

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,590
microsoft and some other huge vendors in

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:34,610
the market in the IT market and it wants

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,710
of the most reliable metrics about the

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:42,070
evolving of the quality of the software

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:46,670
so and the numbers of the facts forever

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:49,670
100 line it's the metric of the Coverity

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:54,830
scam report so you can see that the

00:14:49,670 --> 00:15:00,530
open-source had a point 59 and over a

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:03,560
point 7 22 and defects over 100 lines in

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:09,530
comparison with proprietary software so

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:14,510
we can see in the in this graphic that

00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:20,530
the curve of the facts that are fixed it

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:25,670
with over the time it's like really

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:28,760
really significant because the curve is

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,180
different because the open source in

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,430
order to have and the because of open

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,220
sores have too many people working with

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,500
this and they have to solve this problem

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,540
because they working in project that has

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:49,790
to be this fixes and they evolve faster

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:53,330
it's it's um it's it's something like

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:56,250
you have more people or more resources

00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:00,210
to solve the problems then you have

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,640
with a proprietary solution because they

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:05,970
have their limited there'll imitated

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,130
team team that can be like a large

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,550
amount of people but they have their own

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,940
priorities so the priorities of the

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:19,010
clients maybe not the same as as the

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,530
vendors so that's a point that

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:27,330
illustrate how the evolving of open

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:32,400
source it's more frequent and the number

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:34,230
of issues is really significant in

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,620
comparison with proprietary software

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:42,840
just because of the arguments I already

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:45,570
said so the Coverity is kind of report

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,110
of open source and said that eight out

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,740
of ten people surveyed our choosing open

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:56,120
source based on quality so it's like

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,620
it's it's strange because as people

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,740
choose open source because of the

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,680
quality people still saying that open

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,520
source it's like has a poor quality so

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,000
why can do understand this affirmatives

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,150
in order of having these numbers about

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,650
how many people are choosing open source

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,630
based on the quality of this the

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,209
software the solution so open source

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:29,340
code quality cervezas proprietary code

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:31,830
quality in C and C++ projects according

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:38,400
the Coverity whiskey scan report for

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:42,570
open source and also if software is

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,340
eating the world so then open source is

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:49,260
leading the charge so it's a phrase from

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:53,760
zacks mo cha a senior director of

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:58,520
products of Coverity so it's like it's a

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,280
vision of the future because the the

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,820
week today we can see and the numbers

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,309
prove that that the open-source have the

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:19,790
the right place and is getting more

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:23,809
into the IT market over the years uh the

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:27,650
first the the third myth that we usually

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:31,190
hear is that if you have a lot of people

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:36,290
working voluntarily for an open source

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:39,080
project so does it mean that this

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:42,950
software doesn't have does not have any

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:47,150
owner right so it gives the impression

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:51,590
that there's no one to actually claim

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:55,490
for when something bad happens so there

00:18:51,590 --> 00:19:00,230
is no company behind that softer to to

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,940
art with or to complain because actually

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,030
it's a bunch of people working

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:09,020
voluntarily to evolve that software on

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:12,530
their free time and whatever they choose

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:16,570
is that doesn't work that way actually

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:20,450
we have a bunch of companies that offer

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:27,080
qualified technical services and

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:30,620
supports 24 x 7 365 years per year on on

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,220
these softwares on a lot of on top of a

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,470
lot of open source software so you can

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,580
see for example canonical on top of

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:44,710
boonton and a crayon top of drupal's and

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:47,900
on top of PHP and more recently

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,600
microsoft on top of net framework that

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,600
has just been released it as an open

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,130
source project actually last week its

00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,320
core it's like the JVM for java so it's

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:05,179
the the virtual machine for dotnet was

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,520
also open source so microsoft is now one

00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,220
of the companies that are behind of an

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,830
open source project right now so we have

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,380
yes we have a lot of companies that

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,890
provide qualified support for open

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,770
source projects not to mention free

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,610
support that the community itself gives

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,429
for

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:30,710
so we have for example the m.i.a see i'm

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,429
no i'm not sure if you are use it to

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:38,570
that live chat platform a lot of open

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:43,220
source communities discuss within this

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:46,100
platform we have stack overflow so you

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,640
you can post your questions and receive

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:53,929
answers from the community and a lot of

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,690
people from that that companies that i

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:59,630
showed you our achieve lee working on

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,330
Stack Overflow you can see that they

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:06,460
answer questions and for free you don't

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:10,850
have to pay anything you have forums

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,179
internet forums you can discuss a lot of

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,280
things mailing lists online

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:20,590
documentation a lot of open source

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,820
projects have a fool and well documented

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:28,370
on their on their own sites so this is

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,820
resources that it's always available and

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:35,840
you can get it for free anytime you want

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:42,770
and that's something that usually only

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:46,370
on per source projects have but not

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,510
every open source projects have all

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,900
these things that we just told you okay

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:59,120
life is not a bed of roses and it's

00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:02,660
important to know which open source we

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:09,340
should choose to invest or not to give

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:12,679
our time on a we need to look at the

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,320
ecosystem that it's around this open

00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,630
source project because it doesn't mean

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,080
that just by open sourcing a piece of

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:24,470
code so you get your piece of gold and

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,700
put it on github and okay now it has

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:31,520
stability reliability an active

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,520
community no it's not like that you you

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,320
need to get to know the ecosystem that

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,159
it's around

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,429
an open source project and usually this

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,450
ecosystem has another name that it's

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:49,460
used to know by community okay so it's

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,679
very important important to get to know

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:58,549
the community around a certain upper

00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:01,039
source project let's recap a little bit

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:05,750
what we just dismiss that we just

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:10,000
talking about open source is insecure so

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:12,679
we we saw that actually it's it's not

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,460
quality is low we have some metrics

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,740
stating some protein matrix for Coverity

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,929
stated that the quality actually is

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:27,950
better for certain technologies and that

00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,509
nobody else no one supports so we have

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,700
the community support and we have

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:35,899
companies that are willing to support

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,690
for paid services so these are some of

00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:41,929
the initial arguments that you can use

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,570
to show that your your clients are your

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:49,159
prospects that they can start investing

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,470
on open source projects and I'm really

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:56,179
happy that we busted these myths because

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:58,519
we need to look at these arguments that

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:02,179
people say about open source being bad

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:05,179
or being not good solution and we need

00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:09,620
to be actually the Mythbusters of open

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:12,889
source so now that we just busted these

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,980
three myths here comes another question

00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:20,500
that's pretty much related to our

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:26,539
conference here is that hard to sell

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:31,279
drupal so I'll try to give some

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:35,990
information about how can you how can we

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:40,360
prove that there's if it's really hard

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:44,200
to sell Drupal because we have lots of

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,200
methods or like

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:51,250
tools in Drupal project and Drupal

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,159
community to enforce the security of the

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:59,230
system so we have a security team

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:05,700
dedicated to find and correct and fix

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:09,279
the bugs and it's they are really

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:13,659
dedicated to it to it so if you can find

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,419
a bug or like a critical issue in a

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:20,409
module that can be a security issue you

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:23,309
can note get the notes about about this

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:27,510
and they will help you to solve this and

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:30,820
and when it's sold they will open the

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,010
new release of the module in order to

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,360
prevent like attacks during the

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:43,149
correction so we have also peer review

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:46,480
so it's it's it gives us more secure

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:50,110
about the code because it's not like one

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,080
person doing everything and anyone else

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:56,080
can look at the code and say oh it's not

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,860
like in our standards oh you should do

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,909
this because it more efficient so the

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,010
peer review is a matter that can improve

00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:08,919
the quality of the software and

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,120
guarantee the Drupal security we have

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:16,559
also the peer review SHP script so it's

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,880
a I script that we run over the code

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:26,500
trying to prevent bad patterns and and

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,929
in trying to guarantee the quality of

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,890
the code and the standardization of the

00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:37,870
solutions by running aesthetic code

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:40,990
analysis and things like that we we also

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:44,529
had lots of automated tests in order to

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:48,340
guarantee the data features is working

00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:52,450
and everything is on they should be so

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,649
we have these mechanisms that guarantee

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,230
the security of the Drupal project so

00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:00,770
this a

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:07,850
is a really good argument to use in

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:13,010
order to prove the security of Drupal so

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:17,299
we have in the Drupal lots of mechanisms

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:21,200
that we use with the priv SH is great

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:25,280
and patterns that prevent the major

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,179
flaws that a software can have so we

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:31,100
have Prevention's for injections

00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:34,130
cross-site scripting session management

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,640
and cross-site request forgery that was

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:44,990
the most common security security issues

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:49,210
on projects today so some some projects

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:52,429
some companies actually think that they

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:55,520
would be more successful if they try to

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:57,799
build their own CMS we heard that a lot

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,419
of companies start building their own

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:05,630
CMS and actually they need to deal with

00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:10,640
all these security issues by their

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:13,970
selves okay and drupal has a prevention

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:19,030
for all these major security issues for

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:23,360
those top 10 OS vulnerabilities by

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:27,130
internally buting on its own so you

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,929
don't have to worry about any of these

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:35,240
security breaches because Drupal already

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:39,850
use with that pretty much right yeah so

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,490
we have more about Drupal security so

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:46,580
you have vulnerabilities tests like Vera

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:53,690
code inequalities so it's like a really

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:57,169
well no names in the security track or

00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:01,460
security industry so we have is Drupal

00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:04,669
secure website in order to show all

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,640
these arguments if you need to get more

00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:09,980
information about it you also have I

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,309
really use

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,790
case study that White House switch to

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:20,240
Drupal so it can be a really and a good

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:25,820
argument to sell in Drupal because it's

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:28,790
one of the most attack at websites in

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,419
the world so if they are using Drupal it

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:35,000
it it should mean that this is the

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:41,090
Drupal is secure don't you agree with me

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,410
I think so we also have to say that

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:49,130
Drupal is PCI compliance so we have all

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:52,549
these arguments that proved that the

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:55,760
Drupal is secure and we have all these

00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:57,650
mechanisms to burn guarantee list yeah

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,500
we are going to share the this

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:03,370
presentation and most some of these

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,760
topics are leaking linkage to external

00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:12,140
references so for example these PCI

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,169
compliance is linked to an external

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:18,500
reference which describes how Drupal

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:22,970
deals with transaction and payment

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:26,299
information in how this is really secure

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,880
and you can build for instance in

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:33,290
e-commerce robust solution on top of

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,049
Drupal with no no issues concerning user

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:40,640
and credit card information and stuff

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:44,360
like that well and we have to say also

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,400
about the quality of Drupal so what is

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,400
the mechanisms that we have to guarantee

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,470
this quality we have coding standards so

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:56,570
we have a well know working agreement to

00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,260
into the community to work and

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:04,640
contribute with Drupal so this is a way

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:07,130
to prevent the chaos of the project and

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,520
it's guaranteed equality we have also

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:13,750
the peer review also it's it's helps in

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,200
the quality as i said the peer review

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:21,110
script and also the automated tasks but

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,799
the thing is that the quality

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,799
is directly related by our community

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:33,500
because we are a huge amount of people

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:38,299
there wants to have a really good

00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:44,350
software and we have the will of making

00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:49,790
this more efficient and and have really

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:53,830
good software in terms of quality so we

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:57,679
have some showcases that could help to

00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:03,200
illustrate the security and the quality

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:07,160
of Drupal so we have something some good

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:11,030
nough really well-known names like ing

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:15,190
or the White House the economy's pay

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:17,929
Paul Jones own and all of these

00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:22,010
well-known names in the market that

00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:26,750
choose Drupal and it's based on his

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:30,110
quality and security and one of the most

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:34,820
common approach that I suggest you to

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:38,330
take is trying to figure out a good case

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:42,169
and mainly vertical to the same industry

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,970
industry of your prospect of the client

00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:47,419
that you're going you're trying to

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:51,620
achieve that project and show them how

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:54,679
dare these projects are working on on

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:59,480
these websites so if you were trying to

00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:03,650
sell into a healthcare industry you have

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:07,880
pretty much excellent cases on johnson

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,059
Johnson and Pfizer for instance if we're

00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,970
trying to sell for a nation industry we

00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:19,540
have the ing that I'm going to explain a

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:22,880
little bit further so try to get a case

00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:27,950
to show to a client from the same the

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:32,600
same market share and it's very

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:35,110
interesting that ing adopted Drupal on

00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,110
its

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:43,710
Lucius stack and we have this article

00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:46,409
here on trees blog and it's very

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,179
interesting this first sentence of his

00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:50,520
which is you know when a piece of

00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,260
software is major when you start being

00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,970
adopted by financial services

00:33:52,260 --> 00:34:00,679
organizations y which what does that

00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:05,309
mean usually financial organizations are

00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:09,349
very end strictly traditional so it's

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:13,619
very hard for them to change and mainly

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:18,599
to adopt a solution that has all these

00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:22,369
myths and in discussions concerning

00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:27,419
security stability quality and so on so

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:30,480
we can say that if this traditional

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:33,570
financial organization really adopted

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:41,879
invested on top of Drupal it's certainly

00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:45,480
it's a very major platform okay so in

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:49,980
order to empower your pre sales process

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,580
even more most of people forget that we

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:58,530
have also Drupal comp website which has

00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:02,839
a more commercial appeal more per sales

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:06,330
appeal so I suggest that you visit

00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:10,530
eurocom and you get to know a lot of

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:13,560
references on in arguments and cases as

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,750
well that will try that will help you

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:22,560
convince your kind to adopt this

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:25,770
platform so and and you have another

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,230
argument that you can use and it's make

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,170
really difference when you're trying to

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:34,980
sell open source that is you're getting

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:37,950
a lot of things for free so in the

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:42,960
Drupal case we have and in case of

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:45,810
Drupal we have more than 3,100 modules

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,110
so they are piece of software that was

00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,870
developed by

00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:54,970
some a company that needed this solution

00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:57,340
and they use that their resources in

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,890
order to build these modules and

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:03,940
contribute back to the community so you

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:09,190
doesn't have to recreate the wheel so

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:12,730
it's almost every every piece of

00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:16,860
software that can you can use to solve

00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:19,630
your problem and you have 30 hundred

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,600
modules that can help you with it with

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:28,470
this you also have twenty four point one

00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:31,930
hundred themes so it will help you to to

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:35,530
start the development of your solution

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:38,320
and you can also choose an contributed

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,200
team in order to doesn't have to build

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,200
your custom theme if you if you doesn't

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,050
have time or if you prefer so it's just

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,420
for free you have like thirty seven

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,110
hundred developers working with Drupal

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,240
and you get this support in for free

00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:00,040
because if you're using this software

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:04,240
and the there this these developers are

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,940
working with you so you had a lot of

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,450
people and support for free you have

00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,480
also two point five hundred comments per

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:16,660
week so it's like a huge amount of code

00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,570
that you have that you get for free and

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,900
you have a five hundred issue comments

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,720
per week so it's a project that and have

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:30,850
lots of discussion and the collaboration

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:36,280
is really important and it's all all

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:40,540
these things are free to try to charge

00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:44,320
and you get this your clients can start

00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:48,520
from zero with all these things and they

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,690
doesn't have to pay nothing for this yes

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:55,810
the point here is actually a client love

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,790
to see numbers so what the message that

00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,580
you should give to a client when

00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,580
presented these numbers is that

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,790
you actually can reuse a lot of things

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:09,760
so a lot of things are already Butte and

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:13,410
ready to be used and what does that mean

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,800
does it means a faster time to market

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:21,940
they also love that sentence and it

00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,850
really means that you are going to build

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,510
less things from scratch ok we are going

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:32,680
to reuse a lot of stuff and end the

00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:35,920
project are in a faster time line and

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:40,560
that's really a good very good argument

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:45,910
I'm trying to sell triple yeah so and

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:49,750
everything can be more an even better

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:56,320
because we have like more than 1 million

00:38:49,750 --> 00:39:00,310
people in 2229 countries speaking 118

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:05,680
languages in this project so we have a

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:08,740
really mature solution in meaning of

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,520
multi language and support in your

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,800
language and at your time because we

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,130
have a lot of people working all over

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,980
the world and this support can be used

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:29,260
for free in the forums and IRC and other

00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:33,910
tools that you can get this to any that

00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:38,230
you can use that to prove that they will

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:42,820
have support by the community and 11

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:45,580
more interesting thing that you can say

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,870
to our client and it's nothing two to

00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,790
think about is if you are reusing a lot

00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,750
of stuff from the community and we have

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:58,000
those huge numbers of people actually

00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:00,670
working on these projects don't you

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,440
agree with me that they are indirectly

00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:08,440
working on my project for free ok so yes

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,710
we are going to have people all around

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,770
the work the word working on those

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,530
models TVs and

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:19,740
told that i'm using on my project trying

00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:23,610
to improve then fixing security breaches

00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:28,400
bug fixing and I'm not paying actually

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:31,440
nothing for that yeah and there's a

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,970
utimate sentence in the Drupal community

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,670
that is that is a module for that so

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:44,100
what is what it does what it means

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:48,030
actually it try to represent the power

00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:50,940
of reusable reusing things through

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,720
modules names and this kind of stuff

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,610
because you have a lot of developers

00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,780
working with this and you just have to

00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:05,730
get and put in production so it's helps

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:10,650
you to tranquilize your clients because

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:15,060
they have the known that they already

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:19,260
have a lot of software that is right

00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:24,540
ready for production so you will you

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:27,540
will save time and save money and all

00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:30,960
these existing pieces can be put

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:34,140
together in order to make a better

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,650
solution for the client's needs so it's

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:43,320
it's like it's like it's starting with

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:46,170
almost the final solution even if you

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,410
didn't start developing because the code

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:54,210
the modules and everything already ready

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:57,840
ready and respond to using your own

00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:02,310
solution that its in-house and nobody

00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:05,760
else knows about it you were using in a

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:08,580
lot of more than a million people are

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,860
using the same models and solutions all

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:15,960
around the world so it's it gets a time

00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,710
that this solution the solutions are

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,520
very well tested and reliable because

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:26,400
simply a lot of people are using and

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:30,660
reporting and fixing them involving them

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,809
and anyway have another thing that you

00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:38,910
can use that is the Drupal lightning

00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:41,609
profile so some of you that may have in

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,910
the Aqua partner summit and the first

00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:49,410
day of the conference could see the

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:52,829
product and it will it was billed as an

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:56,640
aqueous sales tool and it's a demo

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:59,460
framework that you can use to show these

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,180
comments in scenarios for your clients

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,500
so in order to show to to show them that

00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:12,299
Drupal has are already really mature

00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:15,240
solutions or products based on different

00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:21,960
industries so you can have like internet

00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:25,549
already already ready to use like you

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,260
have also commerce solutions you have

00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:30,869
searching solutions we have

00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,230
responsiveness you have mucho lingual

00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:37,349
and all of these things is already there

00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:41,640
and for free for your clients so it's

00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:44,220
perfect to show your clients how Drupal

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,210
can be awesome and what Drupal can do

00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:51,470
for them any anyone here already uses

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:56,789
the demo framework near / sales process

00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:59,369
you nobody ends do any of you use the

00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:04,339
demo frame you work on your pre sales

00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,339
process already know so

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,309
so i really suggest you take a little

00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:22,059
time and take a look at the this demo

00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:25,420
framework you can just download it it's

00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:30,099
a Drupal project so drupal.org / project

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:33,099
/ DF from demo framework and during

00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:37,989
installation you can choose among a list

00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:41,799
of profiles which bring you a foo

00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:45,400
working platform with dummy content to

00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:49,749
show your client all the power that

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Drupal gives us okay so this is not to

00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:58,589
set this was using by aqua to as a sales

00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:02,470
to and it's now available for us to

00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:05,019
leverage it and show our clients what

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,749
you can do for commerce for multilingual

00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:11,579
responsiveness and all that kind of

00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:14,880
stuff it really it really helps to

00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:20,039
visually show the present to the client

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,869
this kind of stuff added drupal.org

00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:26,349
website so it's a project like a module

00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:32,640
so it's stupid org slash project is lash

00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:32,640
DF from demo framework yeah and it

00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:42,450
it's like a drupal distribution so it's

00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,069
a Drupal installation with a lot of

00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,400
buting modules from the community

00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:55,319
already configured to to a specific a

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:58,079
showcase and uh this is also one very

00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,650
important thing if you need to help on

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,680
trying to sell to report your clients

00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:09,059
partner with a crea okay because they

00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:13,530
can help you a lot as a co selling

00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:16,770
process and we talked a little bit about

00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:20,760
these on aqua partners day on this

00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:25,530
Monday and we had a case by Raphael

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:28,829
cecchini from just digital in he told us

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:31,079
how good it was to partner with rakia

00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:34,650
because he has a small kind of small

00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:37,650
company and aria is helping them a lot

00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:40,549
on trying to sell Drupal to his clients

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:45,450
so they help you they help you with

00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:49,140
material with presentations meetings

00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:52,500
they actually can send people to help

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:55,920
you and go to the client and try to to

00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:59,160
sell that project so I really recommend

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,829
you to to talk with an accurate

00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:07,020
representative and try to make some

00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:11,450
partnership with them so let's summarize

00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,450
a little bit of just talking about

00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:23,160
security and quality of Drupal so we saw

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:27,109
a little data and some metrics that in

00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:30,480
that Drupal has a major workflow for

00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:33,180
accepting changes and has automated

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,329
tests and a lot of scripts that go

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:37,950
through off piece of code and giving

00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:42,200
feedback whether or not that code is

00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:45,599
really secure and has quality we also

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,300
saw that Drupal is being adopted by a

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,750
lot of large organizations

00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:55,830
so this gives us and our clients much

00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:00,930
confidence in adopting into our

00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:05,220
businesses as well in communities and

00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:08,910
support so we have some companies such

00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:11,010
as a Kia and a lot of community stuff

00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:19,320
that can help us than getting support

00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:26,190
for this bridge uh ok but ok we saw the

00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:30,120
project now what we are making money

00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:34,740
with Drupal right using a lot of stuff

00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:39,450
that the community gave us for free that

00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:42,240
other companies are paid for using their

00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:45,630
own resources and time and budget to

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,270
build something and gave back to the

00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:52,890
community and we are simply using them

00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:57,180
and having success with this stuff isn't

00:48:52,890 --> 00:49:01,080
just fair if we try to maintain this

00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:03,870
ecosystem as well instead of sucking

00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:09,060
everything from the community and giving

00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:11,670
not back so there's this drupal's Logan

00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:15,270
so when you access your product argh

00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:18,030
it's right below the trooper logo and I

00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:21,330
think this explains pretty much what I'm

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:24,090
talking about uh you came for the softer

00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:26,280
right so why not the part of this

00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:33,090
community why not be part of this

00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:34,800
ecosystem and help to maintain it now we

00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:38,100
are going to present some of the

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,610
advantages that open source project have

00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:44,030
and that you give you a little bit of an

00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:50,060
idea why you should care about

00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:57,030
maintaining this this future going on so

00:49:50,060 --> 00:50:01,050
we had a listing of points that can show

00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:02,430
the advantages that open source have

00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,490
that only opens

00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:08,819
projects have so they are they have

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:14,599
alignment with social values so people

00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:19,170
can feel like into the community and it

00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:22,290
gives us the notion of we are doing

00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:25,740
something better for for the next

00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:29,609
generations can I can you say so it's

00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:33,329
like really align with social values in

00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:37,290
order to to to provide a better things

00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:41,390
to the others so proprietary projects

00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:46,260
doesn't bring this culture this feeling

00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:49,859
so it can be used as an argument so it's

00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:56,190
like a way of thinking a mindset that

00:50:49,859 --> 00:51:04,490
you can use in order to to argh to your

00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:10,349
clients actually we have some different

00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:13,829
ways of dealing with this for example if

00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:17,670
you have to convince your manager are

00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:20,339
some means someone above you in your

00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:25,890
company's hierarchy that you should give

00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:30,270
back a suggestion that you can you can

00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:34,650
try to to use is look at the your

00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:38,280
company's mission credo and these kind

00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:44,160
of statements because usually and I had

00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:46,380
this experience each staging their most

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,589
of the companies that they care about

00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:53,940
the community that they are involved in

00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:56,780
a more generic way but this fits very

00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:59,430
well on Drupal community if you are

00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,619
involved if your company are involved in

00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:05,369
this community it makes total sense to

00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:08,099
help it grows and maintain it another

00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:11,099
another situation it's quite common for

00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:14,520
a large organization with large clients

00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:16,290
is that you're going to try to convince

00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,420
your client who

00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:21,060
has paid for the code that you are

00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,190
developing that you should give back

00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,520
this code to the community and he's

00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:29,870
going to ask you but I paid for this

00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,400
project I paid for this piece of code

00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:35,430
why should I give it back to the

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,500
community sir or other competitive

00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:44,280
industries or companies are going to use

00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:47,310
it ok but remember that 30,000 modules

00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,510
that you are using on your project that

00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:53,820
saved you time budget and resources many

00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:57,540
other companies paid for that as well

00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:00,000
and you can use that approach to many

00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:05,670
other companies use it their time their

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:12,720
budget and decided to help the project

00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:17,720
growth in the end so they they have

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:21,180
another thing that is like only in the

00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:25,650
open source mindset that we have a

00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:30,480
continuous improvement that you can rely

00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:32,940
because the the community is working for

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,090
growing the project and building a bird

00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:39,030
solution so this is like something that

00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:41,840
your client will get and it it will

00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:45,780
continue getting from the community and

00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:48,300
they won't have to they don't have to

00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:51,900
pay for this continuous improvement it's

00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:57,290
it's not like when you buy a software

00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:57,290
that you have to wait for the

00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:08,529
release the release time you cannot wait

00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:12,759
for the release time of the software

00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:16,449
because the the open source projects

00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:19,299
have a really sharp release time because

00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:23,949
there are so many people working and

00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:27,369
trying to fix all those things and make

00:54:23,949 --> 00:54:30,609
our build new features so it's the

00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:34,349
improvement is continues and the clients

00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:37,419
will get this with open source software

00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:42,759
you have also the possibility of working

00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:44,709
so open source allows you to to make

00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:47,439
changes if you doesn't like something

00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:50,380
and the client have the flexibility of

00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:53,079
doing this if they are working with open

00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:57,369
source projects or Drupal in this

00:54:53,079 --> 00:55:02,069
specific situation and it's it's also

00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:06,329
easy to identify qualifier the skewer

00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:09,939
skylabers because we have all these

00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:14,880
mechanisms mechanisms in the community

00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:18,789
that you can use as research for

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:27,869
identifying these providers or this

00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:27,869
these developers okay so

00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:39,090
sorry it's working okay it's working

00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:41,830
just a second I get lost here well so

00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:44,110
you have the flexibility of creating

00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,840
your stuff because in open source you

00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:50,320
can customize things because you have

00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:53,140
the code you can see that code so the

00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,900
possibility of creating new features

00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,120
it's an advantage over the proprietary

00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,830
software because your clients doesn't

00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:06,160
have to ask them or see if it's a

00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:11,050
prioritized feature or issue that the

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:15,130
the proprietary software the vendor is

00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:16,720
in mind this is all about freedom you

00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:19,630
know this is all about you have the

00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,660
possibility to change in order to feet

00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:28,630
according to your needs so it's really

00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:31,960
good advantage so we have LA and also

00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:34,990
faster issue his illusions just before

00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,090
because of the amount of the community

00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,970
and all the people that are involved

00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:44,080
with this project we also have great

00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:45,910
support because all of the passionate

00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,050
people that are working with the

00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:53,500
software way in almost everything of

00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:56,830
this advantages it's for free because it

00:56:53,500 --> 00:57:01,810
can it comes from the community so it's

00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:06,580
an it's a bow no a bonus that your

00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:15,160
client can take in when he is choosing a

00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:18,820
Drupal or an open source project in all

00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,810
of that just the paint on one thing so

00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:25,600
everything that we just said that these

00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:28,750
advantages that open source have all

00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:32,470
those belt those benefits that Drupal

00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:37,320
community and its major platform gives

00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:41,250
us uh it depends on one thing which is

00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:46,390
give back to the community so

00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:49,859
only doing that we are going to keep the

00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:57,670
project evolving and maintain everything

00:57:49,859 --> 00:58:02,109
that that keep this ecosystem around so

00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:11,200
alive and active okay thank you very

00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:15,670
much this is it so we would like to ask

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,859
you for evaluate this presentation so we

00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:22,780
can follow this link at the bottom of

00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:26,940
the slide and also give us your feedback

00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:32,260
about this presentation we it's one

00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:37,359
single question it's really very fast to

00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:41,400
to answer so we we start for open for

00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:48,790
questions so if you'll have a doubt or

00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:54,390
something I would like to know more

00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:59,339
about the Drupal security if one client

00:58:54,390 --> 00:59:03,819
asked for a security test for the

00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:10,589
development project in Drupal which

00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:15,099
steps can I can I make how can I do to

00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:19,359
to to show to my client the security in

00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:24,579
the Dail web page they droop our website

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:27,970
I know that I need to upgrade for

00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:30,490
example del the lace Drupal release this

00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:35,319
this is for security but I would like to

00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:39,130
know the steps for example model test

00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:45,210
security user security view security

00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:48,870
iron of its insist some some test222

00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:57,610
test the Drupal security

00:59:48,870 --> 01:00:01,570
in the brilliance actually a for drupal

00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:06,160
quality we saw that we have that report

01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:10,120
from karate which states interesting

01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:14,020
data about how Drupal quality is better

01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:19,000
compared to other other platforms in

01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:22,930
terms of security we presented some

01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,460
vendors such as very cold and qualities

01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:35,080
i'm not sure if you if you know them

01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:39,550
that also provide a mechanism to scan

01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:44,430
and analyze a bunch of of security

01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:47,500
measures but i'm not sure if they have a

01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:54,640
condenser report such as the one that we

01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:57,820
got and you can also use use cases in

01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,640
order to show this security because if

01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:03,640
you have like the White House choosing

01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,550
Drupal it's really nice argument because

01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:09,250
even though if you cannot show the test

01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:14,310
for your client maybe because they won't

01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:18,250
understand what they what actually do

01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:21,670
happening you have these use cases that

01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:25,330
is suspect successful histories about

01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:29,830
plain Drupal in large organizations and

01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:33,720
government and universities so it's it's

01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:37,930
easy to I think it's an easy way to

01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:41,130
understand how it it can be reliable

01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:44,410
because they're there these

01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:46,840
organizations health also this concern

01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:49,660
about security and quality and they

01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:52,620
still choosing Drupal over other

01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,620
solutions on the market

01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:06,470
yeah so so he's saying that a cure has a

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,090
white paper about super security which

01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:10,970
probably has some references regarding

01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:15,710
this the way that the White House case

01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:19,190
is very known it's actually because we

01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:21,980
just by presenting them is for most of

01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:24,440
the cases just enough to tell that turbo

01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,940
is kind of secure because it's actually

01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,480
one of the most attack at sides of the

01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:32,690
world if you need further information

01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,730
how would reach out for the security

01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,580
team they probably have much information

01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:39,950
about this that's 43 people and the

01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,640
presentation is linked it to these

01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:45,890
contacts of this gene and also you could

01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,440
contact valleys or vertical to see if

01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:51,860
they have searched reports as the one

01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,480
that we got from poverty in terms of how

01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:59,630
do you secure compared to other

01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:02,540
platforms my question is what do you

01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:05,690
think about projects that once started

01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:08,330
as open source but by the time goes on

01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:11,480
that there is another version that is

01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:15,280
paid and if you want a box fees for

01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,280
example you have to pay for it

01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:24,650
can you or can you ask again because I I

01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:27,760
lost some points of your question how

01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:31,670
about projects that start as open source

01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:34,340
but by the time goes on there is another

01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:36,410
a new version that is paid and if you

01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:42,220
want but fixes or something you have to

01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:50,300
pay for them we have a kind of recent

01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:54,670
situation directly as as you said which

01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,670
is my sequel right by Zico

01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:13,690
well actually I'm going to fir this 22

01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:17,560
Renato but whatever I was going to say

01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:19,410
is that in general what I see the

01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:22,390
behavior that usually happen when these

01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:26,200
Disick use you have an open source

01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:28,720
project and suddenly a company acquires

01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:33,220
it and decided to close its source right

01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:35,650
are certainly the community around will

01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:39,070
fork it and that's one of the advantages

01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:42,250
of the being open sourced and another

01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:45,250
project will grow at the same time open

01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:48,070
source this an example rear example of

01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:52,480
these is when Oracle acquired my sequel

01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:55,210
in my area to be turned out to be a

01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,630
forked project and if you look at

01:04:55,210 --> 01:05:01,870
benchmarks performance benchmarks um

01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:04,690
they are in general much better than my

01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:08,590
sequel itself that's now proprietary so

01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:11,650
it this is a the common behavior that

01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:13,540
happens when you try to close an open

01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:22,360
source project the community will grow

01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:26,110
it by itself it's okay okay hi this is

01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:28,380
water from from Columbus my question

01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:31,600
actually I mean I I noticed that

01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:34,660
drupal.org and Drupal the account so

01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:37,180
quite big different when you put the

01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,800
pictures right so let's put it on power

01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:43,380
of RuPaul's account so I belong to multi

01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:47,620
corporation quite big telecommunication

01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:50,860
quite big one more than 25 countries and

01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:54,400
stuff like that so in going for for me

01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:57,940
to sell completely the idea I always

01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,510
going to have to fight hard why did from

01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:03,370
the point of view that

01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:06,740
I had to provide you know no you're sexy

01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:09,890
Security's expressed on things like that

01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:13,220
it's like a engagement for my

01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:16,910
cooperation with RuPaul so the question

01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:22,250
exactly is resisted like a engagement

01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:27,050
process when a big corporation one to

01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:29,060
use your solutions with the corporation

01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,890
cell regardless you have to pay whatever

01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:33,710
you know like a kinda like a contract

01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:35,840
like a friendly contract even paying of

01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:38,990
course for the cannon scenario you need

01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:43,790
a bicycle enterprise it a nice you know

01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:45,560
if you're struggling stove LA I don't

01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:51,650
know CeCe sell illegal question Lord

01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:55,430
yeah I think so uh I'd say that when you

01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:59,030
are dealing with such a huge situation I

01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:07,390
would certainly involve area to help on

01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:10,660
this because come see

01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:15,530
I would certainly involve a cab because

01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:19,970
for instance we are at Zion T in the

01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:23,750
middle of pre sales process with a huge

01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:27,349
financial institution and yesterday some

01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:31,040
of our folks are were to Washington to

01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:33,160
give a beach and we invited some guys

01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:36,770
from al khair to come with us and

01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:41,569
present out that stuff in terms of

01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:45,200
hosting services and and and engagement

01:07:41,569 --> 01:07:49,130
as well and they have our really good

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,260
team of people that can certainly help

01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:56,150
you with all that stuff you need in

01:07:51,260 --> 01:08:00,680
terms of arguments and so so uh for for

01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:02,420
these more complex discussions I would

01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,970
certainly involve a queue there are

01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:10,010
behind off all of these and they you

01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:12,770
certainly know how to deal with it yeah

01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:15,640
my question is about the sometimes you

01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:20,000
have ideas from managers about

01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:25,250
incorporating licensed software into

01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,109
Drupal I'm making like a hybrid what is

01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:29,900
your position on that you know how you

01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:32,390
feel about that and and and what should

01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,949
be like usually the answer that you know

01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:35,949
we can provide back to my ears

01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:45,569
yeah for example they want to buy

01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:48,569
something just to manage elearning like

01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:52,650
online classes right but it's a licensed

01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:56,850
software that we have to pay to develop

01:08:52,650 --> 01:09:00,060
and they want then to hybrid that with

01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:02,370
our Drupal site right which i think is

01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:04,759
creating dependencies in the long term

01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:08,850
because power of the site will be

01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:11,279
licensed right we cannot really manage

01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:13,799
that code we don't own it so what is

01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,600
what is your position about like a case

01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:18,120
like that you know what would be a good

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,179
argument against that I guess my

01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,179
question

01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:36,130
I'll try to let me see if I can I could

01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:41,420
understand well your question so are you

01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:44,659
asking what our position about building

01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:49,069
hybrid solutions they are licensed so

01:09:44,659 --> 01:09:53,089
the you're you're saying that the client

01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:55,969
will don't like this hybrid solution is

01:09:53,089 --> 01:10:00,260
that the point they want to have higher

01:09:55,969 --> 01:10:03,730
hybrid solution but i believe is not a

01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:07,750
good idea because it's bringing a paid

01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:11,420
licensed software into our Drupal sites

01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:13,130
so it really creates dependency because

01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,020
now every time that we want to make a

01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:19,369
change in that license of where we have

01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:22,219
to pay for it but these a licensed

01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:25,460
solution is something that your client

01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:28,369
wants to to be used that you cannot

01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:31,099
argue with that they want but I'm

01:10:28,369 --> 01:10:33,980
arguing against I don't want it yet

01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:36,110
because I need more arguments I guess

01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:39,590
yeah sure I think I got your your

01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:42,739
question first of all I would try to

01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:45,469
search on an equivalent open source

01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:48,409
solution you know so imagine that it's

01:10:45,469 --> 01:10:52,099
an educational platform so we have

01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:55,190
Moodle for instance right and see if

01:10:52,099 --> 01:10:59,270
that if the functional requirements fits

01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:02,239
because a a part of platform a part of

01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:04,880
code and what we're going to do the

01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:07,400
solution is built on top of functional

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,829
requirements right so we try to map them

01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:15,760
and see if the bread man feeds are not

01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:19,300
on how much are going to work on on

01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,300
other place

01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:28,150
how much we're going to adapt the

01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:33,760
platform right uh you know that there's

01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:36,660
no how to run out run out of if your

01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:42,730
client you really want to use that and

01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:45,580
you know you're going to be attached it

01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:49,140
to that licet pledge form anyway I don't

01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:53,020
see how we can get out of this situation

01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:55,480
if it's a client's requirement you you

01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:58,180
can't art with right so model we

01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:00,699
consider Moodle right but what their

01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,980
argument is they say yes Moodle but you

01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:06,190
still have to customize Moodle one and

01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:08,290
that's going to be costly and two is too

01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:10,239
long so their arguments like nope let's

01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,670
buy this licensed software because

01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,440
they're faster is quicker and at the end

01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:17,350
of the day it's going to be the same

01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,719
money but you know my question is in the

01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:22,030
long term you creating these dependency

01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:24,430
because you will always have to pay for

01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:25,989
these particular you know leavening

01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:30,100
every time that you need to make a

01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:33,330
change yeah I think if the client

01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:36,460
doesn't have the OpenNet openness of

01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:40,380
trying to think different in order to

01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:43,540
see the flexibility that will get on

01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:47,320
choosing Moodle for example it's like

01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:50,620
you actually it's true that you you

01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:54,310
still have to customize some things and

01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:56,770
have liked to spend hours and and have

01:12:54,310 --> 01:13:00,150
costs over the building these

01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:03,010
customizations but you already have more

01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:06,430
support by the community of this

01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:10,449
software because you can hire someone to

01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:14,230
consulting or you can hire some well

01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:17,020
skilled developer that builds some part

01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:21,160
of this project in order to make these

01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:23,710
customizations and well as the you can

01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:26,969
you have the possibility to talk with

01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:32,500
these peoples with the peas people like

01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:33,640
one by one by one you you have you have

01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,940
like

01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,760
and it's easier to achieve this goal

01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:43,840
because you can talk directly with the

01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,810
expert that did that so it brings like a

01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:51,490
sense of confident using this software

01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:54,820
and if you have like obviously you you

01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:58,050
can compare the final solution that is

01:13:54,820 --> 01:14:02,140
proprietary you'll have license and a

01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:05,860
solution that is not like the real thing

01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:08,770
that you need but can be that if you

01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:11,920
like spend a little bit of money and

01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:17,670
time and the value that will get that

01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:21,160
you get with this it's a most

01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:24,190
significant then you choose like a

01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:28,540
proprietary software because they are

01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:32,020
not thinking in your specific case and

01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:36,040
you when you're using an open-source

01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:38,830
software you always could have a person

01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:41,950
that is concerned about your needs so

01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:45,240
you have this flexibility there's

01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:49,210
possibilities to engage some someone and

01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:53,820
the the contributions that this one this

01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:57,310
person is doing for you it's like

01:14:53,820 --> 01:15:00,240
returns to to them also because they are

01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:04,110
in an open source community and they are

01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:07,510
improving the software so everyone's

01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:10,860
gains you know it's a relation of gain

01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:15,520
and gang so I think you should have

01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:21,000
showed this to your client because as if

01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:28,980
they are like coming into an open source

01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:28,980
world they can have like they can bring

01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:38,500
recognition because the people that use

01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,900
this software will remember them also

01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:43,800
because they are contributing with with

01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:46,780
the evolution of this software you know

01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,320
just just to finish I think that this is

01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,570
much

01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,520
brother discussion you know but to

01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:55,000
practical things that came into my mind

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:58,119
right now first thing is i would go with

01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,800
comparison so either practically build a

01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:07,480
table of many subjects many topics such

01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:10,420
as how many people are are in the market

01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:14,349
so i could hurt you leverage moodle or

01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,659
these clothes at platform in turn in

01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:19,900
long term how can i extend these

01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:22,929
platform or not how much adoption each

01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:26,380
platform has right now in the market you

01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:28,810
know a lot of stuff and then i can

01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:33,790
present the pros and cons of each one

01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:35,800
and secondly i understood that some of

01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:39,070
the functional requirements that your

01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,010
client solution needs are missing on

01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:44,790
moodle but most of them are okay on this

01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:47,530
close at platform it's pretty much why

01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:50,679
the country is decided to use that the

01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:53,139
this platform right I don't know if you

01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:55,869
have already gone into a valley

01:16:53,139 --> 01:16:58,150
engineering process in each you break

01:16:55,869 --> 01:17:01,869
down all those functional requirements

01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:04,239
of this project and really evaluate

01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:06,880
which ones are actually the most

01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:10,480
important for the client's business so

01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:13,420
if you do that perhaps you can see that

01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:16,119
some of these requirements that are not

01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:18,310
building up or Moodle but are okay

01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:21,880
they're actually not so important for

01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:25,599
the the business right now and you can

01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:29,550
yes wait little more and leverage the

01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:37,780
solution in an amido or long-term basis

01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:40,210
no no problem any more questions so um I

01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:44,110
really appreciate everyone's here so

01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:49,510
here are our context 52 take a picture

01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:53,829
and we can talk further on this on the

01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:58,829
subject perhaps on different languages

01:17:53,829 --> 01:18:01,060
if you wish okay and please access the

01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:03,190
evaluation form is just one

01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:06,160
simple question you don't even need to

01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:08,040
log into the the form I really

01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,410
appreciate that thank you very much for

01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:14,550
for you being here and enjoy the rest of

01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,550
