Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: From Specification to Collaboration; one Agency's Move to Scrum
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	At Amazee Labs, we pride ourselves in producing awesome websites and making clients happy. In the past, we achieved this by sitting down with the client at project kickoff and laying the roadmap for how the project build would go. We specified everything, in day long discovery workshops. Then we'd tackle design, and finally, we would build. 

Clients were happy. Sites were pretty. But there was room for improvement.

In 2015, the Amazee Labs team saw an opportunity to improve our development process to better match internal and external needs. We adopted a Scrum-based Agile workflow which allowed us to work on multiple client projects at the same time without burning out our developers and still producing timely, quality code.

Since implementing Scrum, we eliminated the bottleneck of a single technical lead, specifying everything at the beginning of a project, brought clients and developers together, and improved the accuracy of work estimations

In this session, I'll share our experience of adopting Scrum as an Agile development framework, what's worked, what's been hard, and what we've tweaked to work for us. 

You will find out how we:

Keep organized, focused, and motivated while working on multiple projects 
Improved team communication and morale 
Handle shifting workloads (and vacations!) in an agency environment without impacting delivery or team happiness
Involve the PO in the living build process
Break down work into Epics, Stories, Tasks (project managers, this is for you!)
Estimate more accurately (and why this makes clients happy)
Run effective retrospectives with a distributed team 
If there's interest, we can schedule a BOF afterward so attendees can share their experiences of implementing Scrum in their own teams.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
all right it's 45 and I'm going to start

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,990
right on the nose because this is going

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,790
to be long so bear with me before I

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,469
start completely unrelated can I get a

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,440
show of hands how many people here know

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,910
what a maple bar is yeah that's what I

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,779
thought okay we can talk about this

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,550
afterwards all right so welcome to my

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,730
session my name is Stephanie I'm going

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,500
to talk about agile things if you look

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,840
the Milly schedule you notice this is an

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,820
intermediate session so if you're

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,910
expecting to be taught what scrum is I

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,649
apologize it's not going to happen but

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,070
what I will use this talks to talk about

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,140
is some pretty honest things about how

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,610
we do things at amazing labs some things

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,870
that we're not particularly proud of but

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,610
that's what happens when you're growing

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,500
and you're trying to become better you

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,480
share the things that you learn to the

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,520
hard way so that other people don't have

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,710
to experience those same things the hard

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,110
way so another thing that we're going to

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,399
talk about is we're going to go through

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,649
kind of some of the how we did things

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,820
and there will be parts during this

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,559
session where you'll have to do the

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,670
squinting game to see what I've put on

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,500
the board

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,090
don't worry afterwards I'm going to post

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,740
the slides and you can come and talk to

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,409
me I'm happy to show kind of the backend

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,259
the how we do things in JIRA if you have

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:19,020
questions so no panicking cool so the

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,840
first thing is again this will uh sorry

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,250
who here knows what scrum is okay

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,320
fantastic

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,259
who here does scrum or wishes they did

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,689
scrum okay cool so some of you who

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,630
haven't raised your hands buckle in can

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,869
be confusing so again this is not going

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,939
to be a how to do scrum talk this is the

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,299
how we did it at one point and how we do

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,430
it now talk this is going to be a little

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,470
bit of anecdotal it's going to be a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,049
little bit of real-life example so bear

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,149
with me as I try to explain things in

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,259
tiny piecemeal of things that are much

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,969
bigger I'm going to talk about what we

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,740
do what we've learned and how it's

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,020
worked for our team it's going to be a

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,850
little bit abstract in parts but

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,369
hopefully my examples will explain

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,469
themselves before I go into too much

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,060
detail I'm Stephanie

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,879
I work at a mazy labs as a project

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,000
manager we are based out of Austin Texas

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,830
hello

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,100
some of you might also know me because I

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,990
used to be Amanda from the Drupal

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,370
Association running Drupal con so my

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,510
name is sounds familiar that's probably

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,910
why alright so a bit about amazing labs

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,490
we are an agency that started in Zurich

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,410
Switzerland and we are now located in

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,970
Austin Texas and in Cape Town South

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,890
Africa so we're a little bit all over

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,960
the board when people ask how we pick

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,660
these locations I joke that we just took

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,610
some darts threw them on the board kind

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,230
of what looks like recently as of last

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,360
Sunday actually we all got back from

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,000
amazing 10 which was the amazing labs

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,310
10-year reunion celebration that we had

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,030
down in Cape Town South Africa this is a

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,260
bus of our 50 closest amazing buddies

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,900
and it was a really great time for all

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,610
of us to get together and see the faces

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,709
that we associate with slack names

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,180
during the week and just get an idea of

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,550
what people are like in real life so

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,470
it's really great this is sort of

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,010
culmination of what I will be talking

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,090
about so it's a little bit Tarantino

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:20,640
you're seeing the end to beginning so a

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,550
little bit about amazing scrum as it

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,980
once was I mean the labs is located

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,310
again in three different locations and

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,830
with this comes a couple problems we try

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,170
to be kind of a uniform team so not just

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,180
located and distributed but also working

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,459
together and independently and this

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,950
causes quite a few problems because

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,130
timezones locations cultural differences

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,660
work style differences Zurich started

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,000
first and so they had their own kind of

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,440
established rhythms and rules Austin

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,170
started and sort of did their own little

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,180
Wild West approach to all the things and

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,860
then Cape Town showed up and they just

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,110
wanted to play one of the problems that

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,989
we had is that each team sort of worked

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,930
independently and each team worked with

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,280
a project manager and a tech lead at the

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,830
beginning and this caused a lot of

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,720
problems so what would happen is all

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,790
that information was being bottlenecks

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,700
in those two people and it wasn't

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,650
getting to the team until much later so

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,169
when we would approach projects we would

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,700
have issues with specification coming

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,900
from one person so the team couldn't

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,540
actually be

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,010
work until tech lien has said here's

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,870
what we're going to do here's how we're

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,699
going to build here's the list of all

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,340
the things that you need to configure in

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,710
Drupal go ahead and get going so that

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,449
caused one bit of concern

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,130
another point is that it caused a single

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,780
point of failure that person who was a

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,820
tech lead could never go on vacation

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,460
because if they went on vacation

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,810
everything on the site broke which same

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,310
thing with a project manager if they

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,660
weren't there to speak to the client and

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,840
the client message never made it to the

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,139
developers and nothing happens so tons

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,300
of inefficiencies there as well the

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,710
other problem is that the tech lead and

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
the project manager had a great

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,680
relationship with the client but the

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,240
team who was actually implementing it

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
did not so there was no tribal knowledge

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,830
nothing to pass down and if you pass the

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
project to another group of people in

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,020
the team it was either no knowledge was

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,550
passed and so you were looking at this

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,650
build and saying I wonder why they did

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,669
that and talking to 17 different people

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,800
to figure out who was actually

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,410
responsible for making this do that and

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,750
that was incredibly inefficient as well

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,580
the other thing is that when we would

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,880
finally pass a project to someone else

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,710
in the team it took so long to get that

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,720
person on up to speed of what was

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,240
happening that it was almost not worth

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,610
it to pass the project on so these were

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,539
all little things that were problems

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,349
another problem with the way that we

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,510
used to work is that we we tried using

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,500
scrum we thought we were implementing

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,020
scrum we were quite proud of ourselves

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,030
but we didn't really have a baseline for

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,220
how we would approach projects so we

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,720
went from saying okay well right now we

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,539
have a tech lead and a project manager

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
and let's just do scrum instead we

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,139
didn't really do any training we didn't

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,180
really bring the whole team up to speed

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,650
we just said here's the project now

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,240
estimating how long that project is

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,090
going to take but the team kind of

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,770
looked at each other and we were like

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:21,720
seven no no so that was very problematic

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,910
obviously because we didn't know how to

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,650
communicate things the client we were

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,030
all like do we do it in story points I

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,039
don't know what a story point is people

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,810
keep saying things about t-shirt sizes I

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,130
just know how many hours I think it's

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,000
going to take and so there was a lot of

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,000
disconnect there as well

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,940
another problem with the way that we

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,889
scrubbed was that we had multiple

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,830
clients we don't have luxury currently

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,780
of having just one giant dedicated mega

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,750
client who allows us to do scrum and the

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,840
way that scrum should be done and so we

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,669
had clients who we would do scrum with

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,849
where you have the scrum ritual of a

00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:59,710
start and a stop but we started and

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:01,840
stopped with each of the client and on a

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,210
different day and so what that ended up

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,919
doing is creating a start a sprint start

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,509
almost every day of the week and a

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,889
sprint end almost every day of the week

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,780
which made the team very sad it also

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,520
made it really difficult for the for

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,509
planning because the people the clients

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,180
that we had at the beginning of the week

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,349
got obviously the bulk of our time and

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,400
the clients who came at the very end of

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,039
the week we just got really good at

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,909
apologizing to sorry you get like three

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:31,300
I don't know so that didn't work

00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,819
obviously not a great idea but to us in

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,370
the moment we thought we were doing

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:39,909
scrum okay the clients were happy we got

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,409
projects done nothing caught fire but

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,630
looking back on it it's a little bit

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,639
like your 20s where you realize that

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,779
maybe it wasn't so great and maybe you

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,130
were sitting on the floor of your house

00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,750
because he didn't have a couch and maybe

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,750
you were using a frisbee of the bowl so

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
it's time to change we now had these

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,199
three companies we were working on

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,029
improving our brand improving our team

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,830
happiness improving our client happiness

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,050
and we figured it was time to do

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,050
something so at the beginning of January

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,199
2016 as management got together and said

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,699
it's time to change so what we did is

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,979
you brought in a Superman no we brought

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,900
in a professional so someone who

00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,060
understood scrum and could explain scrum

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,909
to our teams and actually give us the

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,860
proper training to become an agile team

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:29,349
the good thing about this is is that the

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,150
management didn't just say surprise new

00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,979
thing is happening they actually said

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,419
surprise new thing is potentially

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,339
happening we're going to approach it in

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,930
a very tiny way we're going to see if it

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,250
works and if it works then we're going

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,539
to move towards it but we're not just

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,729
going to surprise you and expect you to

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,440
get it right away so what they did is

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:49,329
they found a client who was open to to

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,739
learning agile as we learned a j'l which

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,839
worked out really well it's kind of hard

00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,579
if you have a client who is very set in

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,259
their waterfall ways and wants to

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,509
continue in their waterfall ways to say

00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,149
hey we want to do training wells with

00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,069
you how does it make you feel especially

00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:06,489
the Swiss clients like teaching the

00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:10,809
Swiss clients how agile works was not a

00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:12,790
Swiss thing to do so fortunately it

00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:15,850
worked the client was happy the team

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,739
that they used was really happy and all

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,749
the teams after having seen this said

00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:21,879
okay cool we're bought in we want to be

00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:22,959
part of this new experiment with you

00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,619
let's do this

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,230
so Mike Schmidt our CTO put on his

00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:30,759
training hat and then flew to all of the

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,600
different locations and brought the good

00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:38,079
word of agile workflows to the colonies

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,389
and it worked out quite well one of the

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,239
things that was a big change is that we

00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:46,049
went from having teams by location to

00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:48,459
having teams with inner location so

00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,199
Zurich had enough people I think they

00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:52,480
had 24 at the time to actually split

00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:54,999
into two different teams previously

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,489
their stand up was 24 people standing in

00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:59,949
a circle and doing rounds which took

00:09:57,489 --> 00:10:02,410
half an hour surprise so they split that

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,929
and so each team became dedicated and

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,610
each team names themselves and each team

00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,739
became used to having their own

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,239
independent stand-ups that took

00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:15,309
obviously less than half an hour every

00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:19,089
day one of the biggest things about

00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:21,639
learning scrum that we had to digest was

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,399
that we thought we knew how things

00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,049
worked as I said before like we made

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,149
projects happen people were happy with

00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:31,329
our projects the teams were happy ish

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,649
with our projects so we just had to take

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,389
all the information that we thought we

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,079
knew about our workflow and it sorta had

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,379
to throw it away

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:41,639
and that was both refreshing and

00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,879
terrifying so when we all went in there

00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:50,619
after this new rebirth it was a bit of a

00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:52,509
baby SIPP for all of us so out of this

00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:54,429
quite a few things changed and that's

00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,249
what I want the rest of this talk to be

00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,240
about I didn't want to focus on all the

00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:00,399
negatives and I wanted to focus instead

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,139
on things that you guys could also do or

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,919
potentially learn from for your

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,919
companies as well

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,690
so some of the things that we changed is

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,270
that we restructured meetings and I'll

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,820
go over that in a bit we involve the

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,260
team in all of the things maybe to the

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,959
point where they're not so thrilled with

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,810
it but it works out for the best we

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,060
added a scrum master we enforced

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,660
story points rather than estimation by

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:33,550
hours and we really really harp on team

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,580
testing super super important and it

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,370
sounds like a lot we like these things

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,310
are new and different and it totally was

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,589
but at the end I think that it worked

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,850
out the other thing is that we kind of

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,560
played it forward we didn't just

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,440
surprise our clients and say hey this is

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,209
the new way of doing things be on board

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,430
or don't we we approached it the same

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,899
way of we're going to do this new thing

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,060
we would really like it if you were on

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:02,350
board with us are you on board with us

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,089
and they were so after we learned the

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,470
scrum ways we went to our clients and

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,750
said now it's time for you to learn the

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,000
scrum ways and they learned scrum with

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,770
us which I think worked really well had

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,180
we come to them and said surprise here's

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,899
a new way of doing things I think it

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,820
would have ended a lot differently but

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,320
in the process of doing it we didn't

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,329
just come to the clients and say hey

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,640
there's a new strange new fun thing

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,290
let's do it we shared with them like

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,880
here are some of the pain points of why

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,500
starting and stopping Sprint's on

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,209
different days are not good for you

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,540
here's why this thing is not good for

00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,310
you

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,880
here's what you'll benefit from by

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:39,700
joining us in this change and after the

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
second demo meeting I think the client

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,820
started to start to get it

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,620
we started our scrum rituals early and

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,620
we stepped to those scrum rituals since

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,140
and since implementing this existing and

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,250
new clients have all kind of helped hit

00:12:53,140 --> 00:13:00,160
that rhythm with us so one of the

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,570
biggest changes is we changed all of our

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,640
client meetings from being kind of

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,380
scattered all over the week - now all

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,600
starting and stopping are starting on

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,120
the same day so for us this day is

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,190
Tuesday so we call it demo day health

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,320
because this is the day that we're going

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,579
to be in meetings we're going to be

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,560
talking with clients we're going to be

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,080
demoing things or we'll be doing

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,310
backlog grooming so Tuesday just kind of

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,870
dedicated as you're probably not going

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,480
to get a lot of work done but make sure

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,320
that your brain is turned on that worked

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,540
the other thing that we did about this

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,640
again keeping in mind that we have two

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,640
other offices is that we synched our

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,290
scrum our sprint weeks so that we all

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,480
start and stop at the same time I

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,580
believe one of our Zurich teams starts

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,620
on Tuesday well we start on Wednesday

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,450
but for the most part our two-week

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,190
cadence is all the same time so we can

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:54,280
actually pass tickets back and forth but

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:57,340
I'll get into that also later so this is

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,690
now what our sprint week looks like it

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,450
looks like there's a lot of things on

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,660
there and there are keep in mind before

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,040
this was being done multiple times all

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,140
throughout the week because we had

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,180
multiple clients all throughout the week

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,300
that we were doing this for so now we

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,520
actually had dedicated times and clients

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,680
scheduled meetings to perform all these

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,270
things and so while it looks on paper

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,430
like it's very complicated and

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,750
time-consuming it's actually more

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,410
efficient than the way we were doing it

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,420
before so I'll just go through these

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,830
really quick so I don't have header

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,900
labels on this who I don't want like

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,450
Monday Tuesday Wednesday to influence

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,210
what you guys do it's really how your

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,400
team works best but for the sake of the

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,390
two-week sprint here's what we do so on

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,130
Wednesday morning we start this print

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,839
immediately afterwards we do ticket

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,120
planning and I'm the project manager on

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,920
the team so this means I walk away and I

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,450
leave it up to the developers to huddle

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,190
and go through the tickets and figure

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,130
out between themselves like how we're

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,020
going to approach this week to cut ahead

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,280
a little bit they're also part of the

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,660
sprint planning so they shouldn't be

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,089
surprised by the tickets that they see

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,470
so this is more of a technical like okay

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,089
if we're going to do this this and this

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,850
we need to start over here with this

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,950
ticket and this client wants to do some

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,480
kind of a launch by Friday but not on

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,700
Friday so we need to make sure that this

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,740
ticket is done a little bit earlier and

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,250
it's their way of kind of getting ahead

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:25,390
of the work before the work actually

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:27,100
snowballs the other thing is that we do

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,620
daily standup but if you notice daily

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,880
standeth is not on every day we don't do

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,209
daily standup on the same day

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,680
we do a sprint start because the dev

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,060
team sitting around talking about what

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,459
they're going to do kind of already is

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,300
that again on the Thursday following and

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,190
I'll get to that later

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,449
that's also a super busy day and so

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,060
people kind of know what they're going

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:51,910
to be doing on those days so daily

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,310
stand-up Thursday Friday and Monday and

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,380
then Tuesday is client day so we do

00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,509
backlog grooming we do not do backlog

00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,980
grooming with all of our clients we only

00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,690
do backlog grooming with clients you

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,490
have a project that's active enough to

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,410
actually meet so some clients we meet

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,880
every week some clients we meet every

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,800
other week they're cool with it we're

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,130
cool with it it's very clear about when

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,050
the meetings are going to happen on

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,449
Wednesday just like we do with Tuesday

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,940
every Wednesday is a meeting for the

00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:21,100
Sprint so the alternate Wednesday is

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,240
sprint estimation we take all those

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,610
backlogged room two ckets

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,079
we do estimation this gives us a little

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,170
bit of a barrier before we start the

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,910
next sprint to ask questions see if any

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,380
of the technology has changed make sure

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,899
we're on the same page with the client

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,839
and with the team before we start the

00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,779
next sprint another thing that we do is

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,310
on Thursday before the sprint ends we do

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,889
a board review so we pull up the board

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,139
and say is there anything on this board

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,410
that scares us or won't get finished or

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:53,130
is blocked or whatever it's a little bit

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,319
different than the daily because this is

00:16:53,130 --> 00:17:00,100
like the panic final review before the

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,660
weekend and then Tuesdays the day is

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,000
that's the last day of our sprint we

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,919
meet we do the retrospective the

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,110
retrospective we do as a team we don't

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,329
do it with the client and this is our

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,679
chance you sit down talk about the week

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,970
things that we like things that we

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,250
didn't like things we want to do better

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,770
for next time and to get those things

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,870
all laid out so the cool thing about the

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,699
way that we've implemented scrum is that

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,829
each of our teams do with the

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,600
retrospective differently so our team

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,610
takes a Google Docs because everyone can

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,799
read it at the same time we have columns

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,059
what we liked what we didn't like what

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,010
we want to change and then each person

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,200
spends five minutes just filling out

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,179
their name under their section and then

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,000
we review it we have a team in Zurich

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,059
who takes a Google drawing and they use

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,990
gifts

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:47,960
and drawn things and smiley faces on the

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,120
spectrum of smiley - frowny to indicate

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,460
how they feel and for them that's good

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,190
enough and so that's just one of those

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,690
examples of how we've all embraced scrum

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,039
but how we all kind of flavor it

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,039
differently so it works for the team

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,200
another thing that has changed is that

00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,669
everyone attends meetings so before you

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,769
had the project manager and the tech

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,779
lead attending the meetings and now on

00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,249
big projects everyone who's going to be

00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:15,080
working on that project attends the

00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:18,200
meetings and the reason that we do this

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,779
is because we were losing a lot in the

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,210
the game of telephone so tech lead and

00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,740
project manager would go they would come

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,259
back and relay the good word from the

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,990
client team would say but what about

00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:32,059
this that and the other thing and p.m.

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,200
tech we had to go back to the clients

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,330
and things would just get lost in the

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,129
middle it would take too long the team

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,779
who was implementing it didn't quite get

00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,659
invested in the project because they

00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:43,820
were just being handed tickets to do

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:46,070
which was fine but it's just it's better

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,409
overall if the client if the team can

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,289
feel like they are part of it and have

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:52,490
some choice in the matter so this is

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,460
actually helped us with a lot of things

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,899
um before when it was just me and the

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,070
tech lead meeting with the client or

00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:59,450
sometimes just me meeting with the

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,730
client and the client would ask a

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,409
question I would sit there and think hmm

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,240
should I respond to this or should I say

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,409
I have to go ask the team because I

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,779
don't really know this because I'm not a

00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:11,919
developer and that kind of pause

00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:14,360
sometimes doesn't help with building

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,710
trust with the client and so it's

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,570
actually my answer to have someone there

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,759
who's experienced with that who can

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,860
actually say yeah I know the answer to

00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,450
this or no I don't know the answer to

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,820
this but I'll go find out and let you

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,049
know constantly having to be the person

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,759
who says yeah I don't really know the

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,669
answer to that just sort of makes me

00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,129
look not efficient which i think is a

00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:35,600
good improvement because I want to be

00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,220
there to do like budgets and keeping the

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,499
team happy and all the things that the

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,799
project manager should do not be I'm

00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:44,659
going to come back to you later the

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,369
other thing is that technical ears hear

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,139
differently hear things differently the

00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:51,289
non-technical ears so I might hear from

00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:52,909
a client they want to have something

00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,870
that moves on the homepage and to me

00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,690
that means Oh

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,220
slider slideshow but to the tech team

00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,990
who might understand this differently it

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,700
might be I want to have an animation and

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,500
so having the tech team there to

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,720
actually interpret these things makes it

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,430
so that there's a lot less left on the

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,800
table another thing that we learned how

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,600
to do better remember that full of M&Ms

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,700
from before is that we learned how to

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,220
estimate as a team we learned how to

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,050
take a pile of tickets and understand

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,120
the amount of work that we expect to go

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,190
into them and then also how much of

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,530
those tickets were able to deliver at

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,450
the end of the Sprint so this actually

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,220
helps us continue to build trust with

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,179
the client because we would say hey

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,679
we're going to get these four tickets

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,360
done for you because they're X many

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,650
points and then at the end of the Sprint

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,690
we're actually able to deliver them

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,850
because we're used to being able to

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:45,590
produce as many story points in a sprint

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,960
so the good thing is is that we figured

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,630
it out the hard part is is that it was

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,410
really difficult because going from you

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,120
know t-shirt sizes hours whatever and

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,010
then everybody's own interpretation of

00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,540
how long it takes to get something done

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,590
like if you ask a friend in person how

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,420
long it's going to take to do a back-end

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,030
task you're going to get a little bit of

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,010
a mismatch but over time and after doing

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,860
a lot of estimation as a group we've all

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,860
sort of hit the rhythm and as we do that

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,559
it becomes sort of a game like how many

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,200
times can we all hit the same number

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,900
during story story poker at the same

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,309
time so we've turned that from something

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,880
kind of painful into something kind of

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:28,760
fun so one of the ways that we learned

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,890
how to estimate together is that we what

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,110
we call estimating in Anna's so if you

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:36,620
look at the amazing labs website you can

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,900
see that there is a person page for each

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,580
of the employees so each of the person

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,900
pages looks like this person sitting on

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,420
the couch and then a description about

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,190
them below the way that we started our

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,270
estimation was to say how long do you

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,660
think it's going to take to implement

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:52,070
this and at the beginning when we were

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,640
learning how to estimate we were not

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,010
fast

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,690
so these estimation meetings properly

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,920
we're about two hours until we kind of

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,320
got the hang of it and now they're

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,679
closer to half an hour an hour but that

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,150
first month or so was pretty painful so

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,640
the way that we figured this out was to

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,990
was to

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,060
figure out what it was that we needed to

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,370
do on this page and all the different

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,380
elements that went into it so it wasn't

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,110
just how do we do this we were actually

00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,640
talking out how to write the acceptance

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,830
criteria for a ticket at the same time

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,790
so if you're looking at this you've got

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,500
a hero image you've got an h1 ignore the

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,140
top thing because the header is already

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,310
part of the website and so we started to

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,680
learn to talk to the different elements

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,120
on a page and not just say give me this

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,740
thing I'm going to take it and then when

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,170
I'm done building I'll throw it over to

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,690
the front-end person now we look at it

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,280
as in order to do this we need to be

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,020
able to do all these things have it

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,100
tested and out the door by the end of

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,740
the sprint so it's a little bit

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,660
different way of looking at how you

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:56,410
would approach new work another thing

00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,500
that changed is that we took on writing

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,480
tickets but like I mentioned before we

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,450
do scrum but we kind of do scrum in our

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,300
own flavor our team decided that writing

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,550
stories user stories wasn't the best way

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,790
for us to understand and interpret

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:16,020
tickets so you know I don't you probably

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:21,340
seen the the phrasing of blank so that

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,500
blank whatever we for us that was two up

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,720
in the air and it left too much open to

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,280
be decided and at the end of the day

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,740
like the developers were like but I

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,090
don't know what to do and I'm glad that

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,740
you're giving me this freedom but I

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,190
would rather be told some more

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,820
structuring and so based on that we

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,130
structured our tickets a little bit

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,570
differently so now if you see one of our

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,780
tickets and we'll go over the tickets

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,030
later what you'll see instead is the

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,490
tasks kind of short-handed up in the

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,010
title and then acceptance criteria that

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,750
helps lay out what this is in the

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,310
acceptance criteria or above the

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,200
acceptance criteria what we'll do is

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,670
we'll try to figure out what the

00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,740
business value is what we're hoping to

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,480
accomplish and what must be part of

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,180
delivery which is essentially a user

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,180
story but written in words that we like

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,170
so a little bit about backlog grooming

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,530
that might be a little bit different

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:17,290
than how you guys implement scrum is

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,580
anyone can make tickets and I present

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,310
when I presented this before at Bad camp

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,680
there was like shock and awe

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,050
happening in the in the crowd the reason

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,910
that we do this is because if you're a

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,670
developer in there and something breaks

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,380
or you notice a thing and you want to

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,420
flag it you might be able to articulate

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,250
that thing better than coming back to me

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,260
and saying hey Steph this thing happened

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,310
now I need you to make it be not

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,780
technical go do that so now if a

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,070
developer find something they'll make a

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,480
ticket they say hey Steph I made a

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,190
ticket and I'll be like great cool let's

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,200
add it to the backlog we can figure out

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,300
if it's an on fire ticket or if it's a

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,100
great to have ticket or if it's just a

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,110
ticket that if we don't end up fixing by

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,540
the end of the story or by the end of

00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,420
the Sprint or by the end of launch we as

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,650
a team will feel to feel like we failed

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,430
so it's just a nice way of being able to

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:07,680
bubble up problems or tasks in real time

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:12,270
rather than having to create like a

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,680
parking lot lot task list at the end the

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,960
other thing that we learn to do is clear

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,940
acceptance criteria so even if a client

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,890
writes the ticket it doesn't mean that

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,990
the team cannot go in and edit the

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,300
ticket what we try to do in that

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,010
situation is to make a comment that says

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,210
hey I'm changing this acceptance

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,620
criteria because the way that you've

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,000
written it makes it sound like we should

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,440
launch on the moon but I don't think

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,520
that's really what you meant so we're

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,970
going to change it to something that we

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,080
think is a little more realistic the

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,390
other thing that we do is a shared

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,130
definition of done we went through the

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,790
exercise of figuring out what those

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,680
Dunn's were and we're happy to realize

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,050
that those are not going to be things

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,030
that can last on every ticket it just it

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,950
becomes too burdensome and heavy to have

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,020
it be part of every ticket so some

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,250
examples of definitions of done items

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,840
are browser testing functional testing

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,900
tech review testing code review testing

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,790
you're not going to do a code review on

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,530
a design so it's a little bit

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,990
unnecessary to have all of those things

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,540
apply to all tickets all the time so

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,430
when we do ticket testing or we do a

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,210
ticket we make sure to kind of outline

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,800
what those those Dunn's are going to be

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,740
but as we go through the process of

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,450
doing tickets week after week we get a

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,070
shared vocabulary of what kinds of

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,290
things we know are going to be expected

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,090
out of a ticket so for example if we

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,250
have a design ticket that design never

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,570
sees the client until the tech team is

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,169
seen it because we don't want to say

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,179
here cly

00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:37,739
it hears this pretty thing and then

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,029
after the client of yeah I totally want

00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:41,179
that thing the text team goes yeah

00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:43,139
there's no way that's going to happen

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,330
we're we're getting a lot better at

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:47,129
communicating early and being able to

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,480
present things that the team is already

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:51,299
comfortable with so that the client

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,929
doesn't get shiny things taken away from

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:59,100
them the other thing is that we've

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:02,489
enforced the freedom to split split

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,679
tickets so for example back to that Anna

00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:08,450
example if we find out that the Anna

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,809
picture needs to rotate into a different

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,519
picture

00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:12,899
halfway through someone being on that

00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,359
page or some kind of thing it's not

00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,950
really clear when you look at it we have

00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,859
the ability to say okay we're going to

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,619
deliver that piece with Anna as the

00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:24,119
header but the animation will come in a

00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,169
second ticket so being able to go

00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,389
through and split the tickets so that

00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:30,210
it's more manageable and can still

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:33,200
deliver something usable but that still

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,220
identifies there's more to be done later

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,379
the other thing is reinforcing

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,359
prioritizing and it's not just for the

00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:40,950
clients that we do this it's also for

00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,720
the team because our team loves making

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,119
shiny pretty beautiful things and

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,830
sometimes we see a thing and it makes us

00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,119
sad in our heart to not be able to focus

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,399
all of our attention on it immediately

00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,669
because other things need to happen and

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,399
so again creating tickets allows us to

00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:59,039
say I realized that this font is not the

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,100
ideal font maybe if there's time at the

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,389
end of the project we can just get that

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,529
done and maybe we'll just eat the cost

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:06,299
of getting it done because it's not

00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:10,950
broken a client thinks it's great I

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:13,440
don't think it's great so now that we've

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,789
talked about some processes with with

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,919
clients and with the teams I'm going to

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:18,720
get into some of the juicy technicals

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,159
and this is probably where you're going

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,019
to be said about not being able to see

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,389
clearly some of the examples apologies

00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,879
in advance for those of you who don't

00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,960
have JIRA

00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:30,869
maybe pull out your phones for a few

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,429
minutes for those of you who do I'll be

00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:36,749
able to show you what the guts of this

00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:40,950
look like afterwards if you'd like so

00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:44,009
this is our backlog hello and I'm just

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,570
going to kind of go over how some of it

00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,950
works this obviously isn't the whole

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:51,310
thing but this is a digestible part

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,450
of our backlog so it's broken up into

00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,780
three sections

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,600
the current sprint the upcoming sprint

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,240
and the backlog so the current sprints

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,070
as I mentioned we have four different

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,990
teams in a mazy labs kind of all over

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:08,260
the world each team has named themselves

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:11,950
our Austin team and scrum and Koch which

00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:15,220
yes we think is super clever and this is

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,650
as you'll notice multiple projects being

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,440
listed in here so one of the big changes

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,660
that we made was to take all of our

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,500
client boards and merge them into one

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,270
mega board we're very excited about on

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,390
this you can see a couple things that

00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,220
are useful you'll see there's epics

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,380
listed there's people assigned to

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,820
tickets there's story points there's a

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,890
priority in there even though you can't

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,790
tell that there's a priority in there of

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:45,400
things that need to get done and then

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,500
you have the upcoming sprint so we

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,670
handle this upcoming sprint probably a

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,080
little bit differently than some of you

00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,600
would I know that

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,720
scrum tells us that we should be in real

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,310
time like doing all the things we're

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,320
still people and we are still a little

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,090
bit OCD and so we'd like to know kind of

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,770
what's coming up next friend and so

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,660
depending on the project we might

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,760
actually have one or two upcoming

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,130
Sprint's listed out just to help us keep

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,350
track of the tickets in the order that

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,470
they come in so what you're seeing here

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,450
is once the Sprint is done in theory

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,730
we're going to tackle this next sprint

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,310
in this order and this is a sort of help

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,960
keeps track of stuff this doesn't mean

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,420
that what's happening out here will

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,910
happen what what sometimes happens is

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:32,290
that maybe green 59 will end up in the

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,720
prioritize for sprints multiple times

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,400
until we get tired of seeing it and then

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,170
go send it to backlog land where it will

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,910
live forever until the project is over

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,320
and then we look back on it and say hey

00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,510
remember that one time but that one

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:48,370
ticket was there we don't think it was

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:50,050
so important yep so another thing about

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,450
this is that we try to implement

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,190
priorities with the client but there

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,320
comes times when the priority won't be

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,820
able to be implemented because for

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,950
example if the client would like there

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,000
to be a tire first and we need to make

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,960
sure that there's an engine actually

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,629
because for

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,860
the engine's going to be more critical

00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:08,470
we'll take the priority and actually

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,389
change it up the priority with a client

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,619
really comes into play when we are

00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:14,289
discussing do you want it to happen in

00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:16,389
this sprint or next sprint once it's in

00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:23,309
the sprint we sort of take control of

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:26,710
the tickets themselves again the backlog

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:29,619
yeah another cool thing about this is

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,690
again we've got four different scrum

00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:34,299
groups going on it at any given time and

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,610
so we have this cool quick tabs across

00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,259
the top and so depending on which

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,240
project that you're working on you can

00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:43,570
just click on the quick tab it'll just

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,830
show those tickets but if you're in a

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,159
different project team

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,470
I don't want every other project to show

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,730
on my hoard because that would make

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,529
everyone super super sad

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,869
so instead we've implemented this thing

00:31:53,529 --> 00:32:00,549
called ligament we've implemented labels

00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:03,730
and added that to our JIRA search string

00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:06,129
and so now if there are X's hey I want

00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,980
you to work on this project all day to

00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:11,259
do is add a TX to their ticket and it

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,940
will show in our backlog so it makes it

00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:15,090
really really easy to pass tickets

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,350
between the teams without overburdening

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,970
each of the teams with all of the

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,330
projects that exist in the amazing

00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:24,369
ecosphere another thing on here is that

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,200
you'll notice is so obviously I look

00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,269
hidden the client names and with change

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,990
them out with colors but the ones I

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:34,269
haven't changed are actual internal

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,700
projects so one of the things that we do

00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,970
to sort of envelope scrum into all the

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,159
things that we do is we incorporate

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,559
internal stuff group-wide stuff and

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,909
client stuff so on this board you're

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,749
actually seeing internal work

00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:53,379
I think DrupalCon and a client work and

00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:58,509
Zurich work so it should be a board of

00:32:53,379 --> 00:33:02,440
doom but it's actually quite nice one

00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:05,259
thing also to mention is in the scrum in

00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,240
the sprint we of course take in tickets

00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:09,359
we think we're going to tackle but

00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,580
sometimes things happen mid sprint so

00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,980
the client will turn their website off

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,780
or I don't know but depending

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,140
on what the issue is from my clients

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,400
will take that make it into a ticket and

00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,690
I'll check with a developer and say hey

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,049
you got three seconds I need you to look

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:28,179
at this ticket this thing happened do we

00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,860
think that it's critical or do we think

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:31,780
that it's a super easy fix and depending

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,049
on the critical nexus the criticalness

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,809
or the easiness of fixing it will will

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:39,100
sometimes take in smaller tickets or

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,870
super critical tickets into the sprint

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,250
but for the most part we've gotten

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,110
pretty good with our clients saying is

00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,030
this broken and and will you die if we

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,490
don't fix it or is it broken and can you

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,070
wait until next sprint to incorporate it

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,400
into next week sprint for the most part

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,840
they're pretty cool with them alright so

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,730
that was JIRA I blew through jura pretty

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,780
quickly but I'll mention a couple other

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:05,140
things I believe later on retrospective

00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,480
so this is one of the things in the

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,330
relearning of how to scrum that I think

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,220
the team struggled with the most at

00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,600
first we were like I don't really get it

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,480
we're obviously talking to each other

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,220
every day at the daily stand-ups like we

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,530
all kind of are aware of what's going on

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,990
right surprise when we actually sharted

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,690
doing the retrospective and being honest

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,730
in the retrospective we realized oh

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,619
these are useful let's continue doing

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,310
them so I'm going to share a little bit

00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,330
of our learning from the retrospective

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,850
the first thing that we learned is that

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,919
the retrospective is not a fiction

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,629
what we have an hour dedicated for the

00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,700
team to talk about how that week was if

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,340
the entire time is dedicated to just

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,169
moaning then everyone will feel like it

00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,369
was a waste of time and feel like very

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,399
negatively towards doing the

00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:53,889
retrospective and so by enforcing those

00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,869
three columns of what did we like what

00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,910
did we not like and how can we fix it

00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:59,859
that actually forces us to say yeah this

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,850
thing really really sucked and here's

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:02,320
how we're going to do better next time

00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,330
and so going through the process of

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,100
actually verbalizing these things have

00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,580
actually helped the team feel like

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:12,340
they're actually beneficial so just kind

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,300
of embracing that as a useful thing has

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,310
helped change our mindset about

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,900
retrospective the other things that

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,230
we've learned out of retrospective is

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,869
things like a when you have a ticket and

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,890
you are done with that ticket you put it

00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,720
into testing

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,910
and previously when tickets went into

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,309
testing it kind of went there to die and

00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,710
that was really lame because you would

00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:37,240
get to the end of the sprint and no one

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,220
had bothered testing any of the tickets

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,410
and suddenly it's Friday and everyone

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,170
realizes that they have a day to test

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,670
and fix anything in the tickets and that

00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,049
ends up stressing everybody out and

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,940
everyone felt like it was maybe someone

00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:51,400
else's fault or maybe the PM's fault for

00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,849
not testing everything and so realizing

00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,549
that testing was important early and

00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,309
often we we embrace the mindset of

00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:03,970
treating tickets like a hot potato

00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:04,839
that's a potato so in the morning during

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,640
daily stand-ups

00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,829
someone need to mention hey this thing

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,950
went into testing yesterday can someone

00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:13,779
test it or we use slack to say hey this

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,809
one's ready for testing someone go and

00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:19,240
grab it and we have now a process of as

00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,519
soon as a deaf person is done touching a

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,140
deaf ticket a deaf person will pick up

00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,309
that ticket and then test it and then

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,410
depending on whether or not we need

00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:28,240
design work then our designer will go

00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,799
and pick it up and then once that's all

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,259
done I will pick it up and try to break

00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:34,000
it so getting that done early and often

00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:35,619
and then sending it to me

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,460
saves everyone the heartache of having

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:42,190
me break it early but late another thing

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,440
is that story points are going to mean

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,759
different things to different people we

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,220
were mentioned to our client who does

00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:53,200
scrum that a thirteen by Thursday is is

00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,220
one of the goals that we have and he

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,750
looked at me and said there's no way

00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,829
that we could do a thirteen in a single

00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,569
sprint so

00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,849
thirteen obviously means different

00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:03,519
things to different people but for us a

00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:05,170
thirteen would be a pretty big

00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,680
implementation that we could get done

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,690
during a single two-week period for us

00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,299
when we do that Thursday board review if

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,519
that thirteen is not in testing by the

00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:18,009
end of the day we have failed so that's

00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,019
one of our goals get that 13 out the

00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:22,029
door so that we can test it and find all

00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:27,099
the bugs associated with it and get that

00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:29,170
ready for client demo the other thing is

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,430
testing so I'm going to repeat this

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,309
again because we learned the hard way

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,480
test all your things of course we're

00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:36,369
going to miss stuff because that's just

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,490
what happens when there's all moving

00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:40,570
parts of a website but if you test you

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,690
shouldn't be too

00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,040
prized by really big things so some of

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,990
the things that we've implemented is

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,490
code review surprisingly we didn't

00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,990
always do code review at the beginning

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,970
sometimes we would do code review at the

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,970
very end of a project and then you would

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:57,010
be surprised instead we would now do

00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,180
white box testing which means Stephanie

00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,220
goes in there knowing what it's going to

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,550
what the functionality should be and

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,770
then try to break it which is fun

00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,510
including deployment instructions which

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,250
seems like a you should totally have

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,040
that was actually not something that we

00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,930
had written down as a you must have so

00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,960
now all testing includes deployment

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,160
instructions and testing instructions if

00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,650
the thing that you're testing isn't

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,630
super clear and then also browser

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,940
testing defining what the browsers and

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,920
the mobile devices are in the ticket

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,260
because not every client has the same

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,520
requirements so making sure that we have

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:37,840
those queued up to go always part of it

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,790
just a quick view of our JIRA board this

00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,170
is what I talked about again so if in

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,380
the middle of you see that we've got

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,330
internal and internal testing and review

00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,190
so again like a design ticket you would

00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,380
really test the design ticket but you

00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,690
would review a ticket and with the

00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,910
client depending on the client not all

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,460
of our clients are technical and so that

00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,870
that column just becomes demo because

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,550
not all of them are going to go in and

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,350
do actual client testing we do have

00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,770
clients who love to do testing and so

00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,670
they kind of go into that same column so

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,980
internal things that we haven't started

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,780
yet in progress things that we're

00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,320
working on actively and what you'll see

00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,970
in here is that there's no two phases

00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,570
no one's face is on two tickets to well

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,430
in progress

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,960
unless you have like two laptops open

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,340
and you're actively doing something it's

00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,800
impossible for you to do two things at

00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,870
once in theory so we try to encourage

00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,510
someone to not have their face on two

00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,670
tickets in in progress and that also

00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,340
helps it so that if something needs to

00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,050
get done like keep it on the to do side

00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,910
and leave it blank so that if someone

00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,070
finishes their work on another ticket

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,690
they can go grab that otherwise if you

00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,680
have your face on two things like people

00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,350
are going to think that they're being

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,480
taken care of and it in actuality like

00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,100
ticket B might not be touched at all so

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,000
that sort of helps kind of keep

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:54,220
everything together

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,150
and then one of the things that we do

00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,740
but I'm not really going to go in here

00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,380
is that we try to keep deployments out

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,730
of the same sprint that the work is

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,710
being done unless we've communicated

00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,480
directly with a client and said hey this

00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,730
ticket must be deployed as part of this

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,200
sprint we try to keep them separate so

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,349
what we'll do at the end of a sprint is

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,050
we'll it'll go through the emotions of

00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:18,490
going through client client testing and

00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:19,930
then after the demo is over we'll create

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,520
a new ticket that says deploy does

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,500
ticket and depending on how many tickets

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,570
that we have for that project it'll say

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,460
deployment for Sprint whatever the

00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,960
Sprint is and then it'll list all the

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,480
tickets for that project that are

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,890
associated with the upcoming sprint so

00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,680
this way it makes it so that the client

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,940
has time between the demo and the

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,220
deployment to actually do some heavy

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,260
testing and so that we're not rushing it

00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,790
like Tuesday at 2 o'clock to like to

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,680
play all the things really quickly and

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,570
hope nothing breaks so it just sort of

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,040
helps me tear out the work and it meters

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,810
it out so that the clients not on fire

00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,119
and that the teams aren't on fire and

00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:58,390
it's actually helped us get a better

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,740
control on deployments in general so

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,540
along with this team communication

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,950
changed I didn't think it was going to

00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,599
without our communication was actually

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,680
going pretty well but the things that

00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,790
were going to go over some of the things

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,099
that were surprises to me so one of the

00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:15,580
things is that now that we're in a more

00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:18,099
all ticket all the time mentality slack

00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,800
actually became a great way of passing

00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,750
those tickets to each other so our

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,820
DevOps people that B have actually

00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,099
integrated JIRA with slack and so if you

00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,830
mention a ticket in slack the ticket

00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:31,410
will appear in slack and it's really

00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,119
easy to say like hey I'm looking at

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,369
yellow 50 to please go take a look at

00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:38,890
this and then the team uses that to just

00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:40,480
pass tickets back and forth or say hey I

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,080
have a question about this ticket what

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,750
do I do

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,609
and that way like email becomes a place

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,720
of real business and not just a place

00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:51,130
where information goes to buy another

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,960
thing that we do is at each of our slack

00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,599
each of our projects has its own

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,450
dedicated slack channel but depending on

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,070
the clients our clients sometimes would

00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:02,140
love to be in slack and so they are in

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,820
slack with us in that channel actively

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,470
going through tickets with us and

00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,930
responding to questions

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,400
or they're in slack and maybe we don't

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,900
feel comfortable having some of the

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,180
conversations about the project with the

00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,890
client there and so we've got to and we

00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,400
just label that our deployment ones so

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:19,210
in all ways we're still allowed to have

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,530
communication with the team and we're

00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,930
still allowed to have communication with

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,359
a client but we build ourselves like

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:29,579
safety barriers so that everyone is

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:33,190
comfortable with what's going on and

00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:35,530
let's see the other thing that we got

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:39,310
really good at is making comments and

00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:40,300
again this feels like a duh but one of

00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,460
the things that we would go through is

00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,190
is that a dev would pass a ticket to a

00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,500
dev and maybe in slack they would say a

00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,520
good job looks great but in the ticket

00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,589
there would be no history of any

00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,569
communication at all so you would go

00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:54,310
from having a ticket being worked on and

00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,810
maybe some deployment instructions and

00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,550
then suddenly I would come in and be

00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,230
like browser test zoom and there would

00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,660
be no history of anything that happened

00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:05,079
between started like point A and point B

00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,520
so that was problematic for a variety of

00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,500
reasons for example if you close a

00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,140
ticket and two months later have to go

00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,700
back and look at that ticket you go oh I

00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,290
guess this magically happened and

00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,020
everyone was super happy about it except

00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:18,490
for it broke so now we're super good

00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,160
about going in and saying I have a

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,349
question I want you to review this I

00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,619
need some feedback and then documenting

00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:28,359
that even if we have a meeting to talk

00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:31,060
about something someone is responsible

00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:33,190
for taking the notes or the outcome of

00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,670
that meeting and documenting it that way

00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:38,500
it lives here as a result we also use

00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,839
confluence but as a result of getting

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,000
better at using the comments we've

00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,970
stopped putting so much in confluence

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
that's real-time and using it more for

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,980
just client meetings and like a dev

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,740
environment information look so it's

00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:58,150
very static and you're on the other hand

00:43:53,740 --> 00:44:02,349
is very vibrant another thing that we've

00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:05,380
implemented is more meetings but in a

00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:07,480
good way so now meetings don't suck it's

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,180
not always me as project manager calling

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,470
the meetings if one of our devs have a

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,240
question that we either pull in all the

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,339
other devs or they'll grab the designer

00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,460
although grab me or we'll grab the

00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:18,789
clients and do an ad hoc meeting and we

00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,009
actually

00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,449
encourage these now and people actively

00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:24,039
do them on their own because now they

00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:25,869
feel more in control of what's actually

00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,569
being discussed and they're not just

00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:32,319
sitting in a two hour meeting trying

00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:34,769
really hard not to touch Facebook the

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,640
result of this is that devs are happier

00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:37,959
clients are happier because they feel

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,369
like they're more involved we're not

00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,929
just sending them two times a week and

00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:42,999
then just being like you're surprised

00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:44,499
here's the thing that we made they feel

00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:48,880
like they're more actively engaged in

00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:51,099
what's being what's being billed another

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,529
thing is that because we are a remote

00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:55,959
team and the team Austin also works from

00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:57,579
home on Fridays and everything that we

00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,900
do has to be treated as though you're

00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:01,239
not going to see the person that you're

00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,269
talking to in real life so we've gotten

00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:07,869
better at doing remote collaboration and

00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:09,279
this can mean a variety of thing so one

00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:10,900
if you're going to have a slack

00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:13,539
discussion and the slack discussion is

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,789
going to become a book call that person

00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,289
because like everyone's super refined

00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:18,759
with like typing a book but the other

00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:21,249
person maybe doesn't like reading the

00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:24,279
book and things get lost in just text

00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:26,049
bars so get on a flat call we have zoom

00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:27,429
integrated into slack I feel like I'm

00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:29,799
pitching a bunch of products but it

00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:31,119
keeps us integrated to have all of these

00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:34,150
different tools kind of talking together

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,219
so I ping one of my devs I say I've got

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,109
a question this thing looks like oh wait

00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:40,359
hold on let's have a call I'll do slash

00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:42,009
zoom start the call five seconds later

00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:43,989
we both know what's happening and we

00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:52,179
both can walk away like knowing that the

00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:54,579
ticket is under control one of the other

00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:57,549
things that we have as a p.m. have

00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:59,529
gotten really a lot better at is stop

00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:01,179
emailing your clients which sounds kind

00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:02,949
of funny pick up the phone if there's a

00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:04,359
problem pick up the phone if you need

00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,849
something right away and maybe your

00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,529
client is prone to travel or you know

00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:11,499
they get a lot of email in their inbox

00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:13,119
because even though you as a team are

00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:15,759
involved in the project all the time

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,259
your client isn't part of your team in

00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:18,789
the fact that they they have their own

00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:20,289
business happening they've got their own

00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,459
people they're reporting - and they've

00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:21,909
got their own things they have to do

00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,979
every day

00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:26,679
they're not in the project all the time

00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:27,819
most of the time so for you to think

00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:29,919
that they're going to be available all

00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,710
the time is just not realistic so give

00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:33,740
them a call

00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:35,210
get on a zoom with them put a meeting on

00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,580
their calendar if you know that they're

00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,490
super busy but just constantly have

00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,840
communication open with your client if

00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,640
they're in slack and they're active

00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,710
great this maybe doesn't apply but if

00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,860
they're clients who maybe need a little

00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:50,090
bit more coaxing or are more likely to

00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,430
say yeah just go figure it out like

00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,920
whatever get them on a phone call it's a

00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,180
lot easier it's a lot harder for them to

00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,800
not answer the phone or to not answer

00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:02,480
your question if you do that so now

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,920
we're getting into the fun stuff and

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,270
again I can talk about this offline

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,700
because it's a little bit difficult to

00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,670
take like a 40 page document and put it

00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,920
on the screen side but we also started

00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,600
in talking about scrum with clients

00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,320
going into new projects so we didn't

00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,450
wanted to surprise them by by sending

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,250
out proposals in a waterfall way and

00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:25,340
then when the project kicked off be like

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:27,770
surprise scrum so now we have it in our

00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:30,080
proposals of how we do things we include

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:33,680
our project management approach we

00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,240
include we include estimations and we

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,730
enforce almost to the point of being

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,080
annoying this is an estimation here's a

00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,360
definition of an estimation

00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,280
it totally is not a promise we're not

00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,670
going to get you 75 things for X number

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,250
of monies because things change and we

00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,680
reread it we reiterated in different

00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,960
ways so that it's not just if you change

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,750
a thing I will charge you more we try to

00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,660
make it clear so that projects are a

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,430
living thing if you change this it might

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,900
not make the budget change but we might

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,430
need to get some things off the table in

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,430
order to deliver by the time that you

00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,840
need it so reinforcing the same idea but

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:11,210
in different ways throughout the

00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,010
proposal just reinforces over and over

00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,960
again that scrum is not just one part of

00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,470
how we do it it's the entire how we do

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,030
it the other thing that we do is we

00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,570
outline specifically that the client

00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:25,370
will pay for scrum rituals and

00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,170
surprisingly people who are new to

00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,700
amazing are pretty cool with that like

00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,620
if we're clear which is one of the

00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,450
things that we try to do in all

00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,400
communications with clients if we're

00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,560
transparent and say here's going to be a

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,210
thing that we do they're cool with it if

00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,560
we surprise them with the invoice and

00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:43,030
say here's a line item that we didn't

00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,030
talk about then they get said

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,860
um who pays first groan so you saw our

00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,900
JIRA board before and I mentioned that

00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,400
there were not just client things on the

00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:57,200
board because of it it's not just client

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,580
to pay for scrum we acknowledge that

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,440
we're going to have other things going

00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,360
on and so it doesn't make sense for the

00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,330
clients to bear the burden of us doing

00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,640
all of our scrum rituals so this is a

00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:10,880
quick and dirty example at the end of

00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,980
every month we do a scrum report as you

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,650
can see there's three scrum or sorry

00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,180
three sprints listed at the top

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,490
depending on the month sometimes a

00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,400
sprint will fall kind of between a month

00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,630
so we have to fake it a little bit my

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,930
favorite months are the ones where the

00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,490
two sprint cycles land perfectly between

00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:32,660
the 1st and the 31st doesn't matter what

00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:35,090
happens but what this is is it's mass it

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,970
hopefully doesn't have a typo in there

00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,800
but what it is is we take all the story

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,900
points that were completed during the

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,730
sprint we don't count ones that were

00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,550
started or in progress or anything like

00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,400
that this is only completed tickets we

00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:51,260
calculate them so team ticket pink had

00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,830
12 story points over the course of these

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:57,710
three sprints in the number of things

00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,930
that was 2% of the sprint so they're

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:03,860
going to carry 2% of the burden of our

00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:06,860
logged hours to these events so if you

00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:08,990
go back a couple of slides we had a

00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,520
daily stand up we had sprint planning we

00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:13,190
had sprint estimation we have sprint

00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,380
retrospective all of these things but

00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,690
the entire team build against so in JIRA

00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,730
will log spend an hour in scrum

00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,500
estimation set 10 minutes and daily

00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:25,000
stand up all of these hours are logged

00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,050
and they go towards the calculation so

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,760
one of the things they didn't show here

00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:31,280
was just a count so like in a typical

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,500
sprint we might do typical month we

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,800
might do between 30 and 40 hours in

00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,360
scrum rituals which is a lot and again

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,530
it's also a lot to put on just clients

00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:45,410
so this number will say ok you had 47

00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:46,790
hours logged to these scrum rituals now

00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,490
let's see how much is actually available

00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:51,380
and so in the adjusted column what I'll

00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,820
do is I'll take out all the internal

00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,860
work so I'm not going to obviously

00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,300
charge myself for them but I will just

00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,590
remove it so that

00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,960
only the things that we're actually

00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:04,160
going to pass on to the clients show in

00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,820
the calculation so for this one team

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,850
yellow

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:11,180
they had three point five six hours of

00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,680
time and that shows in the work log that

00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:16,280
your work log that I pull for all my

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,510
clients as SMC strategy and planning we

00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,180
don't write out scrum and code because

00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,860
not everyone thinks it's funny but

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:27,950
that's how it looks they'll see it as a

00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:30,860
line item in their work log all right so

00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:31,850
my takeaways these are just hopefully

00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,880
recaps the things that we already

00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:37,010
mentioned the team as a whole is way

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,830
more efficient a quick plug for a maze I

00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,690
owe getting client getting the team on

00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,180
to new projects is super easy it used to

00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,620
take half a day to get a developer on

00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,600
board onto a project just from a

00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,540
technical perspective now takes an hour

00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,340
so that really helps clear communication

00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,530
and clear expectations both for the team

00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,450
and for the client makes everyone a lot

00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,520
happier you go in knowing what's

00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:01,700
expected you come out hopefully on the

00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,990
same page of marching orders we have

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,520
better testing which means the client

00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,960
gets a better product and it means at

00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,400
the end of the day we feel much more

00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,710
pride in the products that we're

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,990
delivering a team is really confident

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,330
the clients really happy and the team is

00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:15,500
super invested in the final project one

00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:18,650
of the thing they didn't put in here was

00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,930
the team launches so every time we do a

00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,370
website launch the team kind of throws a

00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,210
little party because for us it's a

00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,830
really big deal

00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,720
we spent a bunch of time building this

00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:31,400
thing we're really excited about it and

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:34,580
so we're going to celebrate so now the

00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,860
all of the amazing are on the same scrum

00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,710
cycle we're all doing scrum properly now

00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:41,450
instead of our own broken variations of

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,890
it and we're all really happy with the

00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,440
variations that we're using they're all

00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,890
working we can pass tickets between each

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,120
other and communication and

00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:54,850
relationships with all the other offices

00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:57,410
have actually improved and in conclusion

00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:59,630
everyone's super happy we all live

00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,660
happily ever after does anybody have any

00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,660
questions

00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:13,360
cool I think there's a mic if you want

00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:20,320
to go to the mic so they can record what

00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:22,120
the question is going to be hi you

00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,920
alluded in passing and then moved on

00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,530
about how is really hard and painful to

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,710
convert the teens to story points yep

00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,360
and I don't know if you can expand on

00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,610
that a little bit because on our team

00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,900
and what I'm getting from the devs that

00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,980
like they don't really see I use in that

00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,690
and they're like I don't understand

00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,620
story points I just know how long I

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,270
think it's going to take me to do

00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:44,200
something so how did you kind of work

00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:46,480
through that so one of the hard things

00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,160
for us is that our team is really small

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,220
we're three developers one designer in

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,050
me and so to have me sit there and maybe

00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,490
give a story point estimate for how long

00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,430
it's going to take to build a skyscraper

00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:59,140
isn't maybe the most efficient but what

00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:01,420
it does is it kind of gives you a shared

00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:03,490
language so that when things come

00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,920
through you all start to grow a shared

00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:10,150
understanding of how much time certain

00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:13,270
things take to do we do acknowledge that

00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,980
ours do play a part in story points but

00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,290
we also acknowledge that it's not just

00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,280
the getting those people in the room or

00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,750
getting that person in the room to

00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,640
actually deliver the product sometimes

00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,710
it's a matter of how many different

00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,330
pieces or you need to pull in order to

00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,800
get this done or we can be able to do

00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:28,360
this all internally are we gonna have to

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,640
go find someone else do we need to have

00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,040
a third vendor come in and do something

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,500
and just having those discussions of

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,300
what's what we think the ticket means is

00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:41,860
helpful that answer the question okay

00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,420
well just in case it didn't no I just

00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:48,220
want to drill down more into that same

00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,990
question as it were and so there's

00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:54,040
always this tension in scrum where it's

00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:56,760
like this ideal world of agile is where

00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:01,180
we just push business objectives into

00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,010
work and then let the developers figure

00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,990
out the implementation right we're

00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:08,170
trying to get away from telling the

00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:10,660
developers to say do this so that they

00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,950
just do it and it's done and then later

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,590
the client says well it's actually

00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,940
broken and the developers say well you

00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,730
this is what you told us to do right

00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,760
we're trying to get away

00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:22,760
from that right and so we want to leave

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,260
that stuff open but but then you have

00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,750
the other tension of saying we actually

00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,950
want to get the stuff done right so we

00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,720
want to know what it is we're doing

00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,210
before we go into work right so there's

00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,640
this kind of conflicting yes goals and

00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:37,310
estimating is kind of the ground where

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:41,480
all that kind of the tension actually

00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:44,240
comes out so is if you're estimating

00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,680
hours for the purpose of like saying how

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,920
long is this actually going to get done

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,020
or so really the question is can you

00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:55,520
really talk into this question of what

00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,770
you are trying to get done when you are

00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:01,280
going through the process particularly

00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:03,620
like in in backlog refinement especially

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,790
but then also in sprint planning in your

00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,290
mind what are you actually trying to

00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:08,600
accomplish when you're talking about

00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:10,040
estimates what we're trying to really do

00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,950
is figure out how complicated something

00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,990
is because if we identify all the moving

00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,630
parts of delivering a ticket and we

00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:20,300
realize that we don't know how to do a

00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,770
ticket will estimate an extra-high so if

00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,940
we're handed a ticket says I'm on a

00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,050
ferris wheel and we're like well I think

00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,580
I know what a ferris wheel is and I

00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,110
think I saw something on drupal.org that

00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,990
might be a module for a ferris wheel I

00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:32,030
need to go look at it will estimate that

00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,650
ticket high and at the end if we're

00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,880
wrong and it's actually a three because

00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:37,010
the module did all the things we wanted

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,400
it to then we'll change that story point

00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:43,160
from a like a 13 to a three and and it's

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,050
just a matter of having the

00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,400
understanding that we can be wrong when

00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:49,400
we're doing story points really helps

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,290
for the most part the ones we're in the

00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,630
project we have a better rhythm of

00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:55,490
getting the story points right but

00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:57,710
usually it takes a month maybe a two

00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:59,180
full cycles of a sprint to realize yeah

00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,650
we've got a handle on the project we

00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:05,390
understand what the client says when

00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:07,730
they say X&Y but for each each each

00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,830
client is different and I actually do a

00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:12,710
report where I pull all the hours worked

00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:14,690
in a sprint against all of the hours all

00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:16,880
the story points estimated on a project

00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:18,920
and come up with an average of how many

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,110
hours it takes to do that

00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,670
those those deliverables and for the

00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,200
most part like if we have a project

00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,240
that's existed and we kind of figured

00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,070
out and know how it goes like a story

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,720
point per hour ratio will be like an

00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,369
hour maybe and a new

00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,260
projects will be somewhere closer to

00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:35,359
like 2.7 so there's definitely a range

00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,450
but we do try to stay away from ours

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,520
because then the then the developer

00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:42,109
feels beholden to that hour so like if

00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,910
they say oh we can take 4 hours but they

00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:45,500
can't do 4 hours because something

00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,359
exploded or they just didn't understand

00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,490
then they feel really guilty if they're

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,010
not able to deliver under 4 hours and so

00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,810
we do that to help keep the developer

00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,240
from feeling that guilt and also did

00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,800
Yoona Kate like I don't know how to do

00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,330
this it's super complicated or I know

00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:04,280
how to do this and it will be super

00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:07,490
complicated um so I have kind of like a

00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,570
two-part question so one is I know scrum

00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,940
rolls you're not supposed to share

00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,680
resources across multiple scrum teams we

00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,390
work at an agency and the nature of our

00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,380
work that's like kind of impossible so I

00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:19,369
was wondering do you guys share

00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:21,619
resources across teams or no yes you do

00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:24,170
so then my follow-up question to that is

00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:27,020
how do you prioritize the client work

00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:29,390
then like internally yeah so what we do

00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,460
is we actually treat the PM person on

00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,650
the other team so we've got another team

00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,930
in Zurich called know our Capetown team

00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,900
is death by burgers and so they're p.m.

00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:41,420
for their team will act as our client

00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,790
they will be the client intermediary

00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:47,180
go-between to us and we'll put them on

00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:48,710
our Tuesday sprint cadence and say for

00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,270
example Victor you're going to be with

00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,530
us on Tuesday you're going to be the

00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,210
clients we're going to go through all

00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,500
the rituals as if you were the clients

00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,450
and we're going to take all of your

00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,570
tickets for this project as if you were

00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:02,240
a client project and just add them in so

00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:03,859
depending on we won't add them if we're

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,599
obviously super busy with client with

00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:07,760
our own client work but if we have space

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,560
we might say yeah we can help you this

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,730
sprint or like will take all your

00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,960
information this sprint

00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,369
but maybe won't be able to implement

00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,410
until the following sprint or two

00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:17,030
Sprint's away and we've done that we've

00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:20,150
actually launched maybe like three or

00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:24,230
four different non Austin projects in

00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:25,970
the last since 2017 started and before

00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:28,430
that would have caused like a big like

00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,869
break in the wheel of things but now we

00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,820
have our thing we just kind of move them

00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:34,430
in they're part of the machine and they

00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,630
also understand how it works so at the

00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,670
end of the day the clients super happy

00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,869
they don't know the difference when they

00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,130
know that someone else did it but they

00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:42,930
don't know the difference in quality or

00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:45,960
or routine so they know what's expected

00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:47,400
of them and the team is able to just

00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,680
absorb the new project and kick it out

00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:56,840
like they would something internal okay

00:59:52,680 --> 01:00:02,130
and you said that you hired Anna and

00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:06,450
scrum expert so and how was the process

01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:10,260
and what recommendations can you give us

01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:12,030
to to hire the right one I actually

01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,330
can't speak to that it was all done on

01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:16,680
our Zurich side if you run into Michael

01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:18,900
here he's going to be doing a session in

01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,700
this room I think it - he'll be able to

01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,140
give you more of a rundown on how that

01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,180
worked and what they actually did in the

01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:29,610
office we only got the kind of residuals

01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:31,530
of that okay I can talk to you

01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:34,140
afterwards if you have questions but we

01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:42,340
are out of time thank you all for coming

01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:42,340
