Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Forecasting Innovation: weather.com’s Emerging Technology Story
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Keeping up with where technology is heading is difficult: not only is the landscape constantly changing, but the rate at which it is changing is accelerating. By building experience with new technologies and relationships within their constituent communities, we can partner with our clients in being leaders shaping the technologies of the future around their business needs, instead of reacting to trends by looking towards integrations after foundational decisions have already been made.

The Weather Company (an IBM business), in partnership with Mediacurrent, has an incredible track record of not just keeping up with innovation, but driving it. When weather.com originally launched on Drupal back in 2014, we set a new standard for just how high a trafficked site could be hosted on Drupal. We built a progressively decoupled site well before they became a hot topic in the Drupal world. But we didn’t stop there.

After launching the site, we began exploring integration with Angular 2, beginning that work while Angular 2 was still in Alpha state, and carrying through to its official release in September of 2016. The cost of beginning a product integration with an Alpha-state technology was significant. With each new Alpha, Beta, and Release Candidate cycle, internal API’s were being changed, leading to significant rework. To offset this cost, however, our team was able to build strong ties with Google’s core Angular team by working directly with them to improve each release. This, in turn, gave us the ability to showcase to them our specific business use case, and helped ensure their work would facilitate our needs. This collaboration culminated in being invited to participate in the keynote address of 2016’s ngconf, the premier Angular event of the year.

Meanwhile, on the Drupal side of the effort, Mediacurrent and The Weather Company have begun a Drupal 8 migration as well, and are now helping push forward Drupal 8’s core initiatives. Joining the monthly API-First meetings, we are testing and providing feedback to the core team as well as developing new integrations we are looking to release back to the community as contributed modules. This is enabling us to both solidify relationships with the team working to improve Drupal’s decoupled capabilities and offer input into how we’d like to see that process unfold.

This session will explore the history and ongoing efforts at driving innovation, as well as the business value of investing in the exploration of emerging technologies.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
one thanks for coming to forecasting

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,880
innovation whether comms emerging

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,170
technology story so by way of

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,910
introduction for those of you in the

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,099
room who don't know me I'm Jeremy

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,250
Dickens I'm the technical lead on the

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,189
CMS team with the weather company known

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,240
to many people as weather comm I've been

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,750
with TWC for two years I have been

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,150
working in Drupal for eight we're we're

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,180
also now IBM so I guess I'm big blue

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,410
which is a little odd but fortunately

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm joined by my better half Matt Davis

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,719
is my name I'm a lead Drupal architect

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,640
at media current I've been working at

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,700
media current for about three years now

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:53,340
and also working on the weather company

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,230
sites for about three years as well so

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,579
the obligatory agenda slide what are we

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,850
going to be talking about what is this

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,699
all about anyway we have our fancy Roman

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,409
numerals to show that we have class but

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,840
really this is mostly going to be a

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,880
little bit of a storytime from the two

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,640
of us talking about what our companies

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,830
have done in terms of you know how we

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,330
push technology forward I've been a

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,520
little bit uncomfortable with the

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,820
subject about like classifying myself as

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,830
an innovator I think that's fair it's

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,270
also fair when people say look at all

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,490
the crap you've done I'm like whoa well

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,750
yes I guess we have so we're going to

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,820
talk a little bit about a little bit

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,380
about what innovation is and we're gonna

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,060
talk about the three major projects

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,130
where we've that we've worked on that

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,170
have push things forward significantly

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,820
in our opinion and then we're going to

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,860
kind of wrap things up about what it is

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,479
what it means to try to innovate in

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,829
today's world all right so to kick it

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,100
off we're going to start with an

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,869
introduction to innovation and as with

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,540
all good introductions we'll start by

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,240
defining our terms so what is innovation

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,250
to innovate is to make changes in

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,979
something established especially by

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,439
introducing new methods ideas or

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,390
products innovation

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,360
I don't do voices

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,380
which is awesome right I mean so how do

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,850
I innovate

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,250
I want to innovate don't you want to

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,960
innovate you want to innovate I see you

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,840
you're doing yeah he's innovating right

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,160
now as we speak so you know you but

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,050
there's some questions around that right

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,550
like okay that's great we know what it

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,800
is but how do we do it

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,720
do I have to like get struck by an idea

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,150
like you know the bolt out of the

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,760
proverbial blue or is it like a process

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,190
can I like get the innovation checklist

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,170
and just start going down and you know

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:42,520
marking things off as I accomplish them

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,550
and even if it is based on like some you

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,460
know Eureka moment how do I follow

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,350
through on that idea in a way where you

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,660
know I can conquer the risks that come

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,400
along with it face those challenges in

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,190
order to take that idea into something

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,530
that's in production so what we're going

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,050
to be doing today is really just kind of

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,270
telling our story a story of innovation

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,940
hopefully it won't turn into a grandpa

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:10,350
Simpson rambling story it's possible

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,820
though but it will be a story of risk

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,910
which will try to be pretty honest about

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,860
the kind of risks that we encountered

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,880
during this innovation process but

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,890
ultimately it's also a story of rewards

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,120
and and we'll be happy to share the

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,830
rewards with you well some of them so so

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,410
we'll talk first about progressive

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,950
decoupling and this is the story of the

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,480
Drupal 7 weather.com site so by way of

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,310
background we at the weather company

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,580
weather calm The Weather Channel

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,880
we have what I think is it's fair to say

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,750
is a pretty weighty mission statement

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,610
where our core mission is to deliver

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,250
data to people in a timely and accurate

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,650
manner that can potentially save their

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,510
lives at very least it helps them plan

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,070
their day you know this is thing

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,110
important stuff to know what's the

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,570
weather goingto be like today do I need

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,880
a jacket do I need an umbrella is there

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,220
a tornado approaching these are things

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,170
that that we consider our core mission

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,150
that actually drives some pretty

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:21,130
significant technical requirements in

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,650
order to accomplish so we have data or

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:28,600
it concerns that's the data looking

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:31,660
concerned if you yeah yeah okay good so

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,470
whether data is highly dynamic in nature

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,930
it changes frequently right on top of

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,490
that is highly localized we have there

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,760
are places in the world where you know

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,090
you can be well it probably today you

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,480
can be in one spot and be getting poured

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,160
on and then be five minutes away and it

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,710
could be just overcast or maybe even

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,650
sunny exactly Florida for anybody who's

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,360
listening later this data is also not

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,240
some subset you know we're not just

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,970
looking at the Greater Atlanta area or

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,070
New York City this data is worldwide and

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,530
scope and we have customers around the

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,660
world that depends on this data and then

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,060
from sort of a more prosaic technical

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,340
side that data has to be sent and

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,580
consumed by people on all manner of

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,760
devices so we call it weather calm but

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,640
that also means like your mobile web

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,730
device it can mean the mobile apps it

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,160
can be people on 2g in in areas where

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,950
the Internet infrastructure is not as

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,630
good as as in the rest of the world so

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,340
that has to be a consideration then as

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,230
an organization we have certain team

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,360
oriented concerns that drove the

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,270
requirements where we had a large

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,980
existing and very competent JavaScript

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,780
team that was engaged in producing the

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,150
code that was required to service some

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,120
of this data and then we had content

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,190
teams producing videos and articles

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,650
talking about whether talking about

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,770
science talking about the latest weather

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,230
event giving news breaking news at the

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,850
moment that it happens that are around

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:19,960
the world both of those teams have huge

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:23,020
velocity requirements they can't wait on

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,130
you know a six hour code deploy window

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,620
they have to be able to make their

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:31,240
changes and publish their content right

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,860
now oh and then there's this which I'm

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,150
sure nobody else in this room has ever

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:41,270
had to worry about these concerns right

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:44,930
okay good so those challenges overall

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,180
prompted a specific approach involving

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,020
Drupal that really at the time wasn't

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,850
considered I think media current started

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,190
building the we went back and looked at

00:06:52,850 --> 00:07:00,830
the get logs the first commits were from

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:04,790
the summer of 2013 we launched live in

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:08,539
November of 2014 by way of pointing out

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,400
that the Greece's famous blog post about

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,470
the future of decoupled Drupal where he

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
apparently coined the phrase progressive

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,030
decoupling that blog post wasn't put out

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,160
until the September of 2015

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,389
nearly a year after we'd been in

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,949
production so there are other

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,199
presentations that have been made it

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:28,970
passed through pecans about kind of deep

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,410
diving the architecture and what it is

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,199
but for those of you that haven't seen

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,840
those basically we have Drupal and

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,340
angular so Drupal is providing this

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,560
highly cashable markup

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,180
it's got integrated workflows for

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,880
managing some of that markup you know

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,760
like page management but also editorial

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,260
workflows it's the source of the source

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,419
of record for the content that's created

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,389
on it and the configuration for the

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:55,370
individual components on the page but it

00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,590
connects to some data stores externally

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,330
we might get into later but then the

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,430
front-end team you know there's angular

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,289
which was even at the time well known it

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,229
was the I think the leader in the space

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,990
at the time that we launched its able to

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,240
deliver the dynamic content rendering it

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,199
on the client-side so we don't have to

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,030
save a rendered HTML page for every

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,289
single of the millions located millions

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,199
of locations that we have data points

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,849
for and for the most part no Drupal

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,320
necessary for them that's going to be a

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:30,680
key point as we go on so did we did we

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,930
meet those goals do we hit those those

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,330
challenges so we have two highly dynamic

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,300
data that solve by a combination of ESI

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:41,320
and angular localized check same thing

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,610
being able to get that worldwide got it

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,490
multiple consumers yet we have this

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,110
external data store so we can create our

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,860
content saved in the Drupal database

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,529
gets put

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,990
to the data store that you know the iOS

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,079
app can read or any other sort of like

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,120
you know I think there's a Windows

00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:02,720
application that reads in this content

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,660
so we got that one that's great so then

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,850
our team again our existing JavaScript

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,890
team not only did they get the framework

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,310
of choice at the time they didn't need

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,800
to learn a lick of Drupal mostly mostly

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,820
a little bit of form API never hurt

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,579
anybody our content teams you know they

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,160
got Drupal's content editing abilities

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:27,860
great you know it trained them on how to

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,100
use Drupal as a confident platform put a

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,750
few tweaks in here and there got it

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,970
Java Script team high velocity they can

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,610
make changes their modules no big deal

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,490
content team they can just keep checking

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,160
along like Drupal content editors

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:45,950
fantastic but one of the key points in

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,600
all of this is that the driving force

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,339
behind all of this innovation that led

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,950
us to create this progressively

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,890
decoupled architecture before the term

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,990
even existed was the specific business

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,760
requirements we weren't just out in a

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,160
field trying to dream up something new

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,100
for its own sake it was always driven by

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,370
these goals yeah I mean it's just by way

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:12,680
of the example our content team has

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,660
pretty much a 24/7 requirement they have

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,360
to be able to get into Drupal and make

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,570
their editorial changes so like long

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,190
deploy windows are right out so you know

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,930
we go through this we get it launched

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,670
it's it's up and running it's in

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,010
production we keep iterating we keep

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,660
moving and any time you build a large

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,190
software project you know you know

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,350
you're going to surface some of those

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,680
unknown unknowns and this slide is

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,740
really just you know imagine the ominous

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,130
music in the background this is the

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:47,680
aluminum totem right of our presentation

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,680
so keep this in mind he'll be back

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,860
meanwhile in San Francisco so we're

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,020
going to take a brief detour now

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,330
were to San Francisco for The Weather

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,330
Underground project so as Jeremy

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,840
mentioned weather calm had launched in

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,430
2014 November it was humming along they

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,530
were creating tons of JavaScript

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,350
components over there the platform was

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,690
really successful and what the company

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,210
began looking at was migrating its other

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,140
properties onto the same Drupal platform

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:21,750
and this process began in the oh before

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,210
I get into that build so it's a little

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,000
bit about some of our intentions when we

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,270
created this platform in the first place

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,740
from the get-go we were hoping to create

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,070
something that would be JavaScript

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,510
framework agnostic because we knew that

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,760
there was a lot of velocity in the

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,440
JavaScript world and the JavaScript

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,790
developers would like to be able to play

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,220
with different kinds of tools and the

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,140
tool of the moment can change much more

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,540
rapidly than we might be able to

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,430
accommodate but at the time there was a

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,940
lot of consensus around the internal

00:11:53,430 --> 00:12:00,180
team at the weather calm around angular

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,730
1 and so we ended up just sprinting full

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,490
steam ahead with angular 1 and in the

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,100
long run over you know after over a year

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,290
in production what we ended up with was

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,510
a platform where our progressively

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,120
decoupled model ended up being actually

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,040
more tightly coupled between Drupal and

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,820
angular 1 then we have really would have

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,010
liked and this was a problem in the long

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,580
run because even though angular was

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:28,110
mature like I mentioned the ecosystem in

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,240
the JavaScript world is moving really

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,630
really quickly and there were problems

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,180
that in angular one's own innovation

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,600
story they were servicing their unknown

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,810
unknowns as well things like components

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,730
and taking advantage of a virtual Dom

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,710
weren't possible in angular 1 but those

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,630
problems were being solved and addressed

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,690
in other ways in other kinds of

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,790
frameworks so when we came to the

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,790
Weather Underground towards the end of

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:59,550
2015 and began talking to them about

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,710
migrating them onto this platform one of

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,330
their first requests was we don't want

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,040
to build this in angular 1

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,750
we really want to be looking at the more

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,760
innovative new frameworks that are

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,950
coming out and specifically they were

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,040
really interested in exploring angular 2

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,960
which if you're not familiar it's the

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,220
deflect the difference between Drupal 7

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,440
and Drupal eight it's a ground-up

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,310
rewrite totally different frameworks

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,410
effectively so we began doing this

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,350
investigation into what it would take

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,350
both to turn our platform back to being

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,140
JavaScript framework agnostic and into

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,000
implementing angular 2 and as it turned

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,430
out when we started this process angular

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,550
2 was still in an alpha state and we

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:44,850
ended up launching our first angular 2

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,880
pages on the Weather Underground site in

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,830
April of 2016 when it was still in a

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,480
beta state now I don't know how many

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,750
people in this room have followed the

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,089
angular 2 release story but it came with

00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,810
breaking change after breaking change

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:03,720
after breaking change so we have stuff

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,580
in production many many many breaking

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,430
changes before the official release

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,130
event healer 2 and that meant we paid a

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,709
lot of bleeding-edge tax of refactoring

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,080
our components and refactoring whole

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:19,170
core pieces of our architecture and how

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,260
you can do things like dynamically

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,510
bootstrap components into a single app

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,170
when you have disparate pieces of your

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:31,380
page their angular 2 so we paid a lot of

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,930
that tax but the other side of that

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,670
story is that because we were early

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,310
adopters we were able to form really

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,650
close relationships with the core

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,870
angular team at Google and they were

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,700
actually really interested in our use

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,279
case because this progressively

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,750
decoupled kind of model wasn't how they

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,060
were originally thinking about the

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,950
framework being used so we ended up

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,350
actually helping to influence the

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,290
possibilities of where angular itself

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,860
was going by being involved that early

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,839
on and ultimately for reasons we'll get

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,900
into in a little while

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,870
Weather Underground decided to pivot to

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,870
going fully decoupled and building on

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,890
top of the angular isomorphic story

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,810
called angular universal meaning it

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:21,290
server-side and client-side rendering

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:24,260
angular and Drupal just serving pieces

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,630
of data or Escalade but what was key

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,209
about that is that because we had those

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,310
relationships already that pivot was

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,529
relatively painless we already knew the

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,730
people and had relationships with the

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,730
people who were writing angular

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,740
universal and could literally say hey

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,779
Patrick je s come down to the Weather

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,910
Underground office and let's hack on

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:48,110
this for a few hours and make a proof of

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,360
concept in a matter of days and another

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,899
big thing that came out of this kind of

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,670
innovation story is this Drupal 8 module

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,070
that you can download today called D

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,519
couple blocks this was built from the

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,640
ground up in Drupal 8 to be a JavaScript

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,350
framework agnostic there are currently

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,339
implementations in angular react and

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,680
view and actually this module is also

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:17,060
looking for a CO maintainer as well to

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:20,269
help implement other frameworks alright

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,370
so here we kind of get the scene shifts

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,410
back to weather calm and and things

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,420
aren't so great those those unknown

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,850
unknowns well we we have surfaced them

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,329
this is sort of the Empire Strikes Back

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,610
episode of our story and we're going to

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:37,880
be honest about the things that that we

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,850
had founded in that in that model so so

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,399
one of the big problems that we ran into

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,709
as we scaled this system valid I mean

00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,449
it's worth noting our goal that we

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,430
mentioned earlier was to really let the

00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:52,339
JavaScript developers have their own

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,140
independent velocity and man they did

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,750
they took advantage on it and created

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,730
hundreds of these components and they

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,130
were being placed in various ways on

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,930
different Drupal pages well all of the

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,600
dependency management of that was being

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,490
handled by Drupal itself so in our

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,669
platform we had actually written a whole

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,040
bunch of custom code in Drupal 7 to

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:15,410
manage where different JavaScript assets

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,870
were needed on any given page and take

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,939
advantage of Drupal's aggregation to try

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,339
to bundle those up and keep our

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,770
performance down now this is problematic

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,190
if you're familiar with how most of the

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,440
JavaScript world works

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,180
because there are lots of really cool

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,430
ways if you're building a JavaScript app

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,680
that you can get your sizes of your

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,490
bundles down things like minification

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,560
uglification bundling and then the big

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,870
one is tree shading where you can

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,700
actually shake out all the stuff in a

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,260
framework that you're not using to

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,810
really get your bundle size down now

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,510
tree shaking is especially important in

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:54,000
the angular 2 story because it's a huge

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,830
monolithic framework that if you don't

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,320
if you can't take advantage of tree

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,990
shaking you're shipping over a May just

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,850
for the platform itself so we knew we

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,270
wanted to be able to take care of tree

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,740
shaking but you don't want PHP to be

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,110
trying to do something like that it's

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,210
job huge huge problem space it's not

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,850
even worth diving into to try to make

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,730
PHP figure out which of your specific

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,200
JavaScript functions are being called so

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,460
this was a big problem that we kept

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,210
banging our head against that we

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,910
couldn't have foreseen going into this

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:32,190
and then you know talking about velocity

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:34,740
so it turned out that yes well they were

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,570
very very happy and very very fast at

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,310
being able to deliver these modules and

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,920
create these modules on the front end

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:44,100
you know it became a problem that they

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,100
wanted to go to a different framework or

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,830
go to angular 1.5 or angular 2 well

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,690
there was a lot of Drupal code invested

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,760
investment time needed to do that and

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,850
our team just didn't have the bandwidth

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,640
and we became a blocker for them so and

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,490
even then putting things on the page

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,500
that you know might not work in the way

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,710
the Drupal might want them would require

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,060
code reviews on our side so that's

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,330
actually the third point on the slide

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,920
honestly philosophically javascript

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,780
should be able to have its own

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,820
guardrails those guys should know what

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,620
javascript does and should be able to do

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,200
that they shouldn't have to worry about

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,280
breaking Drupal if they do something

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,990
that Drupal kind of just doesn't like

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,310
then we ran into some infrastructure

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,960
issues obviously with the way that D

00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,570
seven site works in the way that the

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,590
traffic that we have to handle we had a

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,750
complicated caching model

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,240
and on top of that we had gone with

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,370
certain caching vendors that you know

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,860
well what if the business decides we

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,110
need to move to you know a different CDN

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,200
that's going to be a problem because

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:58,010
we're built to use a particular vendors

00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,289
ESI model another thing a side effect to

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,000
the JavaScript aggregation is that

00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,700
because there were so many different

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,190
pieces of JavaScript being loaded on so

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,110
many different pages we had a problem

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,120
with the sheer number of JavaScript

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,820
aggregates that were being put onto the

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,559
file system and I don't know of anybody

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,649
else no one else has ever come to me and

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:22,789
said man we've got too many aggregates

00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:24,890
on our file system Drupal Drupal has a

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,169
default setting to keep 30 days worth

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,600
they don't expose that in the UI is just

00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:32,360
there I don't know anybody else that's

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,049
ever had to go in and say hey I only

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,049
indicate 48 hours worth so that became a

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,200
problem for the record the Gluster file

00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:43,580
system does not like it when you have

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,010
50,000 javascript files in a single

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,399
directory yeah it doesn't doesn't play

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,770
nice data consistency issues between

00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:56,450
Drupal as you know the system of record

00:20:51,770 --> 00:21:00,890
plus the external system just as another

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,659
example when you have thousands and

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,779
thousands of thousands of nodes of

00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:08,960
article content on your site and they

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,539
need to be scrubbed to change any HTTP

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,580
string to an HTTPS string that's bad

00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,130
enough when you have to push that to an

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,110
external data store at the same time

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:21,620
that's not something you want to get

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:25,909
into and then you know multi-headed

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:30,830
Drupal 7 having 8 to 12 web heads behind

00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:33,320
you know your load balancer talking to

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,760
one database maybe not such a great idea

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,059
you are going to run into some problems

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,760
that does get painful let me tell you so

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,010
these are things we were we were able to

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,559
mostly mitigate these but it was never

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,690
like clean it was never great so it

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,410
certainly made us look at oh we didn't

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,080
realize this was going

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,460
happen and have to try to come back on

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,710
the back end and spend a lot of

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,700
development time trying to fix all of

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,970
these various issues which brings us to

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:06,570
the API first initiative and our final

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,390
area of innovation and the premise this

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,710
a little bit those of you some of you

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,770
may have already kind of read into this

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,270
the implication that yes

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,760
weather calm and Weather Underground

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:22,110
both ultimately made the decision to go

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,460
fully decoupled in the long run but some

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,130
of what I think it's important to

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,770
emphasize here is that that's them not

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,830
to say that progressive decoupling can't

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,870
serve really useful purposes I think

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,670
there are lots of good use cases for it

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,700
and a lot of the problems that we

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:42,630
surface were due to the very scale that

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,250
we were operating on so as we dive into

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,390
kind of the fully decoupled story we

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,940
don't want you guys have the impression

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,350
that progressive decoupled is not ever

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,860
the right route to go actually there's

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,750
lots of good reasons to have that but

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,890
the full decoupling story as we kind of

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,800
alluded to earlier

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,620
it started with Wu once there was kind

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,360
of decided that we really were getting

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,730
exhausted by these pain points we were

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,770
surfacing in the progressive decoupling

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,560
realm we look to Wu

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,140
first Weather Underground because we

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,230
knew that we had very strong ties back

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,450
to the angular team and like I said we

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,550
literally could send Patrick J s a

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,260
message and say hey come hang out with

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,420
us at the office for a few hours and

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,180
let's look at what a proof-of-concept of

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,160
this would would would look like so we

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,960
were able to really quickly get this

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,840
spun up on the Weather Underground side

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,270
so what it's come down to from where

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,670
we're taking things here you know as

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:45,240
Drupal developers and where we are in

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,250
sort of this new next-generation world

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,900
is that we're going to provide

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,030
interfaces and those are going to be

00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,610
editorial interfaces configuration

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:56,580
interfaces but it's not just to our

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,250
content teams or our our page managers

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,740
that make you know put the data on the

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,149
on the page to be consumed it's also for

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,070
potentially machine

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,159
reading that data as well and making

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:11,820
decisions about what microservices to

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,009
include what other systems to call what

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,129
modifications might be need to be made

00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:19,889
on those records so what we're doing is

00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:23,070
we're really embracing using some re

00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:26,070
defined standards like JSON API for our

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,799
document model using JSON schema to do

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,059
our validation of that model and even

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,259
maybe some cool things that we'll get

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:37,830
into and then open API or swagger to to

00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:40,049
document those api's and really give

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,119
both the humans developing things

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,710
against them and even machines that

00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,839
might need to interface it with them a

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:52,859
good understanding of what these api's

00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:54,599
do so what it just so happens and we

00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,659
started realizing this last year in New

00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,869
Orleans that the requirements that we're

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:03,089
getting now as far as driving forward

00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:05,129
just happen to dovetail really nicely

00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:08,519
with where the whole decoupling

00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:11,519
conversation in Drupal has gone since we

00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,589
started and it was not a thing kind of a

00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,539
thing a few people were doing it - now

00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:18,029
it's a key question that everyone keeps

00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,639
asking over the course of you know this

00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,830
conference so we're putting these up

00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:25,349
there highlighting that there is an API

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,869
first initiative where they're doing a

00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:30,239
ton of great work implementing these

00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:34,169
technologies on the Drupal side

00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:36,299
matéo is doing a his JSON API module

00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:40,169
we're hoping to work really closely with

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,570
him and you know the we just got the

00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:45,599
open API space to be able to implement

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,919
swagger on the Drupal side schemata is

00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,960
very interesting if you're getting into

00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,330
this or looking at it because it also

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,389
sort of acts as this helper piece with

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,279
JSON schemas and swagger so we're really

00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,659
excited about the fact that we're

00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,239
driving forward into the space where

00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:04,979
everybody's kind of starting to coalesce

00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:06,539
and push the technology forward but of

00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:09,419
course we're going even further than

00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,849
that - because we are innovators and

00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,159
there are specific things that we're

00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:15,570
trying to push even further than where

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,120
we're hearing a lot of the Drupal

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,250
unity talking right now a big one that

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,040
I'm really passionate about is the

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,230
editorial interfaces and what we're

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,750
looking at with this project now is for

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,490
some of our key editorial interfaces

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,490
we're actually going to be decoupling

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:36,420
those as well and building single page

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:38,790
JavaScript apps to guide those along now

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,960
what's exciting about that from my

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,710
perspective is that we're going to be

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,510
using JSON API so that all of these

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,640
different systems that are interacting

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,170
with Drupal they don't have to we don't

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,510
have to care where the source of all of

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,130
these things are because to us and to

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,070
whatever other systems are consuming

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,950
these api's it's all just JSON API all

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:02,070
the way out there you want to talk about

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,750
your service oh sure yeah I mean the

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,430
fact that actually I think the one

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,910
that's really neat is the one above it

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:11,700
so being able to take in a JSON schema

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,380
document potentially and your custom

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,570
entity type automatically gets the

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,930
fields that are defined on that JSON

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:21,450
schema that again a machine another

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,530
system could be generating those given

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,290
you know some pretty complicated

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:28,050
workflows that is a use case that is

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,090
certainly out there that you know I

00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,940
think would pay big dividends in Drupal

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,980
in the long run and again Drupal being

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,110
able to talk to other micro services and

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,210
having other micro services talk to it

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,610
to be able to you know we can push

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,110
configuration to them they can tell us

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,500
about their status about their

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,690
notifications and then finally this

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,450
whole concept of being technology

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,980
agnostic Matt I'll let you take which it

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,570
really comes back to that point that I

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,060
was saying that because we have all

00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,860
these different systems that are all the

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,100
glue that's tying them all together is

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,260
this structure of JSON API so that it's

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,940
any given one of those systems if we

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,000
wanted to switch it out with something

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,410
else we could because we know exactly

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,450
what our data models are how they're

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,430
going to be structured and that's what's

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,490
tying everything together so it gives us

00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:20,700
a much broader ability to be agnostic to

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,830
the specific ways we implement things in

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,650
the long run it's worth noting about

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,200
this slide that each one of these comes

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,690
with buckets full of unknown unknowns

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,620
that

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:37,120
you haven't even dreamed up yet you know

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:38,290
this is being a little blue skies so we

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,240
are already I'm already looking at these

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,760
for man that sounds so exciting a cool

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,190
God well this is the next example of

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,810
icebergs where we could see the top when

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,820
we know some of the problems but then

00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,950
there's a hole we know that there's this

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:55,240
whole other set of problems that we

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:57,340
can't even fully realize yet right so

00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,140
let's wrap up shall we

00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:04,930
so one of the things about innovating

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,390
and being innovative I guess you know as

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,280
well what does it get me as a company

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,980
like what does it give me as was it

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,810
giving my team to be innovative and just

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,930
from the perspective that that we have

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:19,180
with IBM and CWC I mean it's pretty easy

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:23,230
to see that you know success really does

00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:25,720
breed success when you have taken on a

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,320
seemingly impossible task and been able

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,820
to solve it that really does a lot for

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,890
making you feel comfortable taking on

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,240
that next big challenge and when you

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,920
have those little oh god moments you're

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,550
like no I'm not okay it's alright we've

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,810
done this before

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:43,510
we know the drill from an organization

00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,220
when you see that your organization is

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,930
innovating or that your team is

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,870
innovating or that a team that you work

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,310
with is innovating it helps motivate

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:54,190
your team and the rest of the teams to

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,230
continue pushing forward I mean nothing

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,980
makes you feel better than even being

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,810
next to somebody who's like really just

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,790
knocking it out of the park they can

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,160
they can do wonders for yourself esteem

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,110
in your motivation levels I mean anybody

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,970
who's been to a DrupalCon before knows

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,130
that coming here and being around smart

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,830
people you come away feeling really good

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:19,750
about your work in your life you know

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:21,300
most of the time but it is it's

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,130
something that your entire organization

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,890
learns that that it gets this

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,750
motivational sense from it and you know

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,510
to that again when you're in the room

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,160
I've always said I like to be put myself

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,390
in the room with the smartest people I

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,500
don't think I'm the smartest person in

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,830
the room by far but when you get in that

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,810
situation we

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,880
you are a thought leader or you're

00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,710
perceived as a thought leader you end up

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,570
being around other thought leaders and

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,090
what that actually gives you is this

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,970
great opportunity to you know bounce

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,370
ideas off of each other or collaborate

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,600
with them directly or indirectly you can

00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,760
see where maybe they've made mistakes

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,950
where maybe they've taken a slightly

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,630
different approach you can get Eureka

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,580
moments from seeing what they're doing

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,490
they might have gone east and you're

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,900
going southeast and then you realize

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,580
that you kind of went around the

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,780
mountain two different ways and you

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,880
realize there's a whole different

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,590
mountain but now you know you can kind

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,460
of do it so I think that's really

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,350
important and you know getting into how

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,020
we've partnered like with media current

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,940
it's been great because that is how what

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,590
our relationships like and I think when

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,240
you come to a Drupal con that's what

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,100
it's like is your look at what

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,450
everybody's doing and it makes you feel

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,430
good and it makes you feel confident

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,890
that you can take these challenges on

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,880
and you you can actually succeed at them

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:44,480
anteye perhaps also see lightning snow

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,340
and as someone working for a Drupal

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,540
agency as well there's tons of benefits

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,830
that we get not just raining money one

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,750
of the things is that as we establish

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,910
ourselves as you know being at the

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,090
forefront for example of working with

00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:02,150
angular that attracts developers who are

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,650
interested in ways to combine Drupal and

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,840
angular they want to work for media

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:09,020
current because they see us as helping

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,670
to lead the path there obviously we you

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,090
know we've produced a lot of material in

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,370
terms of blogs and webinars and videos

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,110
that can have marketing value and drive

00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,270
people back to our site who are curious

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,270
about all the things that media current

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,950
does and ultimately you know that's that

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,840
can be really appealing to clients who

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,150
are trying to figure out similar

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,860
problems we've already wrapped our head

00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,210
around and been at the forefront of

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,590
solving all right so this was also a

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,360
little weird cuz it will advice for

00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,890
innovators you have and look we're

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,230
struggling for headlines at this point

00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:47,000
yours look you've got slides guys a

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,320
problem so just some it made it made

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,270
mattaniah like to have some discussions

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,020
about maybe what we've learned from all

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,860
this work and what you know

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,570
as technologists what are the things

00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,830
that we might say to someone else who's

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,120
you know coming up some of these

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,150
problems we're trying to figure out how

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,470
they can fit in or even a larger

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,440
organization trying to figure out if

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:11,220
they're how to manage the treacheries of

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,380
the modern technological world first off

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,030
you just have to admit that risks are

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,760
inherent in everything we do day to day

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:20,280
but especially in the line of work that

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,680
we're in and you just have to understand

00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,720
them as best you can

00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,260
and then expect that there will be

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,140
problems that you didn't see my big role

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,720
models in life are actually a you know

00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,640
astronauts and the team behind them that

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,920
sent people to the moon and send people

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,810
to space and you know they went into a

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,390
complete unknown and engineered a

00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:45,570
solution by trial and error and the

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,310
stakes were incredibly high but they

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,170
were able to mitigate those risks and

00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,810
when they didn't and fail they were able

00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:55,680
to pick themselves back up in order to

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,510
eventually succeed yeah one of the key

00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,930
things there in terms of risk evaluation

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:03,570
is not just the engineering team having

00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,310
some understanding of going into

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,560
unforeseen territory but making sure

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,870
that all the stakeholders who are

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,929
involved in a project really understand

00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:14,669
that yes there are risks we can see but

00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:17,669
there's a whole bunch of risks that we

00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:20,250
can't even fully comprehend yet and

00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:22,620
having their buy-in as well that it's

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,679
worth going down that road to create

00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:27,450
something really new and the key thing

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,240
though that we're really trying to

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:33,390
emphasize here is finding collaborators

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,970
and partners whether it's a partnership

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:38,280
like TWC and Media currents or whether

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:41,580
it's people at a boss that you meet at

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,700
DrupalCon finding other people who are

00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,830
interested in similar problem spaces and

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,290
really jumping in with them and diving

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,179
in for the long haul in figuring out how

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,919
you can collaborate together because

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,050
innovation is never something that just

00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:58,340
happens in a vacuum it's something that

00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:01,200
we can all contribute to together

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:08,250
and that's it thank you very much thank

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:11,130
you everybody and we have plenty of time

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:20,250
for questions so feel free to approach

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:22,560
the mic hi my name is uncle Gupta and

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,420
great presentation there I had a

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,220
question so I kind of looked at your

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,640
previous case study right so when you

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,650
did your drupal 7 and angular you know

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,500
sort of set up so one of the use cases

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,880
was to control layout and how do you

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,930
manage that in a bully decoupled

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,080
environment

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:47,550
good question creepers you um it's

00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,230
secret that is actually what we were we

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:53,340
are work that that's that's literally

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:55,800
phase one for us is is building a system

00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,080
that allows that in a decoupled world

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,020
that's all I can say in in the Drupal

00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,810
seven realm of you know our Drupal seven

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,280
site was built heavily on panels if

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,220
you've seen some of the previous case

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,560
studies and in that Drupal seven world

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,570
there's actually a restful panels module

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,730
that you can use that's awful yeah

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,110
you're the other guy there you go so

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,510
that's one example

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,840
this guy way you could have a have a

00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,880
layout that's driven by an editor and

00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,800
then it's actually the entire layout and

00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,490
the contents of a page or put out as

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:35,610
JSON that can be consumed by a separate

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:37,740
front-end so trying to be agnostic with

00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,690
your technology thinking forward you're

00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,700
decoupling the front-end you're

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,680
decoupling the editor interface here

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,570
have everything defined in your JSON

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,280
schema at what point is Drupal not

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,260
necessary that's a really good question

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,650
to have you had conversations internally

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,420
about that oh yeah yes absolutely and

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,340
that I mean that is the reality that we

00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,710
face right is that in in terms of our

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,990
overall stack Drupal is in some ways

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:04,050
becoming a smaller and smaller piece of

00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,820
that stack but it's also in another way

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,740
it's kind of the glue that's finding a

00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,960
lot it's a lot of it together as well

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,550
because what Drupal is really good at in

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,040
its largest strength I think it was

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,990
mentioned in the keynote today is data

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,180
bottling and handling really complex

00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,660
data structures and that's still the

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,580
role that Drupal is serving in this

00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,230
model as we move forward now one of the

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,830
other things I'll say about that is is

00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,690
that we're also really looking at ways

00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,360
that the kind of ideas that we're

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,250
playing around with here can help shape

00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,490
the future of where drupal's headed as

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,230
well so things like like the session

00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,119
that Preston so is going to be giving I

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,340
think it's tomorrow called decoupled

00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,290
from the inside out where there are

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,970
people that's a core conversation where

00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,140
some of the core people are really

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:54,830
exploring ways of making Drupal more

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:58,050
micro-service II or completely decoupled

00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:00,780
out-of-the-box so we do think there are

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:03,600
there notions here that could help guide

00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,420
forward ways that we could really grow

00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,030
the entire Drupal platform as well and

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,450
and I'll say not only that I mean if I

00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:15,000
think it it's boovs the rest of the CMS

00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:19,590
world and the technology world for

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,630
Drupal 2 to be a leader in in embracing

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,570
API first methodologies and having those

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,090
technologies out of the box I mean I

00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,730
think that would drive adoption and

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:34,100
certainly inform the conversation about

00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:37,020
how systems do that in general so yeah

00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,290
so I work for a small delay the small

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:43,680
weather company in Oklahoma and over the

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,600
Oklahoma Mesonet not us but we have a

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,359
small team at state and university

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,490
driven and we're completely moving to

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,960
Drupal so it is all all new kind of in

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,060
the planning stages getting anything

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,720
ready but everything is pretty much the

00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,310
same way as you know very localized data

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,740
tons of data coming from Heights all

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,840
over the state reporting every 5 minutes

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,800
you know there's constant so it is your

00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:10,080
is Drupal handling the weather data not

00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,580
necessarily okay good know

00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,290
so we you know we'll also have you know

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,360
weather entries to where people can go

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,910
in and edit edit maps or at an info

00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,070
about weather parameters and edit news

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,720
articles and things like that so that

00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,250
would be the main use for that and then

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,560
the main structure for the site you know

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,840
your general navigation and stuff but I

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,550
guess my question to you is what would

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,320
you recommend for a small team and we

00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,080
have like maybe three people that are

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,210
going to be working on this and you know

00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,560
things that we can do to help us in this

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:46,260
move so generally for a small team going

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,380
fully decoupled maybe over architected

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,090
yeah lucien and if you can avoid it

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,950
unless you really understand the kind of

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,770
complexity to your stack that it brings

00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,880
along with it it might be worth really

00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,460
looking at the kind of progressive

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,130
decouples model and honestly I would

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,190
suggest specifically looking at the B

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:07,110
couple blocks kind of kind of model

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,150
because that's a way that you can just

00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,640
take the very specific parts of your

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,670
page in Drupal 8 that need to be really

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,200
localized and dynamic and pass those off

00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,200
to some JavaScript framework of your

00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,800
choosing almost anything else that I'd

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,950
say is is almost CMS 101 stuff I mean

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,780
make sure that you model your data data

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,270
types accurately make sure you know how

00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,890
to categorize your content you're going

00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,170
to want to be pushing content to people

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:37,500
on demand make sure you've got a

00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,990
strategy in a solution for keeping the

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,210
content fresh make sure you look at your

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,670
editorial you eyes but everybody's happy

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,340
with them when you get started because

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,830
for a newsroom having that editorial

00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,020
velocity is huge and when that starts

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,270
getting unwieldy because you've got too

00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,490
many places that you need to assign

00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,240
categorization like too many texana me

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,440
fields that can really hurt people so

00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,760
definitely bear that in mind as you're

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,070
building out first off awesome

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,550
presentation thank you thankful loss for

00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,840
sure I know you guys are super vested on

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:17,700
the angular side of things but

00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,950
if you did run through any test

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,740
implementations of other libraries like

00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,540
reactor it's funny because we've given

00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,640
the impression that we're super heavily

00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,680
in the angular here but the truth is

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,810
where we are using react as well on the

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,360
wthr.com yeah this is this is the whole

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:38,080
thing like one of the drivers was when

00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,920
we launched angular was the thing and

00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,170
now you know there's I mean you know

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,120
there's too many frameworks almost but

00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,110
and one of the challenges that we have

00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,250
in our d7 is that the investment of

00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:54,640
development resources into making it

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:57,400
work with just any framework out of the

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,890
box is just it's too much it's too heavy

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,000
do couple blocks on the other hand has

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,340
the idea that maybe you would have a

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,630
site a d8 site where you would choose

00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:10,060
one but that you wrap the you basically

00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,560
wrap some code some metadata around the

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,840
framework itself and tell Drupal how to

00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,900
embed it but that could be what handlers

00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,240
exist right now for that react view

00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,700
angular - I think there's a number one

00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,150
in progress as well but from our team

00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,520
side like our our first forays into

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,950
decoupling are live and they're based on

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,570
well they're originally based on react I

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,060
don't I think they may have changed that

00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:44,560
the front-end teams they're busy they're

00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:46,420
using inferno inferno yeah so cool well

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,130
if there are no other questions feel

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,850
free to come up and talk to us up you're

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,370
free

00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,469
thank you so much

00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,469
