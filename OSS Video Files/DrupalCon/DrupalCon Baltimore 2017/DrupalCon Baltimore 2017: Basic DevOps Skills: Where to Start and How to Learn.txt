Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Basic DevOps Skills: Where to Start and How to Learn
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Have you ever felt like devops people are speaking a different language? Do you have the vague sense that “the devops” will make you go faster but you are not sure how? This is the session for you.

How we work is at least as important of an investment as the actual work we do. Leveling up with some basic devops skills is just as valuable as investing time into leveling up with PHP7, CSS3, or agile processes. These are the skills that will make you get better faster and then can enshrine the best of you in an automated task.

We will start with some collective hand-wringing about what “devops” is and then give ourselves permission to decide that it is a set of skills and processes that are worth developing. Then, we will get into what is worth your time and what is not. Those topics include:

Scripting the boring stuff
NGINX config explained using only the 1000 most common English words
Getting started with Continuous Integration
Networking and text manipulation commands that will make your colleagues think you are a wizard
