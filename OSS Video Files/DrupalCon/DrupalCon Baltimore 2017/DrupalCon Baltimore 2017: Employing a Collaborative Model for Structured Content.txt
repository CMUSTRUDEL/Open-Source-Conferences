Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Employing a Collaborative Model for Structured Content
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	It is considered best practice in website development to create a content model. The content strategist assesses the existing content, defines the fields, and passes it to the designers and developers to execute.

But the content model can be much more relevant if we ask questions that are often neglected. What is the context in which the project will live? What are the relationships between the entities unique to this project? What metadata is needed to support the design? What are our expectations of the design and build teams?

When content modeling takes these questions into consideration it can support the creation of meaningful communications, thus providing clarity for design and development. We can make the job of the designer and developer more effective if we include them in the conceptualization of the content model.

In this session, we will discuss the importance of the content model in driving and supporting design and development. We will look at how to use the content model to document the context of the project, as well as to aid in designing visual patterns, metadata, and message.

You will come away from this session having learned:

The importance of scalable, reusable content
The need to work as a team to create a common vocabulary
The relationship between structured content, design, and metadata
Designers, developers, content creators, and UX experts will all leave this session with a fresh appreciation of how content can create a common framework for project success.

hey good afternoon everyone I'm Dirk

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,429
owner from side of health studios we are

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,790
a drupal agency in Fairfax Virginia

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:16,199
we specialize in nonprofit and

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,369
government websites I have been involved

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,020
in data for my entire career I started

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:26,099
doing survey data collection work and

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,439
then moved into data warehousing and the

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:33,210
thing that really made me understand

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,660
that I got what structured data was all

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:42,629
about was when I started studying food

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:45,690
and wine so when you work in the food

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,780
and wine industry there's a common

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,270
vocabulary everybody uses so if you're

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,149
talking about wines in Bordeaux there's

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,550
a certain set of categories that that

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,739
surround that there are certain grape

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:05,820
varietals and chateaus and rules on how

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:11,310
vines can be structured when I took a

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,650
class in wine education I was trying to

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,130
figure out why the other people in the

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,100
room who are all in the industry

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:22,380
couldn't pass any of the tests and I had

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,119
no problem so every time we had a test

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,939
and you did really well they gave you a

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,280
really nice bottle of wine it was a

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,460
really great incentive to actually study

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,259
and pass the test but I didn't have that

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,810
much trouble and I was trying to figure

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,100
out for the life of me why am I not

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,579
having trouble with this and everyone

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,579
else is and I came down to understanding

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,920
that I knew what structured content was

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,500
I knew what tech comedies were I know

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,780
how to classify things and so as we were

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,220
learning all this information it was

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,189
just kind of going in with me I was like

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,460
made perfect sense I had no problem with

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,350
it and so that's why I decided that in

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,810
food and wine were going to be my go-to

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,850
topics when I was going to discuss

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,179
structured content with it with you know

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,030
a group like yourselves it's a really

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,590
easy concept to understand you know like

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,040
a recipe

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,410
very simple to help people engage in

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,170
what structured content is all about and

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,150
I figured since it was easy for me to

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,890
learn this stuff that way maybe it'd be

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,750
easy for everyone else to learn it as

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,640
well so recipes are my go-to and today

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,540
we are going to build the my french

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,230
recipe website so you can start to think

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,879
about what structures are here that

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,560
allow us to create a home page that

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,049
looks like this so very basic we seem to

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,500
have some featured chef at the top with

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,989
a recipe we seem to have categories of

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,700
recipes below it each of which has some

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:02,459
sort of an image it has a title and G it

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,170
also has a cooking time so why might

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,329
that be important to somebody coming to

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,349
a recipe website well how much time do

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,510
you have at the end of the day to

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,400
actually make a meal you know is it

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,349
Saturday and you're having guests is it

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,569
you know Thursday night and the kids are

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,880
running around like mad so this is the

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,480
website we're going to keep coming back

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,829
to today to show the examples of

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,489
structured content it's very easy when

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,489
you're dealing with recipes to think

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:35,849
that it just looks like this it's just

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,910
one big great blob of content and if

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,310
you're at the mass IT session about an

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,470
hour ago they were talking about how

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,190
they had to change the mindset of the

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,620
content creators to get away from just

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,190
putting in a blob of content into

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,769
structuring it and how valuable that was

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,130
for them in reuse of content when

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:03,750
content is unstructured like this you

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:07,560
can't share it you can't reuse it you

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:11,669
can't tag it you can't have

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,010
relationships with it the web just sees

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,750
that that's just one piece of content it

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,979
doesn't know how to parse it out into

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:23,340
information okay when you move into

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:26,800
structured content you're giving the

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,979
content the opportunity to free itself

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,699
to be reused not just on your website

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:37,000
but in other ways that are organized and

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:40,780
logical and classifiable with metadata

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,569
so whether you're working in blogs in

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,110
the social space email whether you want

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,949
Google to start picking up your content

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,990
structuring it gives you that

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,940
opportunity structuring gives you the

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,909
chance for somebody to come in and

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,580
understand what your content is and by

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,409
someone we don't mean a person because

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,419
obviously a person can read that same

00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,370
page no matter how we've structured it

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,590
but we're talking about other

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,990
applications being able to come in and

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,159
find the content on your website and

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,590
actually use it okay and that's what

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:19,090
makes this so important we want to turn

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,460
this content into information that is

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,699
not only readable by humans but is also

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:29,289
readable by machines so reusable chunks

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:32,139
that are scalable that um basically

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:35,830
divorce how the information is being

00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,539
displayed on any particular device so we

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,099
don't care if it's being displayed on a

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:42,490
watch or it's being displayed on a

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:45,190
monitor we want that information to be

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:51,340
free to be display whatever way it's

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:54,190
best suited for the device okay so in

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,789
that way our content has now become data

00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,289
and that data can be classified reused

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:05,259
and understood by other machines

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:08,289
Brad Frost is kind of a leader in this

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,139
industry as far as saying content is

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,210
going to go anywhere so you have to

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,060
start separating the content from the

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,479
presentation and whether it's going to

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,490
be a wearable your refrigerator telling

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,669
you what you're out of that you don't

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,219
have enough eggs for that recipe whether

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,800
it's the Tesla the Stu's display is

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:31,990
actually powered by Drupal no matter how

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,819
your data is going to be displayed you

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,990
shouldn't have to worry about it you

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,149
should be worrying about how your

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,500
content is structured so that it can be

00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:38,849
picked up and displayed in many

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,240
different

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:47,759
waise when you give up that control you

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,369
freed the data a simpler example that

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,669
might be very relevant to everyone in

00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:55,860
the room is simply change it in one

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,319
place and repurpose it in multiple

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,499
places on your website this is simplest

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,929
reuse example we can have so I go in as

00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:06,389
a content editor I change the date on

00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:09,779
this particular event and then my home

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,029
page changes my resource page changes my

00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,519
topic area page changes everything

00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:18,779
changes because I haven't tracked that

00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,610
date field into a body tag what I've

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,519
done is put the date field in its own

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:28,769
field where it belongs and let that you

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:31,559
know go throughout the website so what

00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:34,679
this talk is really all about is who's

00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:36,149
responsible for doing this and how do we

00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:39,479
work together to make this happen

00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:42,089
because we're not all working in silos

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,559
for ourselves we're working for a

00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:45,089
project we're working for an

00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,569
organization we're working for an

00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:51,119
institution so I wanted to take one

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,849
minute max maybe 30 seconds because this

00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:55,649
is a lightning talk 30 seconds turn to

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,399
the person next to you in front of you

00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:02,009
behind you and tell them who you are in

00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,139
terms of are you project manager or your

00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,930
content strategist or your designer are

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,449
you UX are you developer what is your

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:13,639
role when it comes to building websites

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,639
and it gives you 30 seconds to do that

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:55,410
all right finish up how many people were

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,089
sitting next to somebody who does a

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,089
completely different job than they do

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:04,050
it's sitting next to someone who does a

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,440
completely different job has a different

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,459
role

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,040
hands again look around every hand went

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,339
up almost every hand went up so the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,149
question is why do we work like this why

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,790
are we sitting in cubicles the reason

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,420
that I am so passionate about this topic

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,209
is because somebody once handed me a

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,959
wireframe and said this was the spec for

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,800
the website

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:34,319
it had to be pixel perfect according to

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,139
the spec and it did not have a single

00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:39,029
bit of information about the content not

00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,920
where it was coming from not what was

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:46,440
expected of anyone and they basically

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,430
proverbially threw it over the wall and

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,670
said build this any ones have that same

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,439
experience anyone here think that that

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,540
could work at all was that a good

00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:59,240
project I've never worked with that

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,370
person again ever

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,300
so let's just start breaking apart what

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,639
it is that are the the components of

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,920
building structured content and who's

00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,319
responsible for them and you can see

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,240
exactly why this happens all the time

00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,000
because it looks like it's a linear

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,920
process so you know you start in one

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
place and people start you know thinking

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,089
about what the content should look like

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,860
and people start designing what the

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,540
content should look like and you kind of

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,759
feel like well the think each person

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,290
hands the paper to the design any person

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,230
who hands the paper to the developer

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,529
person and off we go and that's exactly

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,329
where it breaks down by understanding

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,579
what each of those roles does and what

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,620
it's what each person is responsible for

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,680
we start building empathy between our

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,209
teams and we become one single team so

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,160
that is the boldest talk is to get you

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,800
to feel like you are part of the content

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,230
creation team okay

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,130
so to begin with we have three

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,190
activities that pretty much run in Paris

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,650
No one after another creating a domain

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,480
model creating a Content model and

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,070
building content types and generally we

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,320
think of the content strategist as the

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,500
person who handles that it might be an

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,880
analyst it might be your project manager

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,770
none of these are in stone as to who

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,350
does it because I know for instance

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,580
where I am you know a lot of times I'm

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,460
going to be doing everything on this

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,910
chart but imagine having the hat on at

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:29,540
the time the outputs of these three

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,240
processes end up going into some sort of

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,100
content creation process you know we

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,880
need to build the content based on the

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,950
content model and the wireframes and so

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,580
we have the authors of content creators

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,290
and UX designers involved at this point

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,870
that stuff always moves on to visual

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,520
design show me some comms if we're still

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,400
doing comms which we can talk our

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,370
clients out of doing and we have some

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,230
graphic designer involved in that and

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,390
then all of that stuff kind of moves on

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,070
to the end and candy gets dumped on the

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:06,980
developers and told hey build this and

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,500
of course the developers never really

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,730
spoke to the content people and the

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,590
content people might have made

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,420
assumptions that the developers know how

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,120
to build a recipe content how could they

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,040
not know what a recipe is right why

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
would it possibly be a developer's

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,250
responsibility to build out that content

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,600
type without any guidance and then again

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:32,720
could the developer provide additional

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,720
forethought to the content strategist so

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,860
that maybe they can do a better job

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,260
because our developers kind of know

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,310
stuff that some content writers don't

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,760
know either so it goes both ways okay

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:50,000
so to begin with the first process here

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,370
is a domain model a lot of organizations

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,010
don't do this a lot of times this is

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,680
really part of discovery where you're

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,060
just kind of figuring out what are the

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,060
pieces and parts what are the

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,030
relationships between things on on this

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,360
website so if I'm building this you know

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,900
website that is the my French recipes

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,340
magazine website a recipe on that

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,020
fight is going to have different

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:19,940
characteristics and a recipe on a

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:23,240
restaurant website or you know in in

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,910
somebody else's magazine if there's

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,160
context around that you can't just say

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,870
well a recipe is this and that's all

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,850
that's going to matter you have to look

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,150
at the whole environment in which that

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,730
website is going to be used so here we

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,920
have a domain model that shows there are

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,650
going to be contributors there's going

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,760
to be ratings there's going to be

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,010
ingredients there's going to be stores

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,780
that sell the ingredients so we're just

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,630
kind of plotting out what it is that

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,940
this domain looks like and coming up

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,010
with all the entities and kind of how

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,350
they're related to each other so you

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,380
know a recipe consists of processes and

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,330
has categories and people submit the

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:08,780
recipes and so this is a very high-level

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:12,200
understanding of what's going on then of

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:15,710
course we're going to build a Content

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,650
model out of that so for those of you

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,450
who really are have never been involved

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,070
in the front-end and wondered well where

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,480
where where the content types ever

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,460
defined in the first place

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,910
this is kind of where's is where that's

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,730
happening kind of on paper not really

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,170
part of of Drupal unless you're wearing

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,610
the same hat all the way through the

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,620
project and you're probably skipping

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,990
right to building content types but this

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,830
gives us an opportunity to look at all

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,150
the attributes that are in every entity

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,130
determine whether these entities are

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,260
nodes or the content types or they

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,090
taxonomy are they're going to be to no

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,300
relation entity relationships between

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:58,370
them so this is our our content modeling

00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:01,460
activity and then we have the content

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,160
types themselves and again if you have

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,860
somebody responsible for defining all of

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,470
this let's get the attributes down

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,470
before a developer has to worry about

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,990
building them what widgets are we going

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,060
to use for the date how many different

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,610
ingredients are there is it going to be

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,350
one filled with ingredient and text are

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,050
we going to have some reusable things

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,880
like a quantity field that can be

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,550
teaspoons tablespoons

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,830
are we going to have fields that are

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,240
actual ingredients where we can reuse

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:37,850
the ingredients over and over again

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,230
tomato paste onions beef so this is the

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,710
point in time when all of this stuff

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,280
needs to be evaluated we don't want to

00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,870
get to a point where it it's built and

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,020
somebody made a decision about content

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,510
types and then we go but what about and

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,640
I have to type in the word tomato every

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,950
single time I use this field and this is

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,290
starting to drive me crazy we don't want

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,390
to get to that point we want to be here

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,700
this is why it's so valuable for

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,700
developers and content strategists to be

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,740
together here because a content

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,690
strategist and in fact one who maybe has

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,340
never worked in Drupal might not

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,830
understand the power of what we can do

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,530
in a content type so let's start

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,710
bringing some of that knowledge to the

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:23,240
front of the game and start building

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,450
those content types with the knowledge

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:31,070
that Drupal has the most amazing ability

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:34,090
to do structured content and then we're

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:37,370
moving on building our wireframes and

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,530
you know we we start to see where

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,960
relationships and and these entities

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,770
starts coming into play that I'm going

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,700
to have a featured chef and somehow

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,470
somebody's going to have to be able to

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,940
say who that featured chef is at any

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,040
given time is that something that's

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,260
going to get triggered is it something

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,640
that somebody's going to put flag on are

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,160
they going to throw it in a node queue

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,620
how exactly are we going to indicate

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,900
this as we start thinking about

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,520
requirements coming into play the same

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,829
time we're doing wireframes the same

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,040
time we're validating that our content

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,199
models actually going to work for us so

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,300
we have in this example you know we can

00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,339
see that we've decided that different

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,949
types of recipes are going to have

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,810
different displays on the page so those

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,430
types of recipes obviously are

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,180
indicating there's a taxonomy

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,730
classification so in order for this page

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,890
to work way back when we did the content

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,920
model we needed to know there was going

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,350
to be some taxonomy involved and then of

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,610
course the different elements we know

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,030
we're going to have a title we know

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,530
we're going to

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,000
a short description you need a short

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,560
description in here you don't want to

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,110
just like suck out the first four

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,570
hundred characters of the description of

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,760
the recipe that'll be ridiculous he's

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,010
going to control for that right people

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,080
stick in block quotes and images and all

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,780
sorts of junk in a big open body field

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,340
so give people a field in which they can

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,960
put a short description and say that

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,000
short description is going to be used on

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,170
these you know on these landing pages

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,110
and in fact get away from the lorem

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,950
ipsum altogether start having your

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,560
content folks writing content based on

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,200
that content model while all of this

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,480
elvish stuff's going on if we have

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,170
sample content we can start seeing if

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,260
it's going to work

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,270
way back in wire framing we don't have

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,800
to wait until it's a prototype up we

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,650
don't have to wait until the site starts

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,660
getting built and then okay it's we're

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,490
close enough for the content people to

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,320
start using it and putting things in

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,500
that is way too late to make those

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,180
decisions so this is a great point in

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,130
which we start bringing in more and more

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,900
people we start bringing in designers

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,090
designers are going to maybe be using

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,610
you know atomic design principles

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,320
patterns whatever they need to know

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,890
what's available are they going to have

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,530
prep time cook time and servings

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,990
available to them in the data that gives

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:10,430
them a whole different view of what can

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:13,760
be displayed out to the audience and and

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:16,040
how to display it so you end up with way

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,290
more dynamic way more interesting sites

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:24,140
by breaking things out into structured

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:27,050
content on the development side a lot of

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,810
you've seen and done this so you've

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,550
built the content types so we want to

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:35,180
make sure that developers are not

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,650
responsible for determining what the

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,900
fields are here and what the

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,660
relationships are that they do this in

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,810
concert with all the other roles they

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,960
bring their expertise to bear on

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:51,070
building them and are able to say well

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,279
hey did you want to pop up menu

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,830
you want drop-down elements content

00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:00,519
strategist might not even realize that

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,919
they have those options so let's have

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:07,950
our developers play a much larger role

00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:10,690
in finishing the content model and

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,029
having some at least a base to work from

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,519
from somebody like a Content strategist

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:17,440
and so of course we have our normal

00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,450
entity references we have term

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,190
references we're able to relate things

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,889
to each other we're able to categorize

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,860
the data that's something that Drupal

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:29,200
does really really well and we should be

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,799
using structured content as much as

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,159
possible in our in our Drupal

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:40,049
applications additionally if you are at

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:44,740
a session this morning about displaying

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:48,009
content in Drupal 8 something very

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,740
similar to this was discussed where

00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,980
there are so many different ways to

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,200
structure and display the pages we you

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,350
can structure and display the pages in

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,230
any way shape or form if that content is

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,000
trapped in a body field once you start

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,009
breaking it out into fields and you can

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,889
start telling those fields where to go

00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,350
on the page then you start really seeing

00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:14,259
the value of obstructed content and

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,330
developers can really start working to

00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:19,419
create a site that's extremely dynamic

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,330
and flexible at the same time our

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:25,480
content creators don't have to worry

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,629
about remembering what goes in the body

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,269
field so it's like oh gee I forgot to

00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:34,389
put in how many servings or I forgot to

00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:35,980
put the the calorie count in they

00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:37,360
shouldn't have to forget anything

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,549
because they shouldn't have to remember

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,179
in the first place

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:45,759
ok all the fields should be predefined

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,519
predetermined proper dropdowns proper

00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,549
select widgets however it is that you're

00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,669
going to structure this you make it

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:57,250
easier for them at first there could be

00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:59,470
a lot of pushback they can say but I

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,299
want to just put in what I want to put

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,100
in I actually still have a client the

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,160
other day tell me but that line has to

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,790
be blue

00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,730
so it's really hard to get them away

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:12,920
from that call feeling like they they

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,680
know how it looks best on the screen

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,830
they should be collaborating as a

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,110
wireframe level as the the design level

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,000
the comp level to figure out how it

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,710
looks on the screen but we need to make

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,570
it easier for them to maintain standards

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,770
standard presentation standard

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,560
information

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,410
really by creating structured content

00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,420
really being able to say this is the

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,430
format for this particular field and

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,910
this is what's what's going to work for

00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,790
us

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,760
a really good way to get people to

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:49,030
understand this is if you have just a

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:55,000
little bit of understanding of

00:22:49,030 --> 00:23:01,670
schema.org so schema.org is a

00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,610
collaborative Google Yahoo game that

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:08,120
basically classifies everything in the

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:10,010
world if you go and you look for recipe

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,550
and schema.org you actually get this

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:16,220
back this is what they're considering

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:19,730
the a reasonable classification a

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,130
reasonable set of parameters for recipe

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:27,860
if you were to go in and look for like

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:31,190
music you know like you could find songs

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,690
and and song links and and artists and

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,790
how they're all related to each other

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,400
and just about any industry that you

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,260
look for you can go to schema.org and

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,390
start getting a good sense of what

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,550
information should I be including in my

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,520
content model for the subject matter

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:48,350
that I'm dealing with so you can go in

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,960
here and see that they have you know

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,890
durations for prep time and cook time

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,180
and there's nutritional information

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,920
there's cuisine

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,350
there's ingredients there's instructions

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,090
there's total time there's all this

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,340
wonderful information and it tells you

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,840
what kind of information they expect it

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,380
to which format they expect it to be in

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,540
and this is really really valuable stuff

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,880
and so you can be working with your

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,010
subject matter experts at determining

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,309
well what is it that it is appropriate

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,379
for us what

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:23,850
take away from this what can we add to

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:27,629
it is it all needed how can we work the

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:30,929
world's view of what a recipe is into

00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:34,769
our domain of how we want our recipes to

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:37,889
work for our audience and there's even

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,360
this really cool little tool that Google

00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:41,269
provides which is a structured data

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,320
testing tool so I'm not going to go into

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:45,779
technically how do you get your micro

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,879
data into your code but once you've got

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,309
it there you can run this tool and it

00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:54,090
will remap what it finds in your code

00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:57,960
back into the schema.org mappings and

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:00,600
tell you what it's using which is really

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,690
really valuable now we're starting to

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,950
get into why are we doing this in the

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,019
first place so you had your content

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,730
strategist and you have your designers

00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,789
and your content creators and your

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,590
developers and your UX folks and as I

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,600
said you should all be working together

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,879
with the reason we all need to work

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,340
together is because we have one single

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:25,710
mission and that is whoever hired us

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,869
whether it's a client whether it's your

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,330
employer whether it's a religious group

00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:32,700
whether it's a university whoever you

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,340
are working for you're working as a team

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,369
to do something for them you're choosing

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,230
a goal for them their web presence or

00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:46,679
whatever else they're doing with their

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:49,259
data you know marketing whatever your

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,289
job is to make sure that that data that

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:55,289
information is useable to them and

00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:57,809
achieve their business goals so when we

00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:01,289
work together and we do things like put

00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:03,090
in microdata or we put in metadata we

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:04,980
start to come up better in search

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,249
engines because the search engines can

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,639
find our information okay so we know

00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:13,889
just have titles and descriptions but we

00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:16,409
have the image coming up we have the

00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:20,429
ratings coming up we have the calories

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:26,250
coming coming up this is what will make

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:29,879
it a much better opportunity for our end

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,140
users to find us and for the mission of

00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:35,370
the website as a whole

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,890
it's not you can't see your job in a

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,860
vacuum you can't just say well I'm just

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,400
the designer you're part of a bigger

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,900
team and that team has a responsibility

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,670
so when you start using structured

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,549
content to meet the business

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:54,090
requirements that your website needs to

00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:57,780
meet you start really helping your end

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:01,470
users and your business unit to do

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,710
better social sharing is the same thing

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,630
when you start tagging your content

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,429
which you can now do because you all

00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,400
know you're going to put your image in a

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,919
field it's not going to be in the body

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,429
you can say the Facebook hey use this

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,500
image you can you can use Open Graph and

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,540
say use this image when somebody shares

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,059
out this page here's the field that that

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,190
image is in and you can specifically say

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:29,490
that page by page content type by

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,929
content type and tell Google until tell

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,910
Facebook I want to use this particular

00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,910
image I want to use this particular

00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,799
description so you can might have like

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,320
five paragraphs on that page but you

00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,540
might also have a field that's holding a

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,490
short summary and you can tell it that

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:48,090
that's the summary I want Facebook to

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:50,970
share out there's a lot of value that

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:55,740
can be added when you can start tagging

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:59,330
all these fields for Facebook for Google

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:05,340
for Twitter for any other social purpose

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:07,590
for your emails for any other microsites

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,720
any sites that are doing sharing anyone

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,270
who can come in if you expose your data

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,700
anybody can come in and start scraping

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:20,250
and picking it up and know specifically

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:23,280
what it's for so we've built a common

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,070
model now we've shared the language and

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,320
we've collaborated and by doing that

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,169
we're now creating content that can be

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,299
reused that has enormous business value

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:36,660
has become a huge business asset and

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,520
that is really the goal so the content

00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,010
is an asset and it's often one of the

00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,290
most valuable assets that any

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,700
organization has and so to be able to

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,360
free it up and allow

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,340
to be used and reused structured content

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,140
is the way to go with that and as a team

00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:06,750
we can all contribute to that

00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:09,720
tremendously so any questions there

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,970
there will be a buff tomorrow at 5:00

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,400
since we only had 30 minutes less than

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,920
30 minutes today so I'll be doing a buff

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,680
at 5 o'clock tomorrow so if there are

00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,600
questions you can come to that but we

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,860
still have a minute if anybody has

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:30,210
anything they'd like to ask

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:32,790
come up to the mic schema.org how are

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:37,110
the schemas integrated into Drupal how

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:40,050
do you make your terms in Drupal align

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,870
with what's in schema.org you there are

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,730
modules for microdata

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:46,950
there's a few different ways to do it

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,400
through JSON and other things so if you

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,860
if you look on Dido and look for

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:59,640
microdata you should be able to find

00:29:52,860 --> 00:30:02,130
some answers to that yes a quick

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,040
question on the ingredients and why you

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:07,590
didn't separate out the amount from the

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,140
actual ingredient right that's what I

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,060
was saying as I was doing it oh yes that

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,490
you would probably want to do that so

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,930
that was this an example of showing you

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,330
could you throw it all into a single

00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,340
field but yes I would recommend that the

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,290
amount and the type of ingredient and

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,880
the preparation for it chopped sliced

00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:31,590
whatever would all be separated out any

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,260
other questions great well thank you for

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,900
coming and again the buff is tomorrow at

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,490
5:00 and so anyone wants to talk about

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,270
their experience with structured content

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,270
I will be there

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,870
