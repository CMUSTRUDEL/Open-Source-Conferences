Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Drupal is Changing, Quickly: How and Why
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	It seems like as soon as Drupal 7 was released we were all hearing about how awesome Drupal 8 was going to be. Have you heard all the buzz about the new features being developed now for Drupal 9? No? That’s because they are being developed and added to Drupal 8. Now!



Besides introducing new technologies such as the Symfony Framework and new features such as out of the box content translation Drupal 8 has changed the way Drupal core is developed.

This session is to let you know about how those changes will affect you, no matter whether you are a site builder, module developer, business owner or anyone else involved with Drupal.  

Topics that will be covered:

Semantic Versioning: New features are now being added to Drupal in minor releases such as 8.3.0, 8.4.0, etc.

Scheduled Releases: You can now count on when those minor versions are released(with new features!)

Experimental Modules: new experimental modules have been added to core every minor release so far.

The Ideas Queue: This is where big ideas start that turn into the features you will have tomorrow

This session will help you:

Learn what features have already been added to Drupal 8 since its release

Find out where to keep track of new features

Learn what features will likely already be in core for your sites that will be developed a half year or a year from now

Learn how to support new features that you are excited about

Learn how to get involved with the discussion around new features

Learn how to propose new features for Drupal core

um this is Drupal 8 or Drupal is

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,629
changing quickly how and why so

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,580
hopefully you're here for that

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,650
or maybe you're here for the commerce

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,650
stuff and stay over appreciate that too

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,539
so I just actually I'm putting the

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,340
session the survey question here in case

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,890
I like cram for time at the end didn't

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,019
forget to remind you please take the

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,619
survey after this and find it on the

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:33,360
scheduled and you can take a survey let

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,670
them know how the session was so my name

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,430
is Ted Bowman I work at aqua at the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:47,250
office of the CTO octo and I'm Ted bow

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,620
on Twitter and drupal.org so what I do

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,110
as part of my work at octo I'm a core

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,329
developer working on decoupled and UX

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,579
experience for drupal 8

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,289
and i'm the maintainer of the setting

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,180
straight module DX that's experimental

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,470
core module and that's kind of why I one

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,960
reason I thought about doing this

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,610
session is because I I've sort of found

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,130
out some stuff about the whole release

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,270
process that I didn't know before and I

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,280
talked to other people and they also

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,360
didn't know before though I thought so I

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,549
thought there's probably a lot of people

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,430
who don't know this stuff and it's good

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,979
to know I'm working on the core rest

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,360
module

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,369
gabor is here I want to thank him for he

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,619
made I took some of his graphics from

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,880
previous slides actually and I saw a

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,220
session he did that was a core

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,630
conversation that related to this and

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,009
I'm sort of thinking this as a core

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,869
conversation for people who aren't

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:43,680
involved in core so who are you so how

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,259
many people here are say a developer how

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,880
many people are here at themer

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,119
how many people are like a site business

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,909
owner that uses Drupal okay so let's so

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,170
that how many people are acute

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,829
Rottweiler puppies now how many people

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,299
are totally new to Drupal ok so not that

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,329
many how many people are new to Drupal 8

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,520
or have a use Drupal yet ok cool

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,229
so a lot of people may be familiar with

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,239
Drupal but not so much necessarily

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,870
working in Drupal 8 yet or at least not

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,400
everybody

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,680
so let's talk about Drupal core

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,770
development cycles

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,780
please don't leave let's talk about why

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,260
Drupal core development cycles might

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,760
actually matter to you so there's a lot

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,569
of been a lot of big changes since

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,850
Drupal 7 and I'm not sure about the

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,920
Drupal sort of core real life release

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,709
cycles since before 205 because I got

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,190
involved with Drupal around the late

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,270
part of Drupal 5 and so for me from my

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,140
perspective there's been a lot of

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:50,860
changes since that time and which i

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,560
think is a good thing so we're going to

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:57,880
talk about release schedules supported

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,930
versions new features and what's up with

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:06,370
Drupal 9 so the release schedule before

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,950
Drupal 8 if we look at this so from

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,940
Drupal for Drupal 5 it took 8 months to

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:17,410
develop Drupal 5 to Drupal 6 took 13

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,030
months Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 took 25

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,620
months anybody want to guess if that's

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,630
going to go up or down for Drupal from

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:29,530
Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 49 months so you

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,700
know this is a definitely I think I you

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,549
know I wasn't involved with core

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,350
development in the Drupal 8 site or the

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,170
Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 cycle except just

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,920
really really in a small actually my

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,420
monitor is not I just noticed that is

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,150
not including the whole thing that I'm

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,900
saying you aren't seeing so bear with me

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,900
a second

00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:15,400
you're still not seeing everything I've

00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:15,400
seen you are not what's that okay

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,199
so those are my two options I feel like

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,259
this one is better no the other one's

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,930
better

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:39,099
yeah okay so yeah I will

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,050
above it says months from previous

00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,610
version so basically I think you get the

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,229
idea from the graph without seeing the

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,280
actual label that this is something we

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,280
probably don't want to continue

00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:53,020
so recently cycle pre Drupal 8 was there

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,110
really wasn't a release site there

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,940
wasn't a release schedule let's say no

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,919
guarantees it's you know it's ready what

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,419
it's ready which is good in a way that

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,650
you know not releasing software before

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:08,020
it's ready is a good thing but then you

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,840
know after the core was really thin you

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,630
have to play the contributing game where

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,250
you know Drupal 7s releasing you have to

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,169
wait for everything to all the

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,780
contributing it ready for Drupal 7

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,129
Drupal 8's released some of that

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,530
hopefully we're at the end of that cycle

00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,169
now we're waiting for stuff to get ready

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,990
from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 so we'll talk

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:36,940
about more about this later

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:39,039
Oh wrong way so which leads to Angie or

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,330
various people would you know flog posts

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,620
about when is stuff going to be ready

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,690
sort of trying to get the community

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,509
involved and let's get stuff ready for

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,759
the next version this is a Drupal 8 blog

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,430
post of similarly about like the status

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,830
of the top hundred modules for for

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,479
Drupal 8 are they ready or not so you

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,360
know why does this matter why is this

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,789
sort of graph not where we want to go in

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,949
the future you know basically the web

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,669
moves fast like web technologies and

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,710
moving fast we want to add you know

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,360
things that we see other websites or

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,330
other systems using we want to add to

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,690
Drupal or you know our customers or the

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,479
people who use Drupal expect that but

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,560
Drupal was moving slowly and a lot of it

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,639
was like you know core mu slowly

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
contributor a lot more innovation the

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,990
past was happening at Riv and obviously

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,990
a lot of innovation happens in contribs

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,820
on

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,550
so release schedule post Drupal 8 we

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:45,320
actually have scheduled releases every

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,490
six months so let's look at that you

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,680
know we've we're already doing the

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,919
schedule releases eight point zero point

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,970
zero came out and November 2015 and we

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,250
have in April 2016 eight point one point

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,820
zero eight point two came out in October

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,680
5th 2016 and then just recently eight

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,240
point three point zero came out so this

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,400
is something that's happening and it has

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,229
been happening and we've been hitting

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,830
pretty good the Drupal community has

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:15,680
been you know getting these roughly on

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,360
the six-month mark there so the current

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,820
versions right now for Drupal are seven

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,460
point five four and seven or eight point

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,460
three one so you'll notice a little

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,740
difference here is we have this you know

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,160
just two portions of the versioning

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,259
system and seven but three in eight

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,169
point in the eight so what's up with

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,460
this last part here this is semantic

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:40,400
versioning it's a software release

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:44,900
numbering system often called Cimber and

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,030
it deals with the public API so we have

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,580
eight being our major version three

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,490
being minor and one is the patch release

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,349
so this is what is out there now so this

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,650
is where there's bug fixes security

00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,599
fixes so as go along you see problems in

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,560
Drupal core they get fixed they get

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,419
added in the patch releases Drupal the

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,509
major version is where you have backward

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,150
compatibility changes going up back

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,580
breaking backwards compatibility changes

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,000
that happen so obviously like Drupal 7

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,250
came in in Drupal 8 and obviously you

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,530
can't run the same modules that might be

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,440
different somewhat for Drupal 9 but the

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:29,210
idea is you shouldn't really have to

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:37,430
think too much about contribs in the

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:39,140
middle but in this minor versions here

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,659
is where we can add features without

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,060
backwards compatibility breaking changes

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,130
so trees talk today about a lot of

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,290
experimental modules

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,700
this is where in the minor releases you

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,970
can look at the release notes and say oh

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,920
this you know there's a new module added

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,240
or a modules move from certain like

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,330
alpha to beta so let's look more about

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:08,390
that so every six months we have these

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:09,950
releases and then 8.0 comes out then 8.1

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,070
and then eight point two eight point

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,600
zero point three and then eight at six

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,610
months later about eight point one point

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,410
zero will come out and then we'll go

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,220
through the same process there and then

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,470
move over here in the same process so an

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,390
important thing to know is so this we

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,060
have our minor patch patch release minor

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,500
patch patch patch patch patch at some

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,000
point we six months later we have

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,370
another minor impact so this you'll see

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,910
this cycle going on throughout the

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,440
Drupal eight release cycle but then we

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,480
have this minor release quality

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,150
assurance time so since we're going to

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,170
be adding potentially new features a lot

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,200
of it's going to be an experimental

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,280
modules that's but that's not exclusive

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,720
that it's going to be an experimental

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,820
modules is eight point three or every

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,890
time you have a three you have eight X

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,890
zero release there's going to be a beta

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,020
and then an RC so for example a three

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,990
came out there was an alpha on February

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,650
first and then a beta one four eight

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,170
three zero on February 22nd and then a

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,600
release candidate and then finally eight

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,230
point three point zero so you know if

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,850
you have a site and it's running on

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,260
Drupal 8 and you think well I see some

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,860
new stuff coming out you'll probably

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,080
want to test your site you know

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,460
especially when the RC comes out if you

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,320
have a development workflow where you

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,100
can actually split off and and if you

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,230
know make a new environment it might be

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,040
a good idea to test against the next

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:43,910
minor release version there and also

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,060
supported version so we get the support

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,270
on these minor releases but then when we

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,430
move to eight point zero point one then

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,890
we're not going to have support on the

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,560
old version so it's basically I mean if

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,700
I it would make more sense if we flatten

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,460
this out because it's really

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,740
line going down that you basically don't

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,110
want to be on those old versions you

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,850
want to update the sites and because you

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,890
know we're trying to keep backwards

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,520
compatibility breaking changes out of

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:16,160
this cycle here you really want to be

00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,320
keeping up with that there was actually

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,870
a security release last week I think

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,930
that was against the eight/three branch

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,940
that's why a 3.1 came out and there was

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,710
a because it was such a potential

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,080
security problem there was a patch

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,460
against the 8.2 but that's not I think

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,980
usually how it's going to happen and

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,460
also because it was just a three it just

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:41,900
come out so if you're running eight

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,610
point one point ten oh no you know

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,010
you're not you know on a supported

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:51,140
version of Drupal so you want to update

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:55,130
your site now I'll wait okay so let's

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,290
talk about new core features new

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,950
features are exciting potentially scary

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,860
you know bugs and new features so new

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,440
features before Drupal 8 usually for

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,160
most part mint went around with major

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,950
releases so Drupal 6 and for instance

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,520
added the drag-and-drop interface the

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:19,670
update status module Drupal 7 added

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,370
custom fields what used to be C CK the

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:27,230
overlay module image styles and then

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,000
Drupal 8 that 49 month between versions

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,950
actually we hope we got a whole lot for

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,900
that you know views content and

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,080
configuration translation configuration

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,640
management CK editor so a whole bunch of

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,050
good stuff obviously happened within

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,480
those 49 months so new features

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,960
obviously you know new bugs possibly new

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,540
security holes so new features in Drupal

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,620
8 we've introduced the idea of

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,450
experimental modules so experimental

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,130
modules they're not yet stable but

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,350
they're included in core you'll get a

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,840
warning when you turn them on say do not

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,170
run them in production and they also

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,680
have their own release cycle that is in

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,760
sort of they will be marked in these

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,740
alpha beta release candidates table

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,100
in the minor versions of Drupal but they

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,699
don't necessarily you could potentially

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:25,889
have something go in at beta at beta

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:27,839
state here they could be removed though

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,180
let's say we I mean the idea that

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,610
they're experimental is they're not done

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,529
they're not stable and potentially you

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,630
know people in court could work on them

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,310
and we think you know after actually

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,490
really doing this more we realized maybe

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,350
this is not a good match for core they

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,630
could be removed but there's the

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,250
possibility and I don't think anything's

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,010
actually been removed

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,660
experimental module in Drupal 8 yet to

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,550
say oh this is just not going to go into

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,060
core after it started the experiments of

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,519
process but potentially if it is removed

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,320
and you know some people really like it

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,540
it's just something that doesn't seem

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:13,649
like it's going to make it in core it

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:15,510
could go to contribute settings tray I'm

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,310
working on there's in line form errors

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,600
the my great UI content moderation

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,709
actually these on all of them these are

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,290
just sort of sampling I think this is

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:27,420
actually the only beta level

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,779
experimental module in Drupal 8 3 than

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,850
migrate module and then we have big pipe

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,319
module which is no longer experimental

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,300
module but it did go through that

00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:40,290
process it was an experimental module

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,730
and then made it to stable so I haven't

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,649
tried this but I'm assuming you turn on

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,449
big tight now you will not get a warning

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,610
that says this is experimental module

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,010
you know eight to you would have got

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,860
that so feel free to turn that on in

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,930
production now trees gave a demo it's

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,790
really you know awesome a great

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:01,380
improvement for you users so

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,589
experimental modules again are not

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,209
stable do not run them in production but

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,560
you're probably thinking oh really can I

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,870
run them in production I probably can

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,600
run them in production right

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,339
no so actually I just I got rid of my

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,990
last slide that was in this and I had

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,420
taken a picture this morning as I go

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,630
swap this out because it's awesome you

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,550
know

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,940
experimental module advisory do not you

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,710
know do not use in production so

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,190
you know potential security problems

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,870
potential data loss you know people have

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,670
asked me like okay if I really shouldn't

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,730
use them duction what's the point of

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,710
them being in court you know one I mean

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,990
one thing is a lot of people when

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,670
they're making sites it's like a

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:46,370
multi-month you know half year-long

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,200
process so it's really you know you may

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,820
want to work with the settings tray

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,210
module in your site if you're developing

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:57,350
a site that is really not going to be

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:59,090
production ready until 2018 so

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,500
oftentimes you're developing a site

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,450
that's going to be a live site in

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,830
production it's really important and you

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,900
wouldn't want data loss you wouldn't

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,430
want security holes but this site is

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,060
only developers are working on it right

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,160
now it's not live to the world so let's

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,560
say maybe you have an idea for something

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,940
you would like to get into Drupal core

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,050
there is a project called the Drupal

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,870
core ideas project and this is like a

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:29,120
like a module page or a theme page it

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:32,000
has and issue my less my slide or here

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,400
it has an issue queue you can you can

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,120
propose an issue it can go through the

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:43,850
whole like needs work RTB see reviewed

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:46,310
and tested by community so the idea is

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,930
that we don't you could just add

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,000
something to core and a lot of things

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,350
that aren't like so big ideas don't

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,030
necessarily have to go through the issue

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,350
queue but if you had a big idea for

00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,870
something in core you could spend like a

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,090
month writing code for it and then you

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,030
could have the patch writing and post it

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,830
out on the Drupal core issue queue and

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,839
then maybe everybody will say you know

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,370
hey this is a really bad idea or hey a

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,589
bunch of people been working on this

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,319
that you didn't know about and we're

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,579
already doing this somewhere else so the

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,030
idea is you posted out to the issue

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,209
queue it can sort of get backing behind

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,480
it can get a lot of plan planning before

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,740
you actually go and start writing code

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,230
because a lot of you know in our day

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,670
jobs we probably don't just get a client

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,710
and then to start writing code for them

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,390
immediately you know we see what they

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,870
actually need what features actually

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,120
make sense so this is the issue queue

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,090
that's the wrong direction so example

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,920
ideas or these are issues that are

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,030
actually out on the issue queue right

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:51,360
now the media initiatives essentials

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:53,400
out-of-the-box experience initiative one

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,250
idea is to remove the ban module from

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,270
core and one idea is to put pathauto in

00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,760
course so these aren't things

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,830
necessarily that are going to happen but

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,140
these are things that are ideas in the

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,000
issue queue and right now people are

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,200
debating the merits of these things so

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,330
if you have a you know a really strong

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,430
opinion about maybe I love the ban

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,310
module don't take it out of core you

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,380
might want to you know go in and go into

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,880
that issue if you think path path Auto

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,220
is like oh my god that should have been

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,450
in core like five years ago you might

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,160
want to weigh in on that issue so the

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,260
idea is on the issue queue we would

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,440
somebody who come in as an idea might

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,850
build a prototype it does not have to be

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,980
Drupal code it doesn't necessarily even

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,890
have to be code it could be like a UX

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,350
mock-up but there'd be a plan around

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,750
that and you'd sort of go in that cycle

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,450
until you get sign-off and people in and

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,310
it goes from reviewed tested community

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,860
so I think fixed or maybe it would move

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,320
over to the Drupal core Ishika but

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,820
basically before you start writing

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,550
Drupal code you would go through this

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,910
process but then it get approved and

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:08,550
then you go over to the Drupal suq build

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:10,740
and happiness so why ideas and not code

00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:14,130
right away to get buy-in from maintainer

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,470
xand committers plan before the

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,240
implementation and maybe you want to

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,240
focus on UX before you actually start

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,890
writing Drupal code and a number of

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,120
other reasons probably I'm not thinking

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,910
of so how can you help you can support

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,650
new features you could help with

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,220
existing experimental modules that are

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:37,110
in the Drupal core issue queue UX and

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,460
testing and planning for stuff in the

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,390
ideas queue you could promote existing

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,340
experimental modules write blog posts

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,530
about it do tutorials about how to use

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,130
them of course with the caveat that

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,750
saying they're experimental

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,980
you could sponsor Sprint's and

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,630
developers who are working on

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,930
experimental modules or in other

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,640
initiatives and usually this slide is

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,620
for the end but I just wanted to promote

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,540
this slide now this which actually I'm

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,120
almost at the end join us for the

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,680
contribution Sprint's because I know

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,060
I'll be working on the settings frame

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,320
module I'm sure a lot of other people

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,780
will be working on some of these

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,820
experimental modules so you don't

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,620
necessarily have to code a lot you know

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,870
pretty much if you're interested in

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,070
helping out show up either if you're

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,420
interested in out helping out

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,130
pacifically with the stuff that i'm

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:29,150
talking about or in general Drupal core

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:31,430
or contribute all nine drupal nine is

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:36,050
basically going to be removing Drupal

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:38,360
eight deprecated code so it could be

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,280
almost identical to the last release of

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,710
Drupal eight

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,360
so what's that mean so potentially

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,100
modules could be compatible with both

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,430
Drupal eight and Drupal nine if they're

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,020
not using any Drupal 8 compatible

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:55,220
deprecated code that same code

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:57,470
potentially run on a Drupal 9 site it

00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,450
also means that we probably won't be

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,930
needing to do a complete site rebuild

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,540
between Drupal 8 and Drupal 9 because if

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,400
you have your contributor new custom

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,230
code aren't using deprecated code you

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,450
could pretty much have the same site

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,940
working Drupal 9 this is a ways off so

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,300
we'll see but that for my that seems

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,490
like that's a possibility the other

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,800
thing I think that it means is don't

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,510
wait for Drupal 9 so I know when Drupal

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,240
8 came out I talk to a lot of people and

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,220
they're thinking you know Drupal core 2

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,670
major versions are supported at a time

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,500
so I have a Drupal 7 site and I don't

00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,630
want to build on Drupal 8 and then

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,780
Drupal 9 come out and then I'm due to

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,970
major rebuilds because the 8 to 9

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,430
potentially will not be a major rebuild

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:47,210
there might be incentive now to not wait

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:50,060
for Drupal 8 so not skip 8 and basically

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,190
build on Drupal 8 now and when Drupal 9

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,390
comes along it won't be the same pain

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,590
that 7 to 8 might have been for you

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,090
other possibilities these are just

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,130
things I'm thinking of not really other

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,169
that I've heard other places is you

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,419
could have kind of

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,009
Billy badges so you could have we could

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:07,480
have an automated system on on

00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:09,999
drupal.org that says you know this

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,289
module is compatible with Drupal 9 and

00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:15,549
we would know that because it's not

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,129
using any deprecated code modules tested

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:19,840
pre Drupal 9 so we could have Drupal 9

00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,210
coming out and we could actually start

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,369
to run tests on all contributed modules

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,609
against Drupal 9 to see if they fail or

00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:31,090
not we could have automatic

00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:32,499
compatibility testing another thing I

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,080
thought is we could have address command

00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:37,539
that says drush upgrade test core 9 say

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,639
hey Drupal 9 is coming check to see if

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:42,039
my site uses any deprecated code that

00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:43,570
will not be available in Drupal 9 this

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,369
it doesn't exist I just thought you know

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:50,139
it's an idea and the contributing game

00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:52,090
I'm not sure if it will be totally gone

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:55,299
but it could be a whole lot better

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,159
because you know every contributor does

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:00,279
not have to rewrite their code for

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,700
Drupal for Drupal 9 so potentially if

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,989
you're keeping up and I know I've been a

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,940
contributor in the past I know it's hard

00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:09,309
to do this but potentially if you're

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,899
keeping up and you can make sure that

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,460
you're not using any of that deprecated

00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,710
code that's currently and will be in the

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,669
future and Drupal 8 then your module

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,950
potential eulogy just ready for Drupal 9

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:22,629
I think we have five minutes I'm just

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,289
going to remind you about the survey

00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:28,769
again if the next speakers here and I

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:37,980
should be gone let me know but otherwise

00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:37,980
questions five minutes questions yep

00:23:41,670 --> 00:24:01,000
yep yeah so a lot of stuff potentially a

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,740
lot of things it's not changed like the

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,150
media stuff going in to Drupal 8 it's

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,160
potentially I think going in as the

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,680
media entity being stable but like the

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:18,540
media browser being experimental and

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:20,590
those things living contribute I dia of

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,980
innovation and contribute and moving the

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,750
core is not gone with this idea there

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:31,080
have been some some things I think like

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:32,530
in line in line form errors that have

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:39,160
did not

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:41,350
I don't think lives in contribs in stuff

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,300
that it's gone into core and without

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,970
necessarily being can contribute just

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,800
went in in major cycles and now with

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,290
semantic versioning we have the ability

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,540
to put it in and minor cycles so I don't

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,810
think I mean I agree that I hope

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:59,800
innovation hat keeps happening in trib

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:02,980
but it's not it's not like we never and

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,170
I'm pretty new to Drupal core develop so

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,150
I I can't say this for sure but it's not

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,640
been that we that things haven't been

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:13,930
added to Drupal core without going to

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,290
contribute on major releases and now it

00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:19,290
can possibly happen on minor releases

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,290
yep

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,950
yep I guess it sounds like that plan

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,590
works great for stuff that is in the

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,809
earlier minor version Jeff but if

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:52,240
something gets deprecated in like the

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:55,990
last minor or major release yeah but I

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,960
think I think right now the idea is that

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,940
I mean basically like if you plan to

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,150
keep it over and Drupal 9 then by

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,059
definition is not deprecated so I think

00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,100
that would be a more indecision of we

00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:12,669
can't deprecated everything or it would

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,860
be by definition a rebuild so I think

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:17,289
it's more just like a be careful what we

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,460
deprecated and don't just like go

00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,440
through and just like let's just mark

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,900
everything deprecated before Drupal 9 so

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,720
we can rebuild Drupal 8 so through pool

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,270
9 can be a total rebuild again but yeah

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,740
I see what you mean it would be nice but

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,799
then it's like you get into the point of

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,750
deprecated means deprecated and they're

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,510
going to be not like the major

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,039
reversions versions are where it's where

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,049
it's torn out and also I think just the

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,610
decision making process if you didn't

00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,630
have that cutoff to say this is when we

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:50,230
do it then yeah it would be hard yeah

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:54,250
just is oh I think it's on just to be

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:58,480
clear if I use a Drupal 8.0 module at

00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,559
8.9 it's not going to be broken I just

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,580
want to make sure I understand the

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,980
semantics that is that is the idea yeah

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,650
you sounded a little you know not yeah

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,720
so that is not so the API as far as the

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,039
API is concerned that is true but

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,799
there's a lot of things that are not

00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:18,039
covered in the API like say I think

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,610
render arrays or forms so if you have a

00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:23,289
module that relies on the form being a

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,809
particular way and it does a form alter

00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:29,350
and if if it can't do the form alter too

00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:31,040
in that way to work and then Drupal 8.8

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,920
that form changes

00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,750
then the contribs to update that I guess

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,730
more what we're saying is like the

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,530
application programming interface like

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,540
the internet object-oriented interface

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,190
mice's and stuff like that that's what

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,140
we sort of can guarantee you won't

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,500
change so there is actually a backwards

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:51,350
compatibility I'll put it on the session

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,450
notes that that goes into detail what's

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,970
covered and what's not covered so yeah

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,420
no it's not a like hard fast guarantee

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:04,240
that if somebody writes an eight point

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:08,600
zero zero module it will run an 8.9 9.0

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,470
