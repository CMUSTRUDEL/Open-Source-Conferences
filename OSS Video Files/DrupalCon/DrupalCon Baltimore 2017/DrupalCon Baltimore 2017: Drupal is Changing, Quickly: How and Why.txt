Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	It seems like as soon as Drupal 7 was released we were all hearing about how awesome Drupal 8 was going to be. Have you heard all the buzz about the new features being developed now for Drupal 9? No? That’s because they are being developed and added to Drupal 8. Now!



Besides introducing new technologies such as the Symfony Framework and new features such as out of the box content translation Drupal 8 has changed the way Drupal core is developed.

This session is to let you know about how those changes will affect you, no matter whether you are a site builder, module developer, business owner or anyone else involved with Drupal.  

Topics that will be covered:

Semantic Versioning: New features are now being added to Drupal in minor releases such as 8.3.0, 8.4.0, etc.

Scheduled Releases: You can now count on when those minor versions are released(with new features!)

Experimental Modules: new experimental modules have been added to core every minor release so far.

The Ideas Queue: This is where big ideas start that turn into the features you will have tomorrow

This session will help you:
