Description: 
	Beyond The .Com: Drupal’s new role in the Large Enterprise

In order to continue to grow your career with Drupal, it’s important to understand where the digital, web design and development marketplace is going - and where Drupal fits into it.  Who better to explore in this endeavor than those organizations who are trying to solve for the most complex digital, IT and marketing challenges on a global scale: The Large Enterprise.  This session is less about Gartner rankings and CMS comparisons, and more about you gaining an understanding how Drupal now fits into a global organization’s product roadmap in 2017 and beyond. After all, it’s not just an ECMS anymore!

This session is tailored to technology and digital strategy enthusiasts who love to see and hear exciting new Drupal use cases through the eyes of organizations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Travelport, Georgia Institute of Technology, NCR and Rinnai.  We will explore the primary challenges that the Large Enterprise is using Drupal to solve for, including:

Why multi-billion dollar organizations consider Drupal the long-term, global platform to support CRM, Digital Asset Management and Product Inventory Management Systems and the skill sets they look for to support the platform

How to spot and distill important new Drupal case studies in the wild

A look into Drupal’s integration with Intelligent Personal Assistants

Drupal’s new role in the Electronic Vehicle ecosystem

How to use Drupal as the “Golden Hammer” to build consensus among IT, Marketing and the C-Suite

The new web functionality that is in the strongest demand across multiple verticals

welcome again everyone my name is Josh

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,440
minor and I'm a vice president at media

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,500
current our commitment is to improve the

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,740
large enterprise for the good using

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,070
advanced digital strategy and Drupal

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,710
I've been in the business about 20 years

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,619
dating myself there but I remember being

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,869
in conference rooms like this trying to

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,270
sell through why it was important even

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,370
to have a website to begin with using

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,840
language like 24/7 access to content

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,050
cyberspace and things like that so to

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
come a long way born and raised right

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,030
down the road in Pennsylvania about 90

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,850
minutes from here graduated from Penn

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,629
State University and now I reside in

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,270
Atlanta with my wife and daughter Brooke

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,910
my passion point really is trying to

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,800
find the why behind large enterprise

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,989
project they're typically six hundred

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,549
thousand dollars plus so it's a big

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,159
investment for the organization it's

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,010
important to know what measurable impact

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,810
that has on the business so the data

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,600
that I'm presenting to you today is

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,030
taken from approximately thirty large

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,689
enterprise projects over the last two

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,270
years

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,630
I'm also very active and attending panel

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,189
discussions with IC marketing and

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,680
procurement professionals so there's a

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,810
lot of data I pulled from that and a lot

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,900
of survey data so I'll be presenting to

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,119
you as well and what I love about Drupal

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,079
comm really is it's all about the how we

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,960
come together during these few days to

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,399
share best practices and it's a really

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,140
really important time for all of us in

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
the community so you're already probably

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,829
doing this but please take the time to

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,369
meet new people and share information

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,969
about the projects you're working on we

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,649
have a booth on the trade floor meeting

00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,790
current has an after party tonight I'll

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,860
be here through Thursday if you want to

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,070
take a deep dive on any of this happy to

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,390
take you through it so the reason the

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,879
how is so important in the large

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,610
enterprises these projects are very very

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,850
very complex it takes an army just to

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,530
get a large enterprise project

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,830
off the ground you could get a green

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,750
light for a project in March and really

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,120
not even begin be able to begin work

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,950
until July based on a lot of the

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,100
procurement measures in place so we have

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,050
some things to share for you there and

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,660
we talked a lot about you know the three

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,410
C's of Drupal and leaning heavily on

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,110
core and contributing a lot of custom

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,610
code but that said all of our Drupal

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,550
projects in the large enterprise are

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,140
very custom in nature and if we don't

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,300
like that word let's just let's just

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,760
call them targeted but when it all comes

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,710
down to it you know the reason I've been

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,230
in this business for so long and the

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,760
reason I love attending Drupal con the

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,150
reason I love the Drupal community in

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,370
general is we helped shape the internet

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,190
all of us in this room and not a lot of

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,340
people can go to bed at night sharing

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,140
that you know same sentiment when people

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,480
ask me what we do or what I do at

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,550
cocktail parties that's exactly what I

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,590
say I helped shape the internet and then

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,790
they say well how do you do that let's

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,660
say well let me tell you about what a

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,670
product called Drupal and this is seems

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,170
to be a theme on the trade floor too if

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,210
you want to sit through a Pantheon demo

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,550
they have a t-shirt that says we make

00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,420
the Internet so clearly a lot of

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,810
influence everyone has in this room

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,340
regarding helping drive digital we drive

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,400
over 3,000 attendees to Drupal con

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,460
because of this statement so very very

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,190
exciting time to be in the business

00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,550
because you know that's kind of

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:53,660
important thing this is what happens in

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,180
an Internet minute in 2017 the folks

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,730
that put this graph together went to the

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,420
quarterly reports of all these companies

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,850
did the math down to 60 seconds and came

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,110
up with this pie chart so by the time

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,930
I'm done with the talk today there'll be

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:14,930
about a billion text messages sent

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:19,730
there'll be 210 million Google searches

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:24,919
and 3,000 Amazon echo spent just in the

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:26,639
next hour alone email 156 million email

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,330
sent per minute

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,319
for fun I ran the math on that and I

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,629
don't even know what that is

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,060
I tried to Google that number and if

00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,580
anyone can help me figure that out that

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,289
would be good because it doesn't even

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,500
look like math anymore begins to look

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:47,669
like physics so the Internet is very

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,159
much shaping the way we live work and

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:53,520
play and we're all part of it so there's

00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:55,800
a tremendous tremendous opportunity out

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,300
there for all of us to improve as

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,000
individuals and as companies in those

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:05,279
organizations and then there's this stat

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,289
given to me by my coworker Shelley

00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:12,090
Hutchins who's giving a chat on digital

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:17,310
buzz buzz buzz phrase later this

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,819
afternoon when I look at this I can go

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,189
both ways

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:24,599
who who thinks this is really good news

00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:28,460
yeah I mean I see a lot of good news in

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:30,990
the - but who thinks is very bad news

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,169
anyone want to volunteer why it is bad

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,169
news

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,810
yeah yeah I agree I thought I was not

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,380
contributing to the cause but then I

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:52,430
find myself texting my wife you know on

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,570
another story of the house bought my

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,790
daughter an iPhone 7 she's 7 I hope the

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,840
15% over here is the you know the

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,430
relationship side of what we do but it's

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,770
just it's information that we have to

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,490
face head-on and in order for us to

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:12,680
succeed the takeaway today is we have to

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,900
stretch it with the large enterprise be

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,130
ready for the what's new next and as a

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,370
community we need to constantly

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,170
constantly evolve because bad things

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,120
happen when you don't

00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:28,490
Kodak global market leader almost two

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,290
hundred thousand employees vast majority

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,510
of the market share failed the course

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,620
correct and now they're out of business

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,080
hate talking about this long because I

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,370
was a big blockbuster fan but they also

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,260
didn't see the dark clouds rolling in

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,950
and now they're they're not relevant

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,110
anymore and it's not always about the

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,200
entire business failing sometimes it's

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,140
just a major restructuring in the

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,200
organization reduction in force or

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,380
companies hands being tied and not being

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,240
able to innovate and I can't tell you

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,070
how many meetings I've been in over the

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,200
last two years where high-level

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,810
executives in corporations are saying

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,590
we're waiting for the market to turn or

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,780
we're hoping this goes our way waiting

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,550
and hoping are not strategies folks if

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,520
you find yourself using those words

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,000
please please please look to thinking

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,820
more out of the box and organizations

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,600
that are finding a way to innovate and

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:36,020
keep that front of mine the NFL Draft is

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,300
in a couple days I'm a big NFL fan or

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,910
streaming game on Twitter now is anyone

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,000
know why that is I forget well there

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,350
tries to

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,800
the early 20 min 20 market and those

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,080
kids are sitting from a television on

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,600
Sunday in the lazy chair with remote

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,840
control they're on their mobile devices

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:05,660
so the NFL is going to wear that new

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:09,450
audience is they are planning to remove

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,300
advertisements during games that to me

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,970
feels like the Jerry Maguire letter

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,500
we're sitting up one night and take it

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,470
straight for the game and great for you

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,630
and great for everybody but at lands on

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,390
the wrong sea level seafoods death and

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,450
you could be out of a job

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:29,250
but that very very very much is part of

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,620
their business strategy they're not

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,560
taking revenue out they're just making a

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,360
property more valuable I mean there's

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,780
not as much space there you can offer

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,840
more for it and if the audience that

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,000
you're going after isn't engaged then

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,190
your counter for Luckett or trying to do

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,020
I mean I just don't think it would be

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,630
too hard to sell Super Bowl ads I mean I

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,830
would think there'd be a rush of people

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,050
coming into that space because of the

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,830
limited real estate so they're changing

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:03,650
their revenue model to make the game a

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,650
lot better for their target audiences

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,610
same game I was watching they're now

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,260
pulling data on how long it takes for

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,410
someone to attack the quarterback and

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,290
they rank them by individuals in real

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,210
time so got me thinking what data out

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,670
there are we sitting on top of that

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,700
we're not currently using how do we go

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,980
about getting it and then where could it

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,670
be a value outside of of where it's

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:34,050
currently being used

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:36,839
anybody use lyft or uber yep so this is

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,400
making grounds on uber and one reason is

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,550
they're constantly innovating constantly

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,720
evolving they now go into partnership

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,360
with General Motors where if they do 75

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,520
rides or more a week they get their car

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,630
for free and they can use that for

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,450
personal use

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,670
so if lyft is sitting back saying let's

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,779
get more drivers on the road that's a

00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,910
good way to do it

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,730
also not everyone has the vehicle that's

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,819
appropriate for left so they're stuck

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,230
this is a good way of solving those

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:12,110
problems and it basically opens up the

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,160
market for more people to participate

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,870
therefore your ride gets there quicker

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,660
and this is all of a sudden moving ahead

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,360
of the market something grows this

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,519
mustache thing is pretty cool if you're

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,379
at a big venue or a concert and it's

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,339
dark and you need to find your ride that

00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:30,389
solves for that

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,279
it also shows your name when it pulls up

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,529
says hello diem so you know which car is

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,480
yours so they're never sitting stagnant

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,279
saying all right we got we got the

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,540
platform built exactly the way we want

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,480
it they're always looking at where the

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,069
next DS need is and where the next

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:49,199
opportunity is and that's a really good

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:52,910
timing for us in the triple space

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:56,970
because it's now in the right quadrant

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,769
for the large enterprise the Gartner

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,449
Magic Quadrant is where the large

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,009
enterprise goes to pick their short list

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,769
of what technologies they're going to

00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:07,920
use it's where they trust good solutions

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:12,029
are and actually has been climbing that

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,059
ladder as a platform but all of us are

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,309
responsible for the success of Drupal

00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,139
every project we touch is impacting an

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,870
individual as impacting an organization

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,990
so we share in this success it's ranked

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,180
with aqua but we share in the success

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,120
aqua is partner network got a 5 out of 5

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,699
from Forrester so all the industry

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,379
insiders are looking to Drupal and the

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,769
partner and the development community as

00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,759
the go-to solution for web architecture

00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,379
and that is so huge because the future

00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,720
for digital is so bright so we are

00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,220
sitting exactly where we need to be and

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,139
we just need to make sure that we're

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,540
pushing forward and we got some

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:56,459
suggestions for that making good headway

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,910
more and more of the Fortune 500

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:02,370
organizations using Drupal 42% increase

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,850
in Drupal adoption over the last two

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,610
years

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,050
escape was provided by John Anouk John

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,050
are you in the audience Oh

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,940
um all this to say that we're heading in

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,740
the right direction and we just need to

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:22,070
keep pushing forward so what does

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,210
evolution mean to me it means looking at

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,600
things differently

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:29,570
I showed this stat earlier the evolution

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,310
of the large enterprise of Drupal at all

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,710
just doesn't come down to the platform

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:37,040
there's evolution occurring in all of

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,690
these areas in how people are putting

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,090
together the business case to adopt

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,000
Drupal how people are demoing Drupal for

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,960
the c-suite how you build consensus in

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,540
an organization

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,190
why is IT and marketing still on two

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,050
sides of the fence why can't they play

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,660
nicely together in the same sandbox

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:57,230
there's some progress being made there

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,180
how to properly deliver a project

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,920
through development methodologies what

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,020
was a really good development

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,390
methodology two years ago all of a

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,290
sudden isn't as good with agile and how

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:11,210
we're probably progressing there so

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,060
change is happening all around us it's

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,560
affecting every single area of the

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:19,190
project it's important that we change

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:25,630
our paradigm and where that really

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:29,750
struck me was I was at a conference in

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,900
New York called the sorry went backwards

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,900
there

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,459
the digital market event of the year the

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,949
Salesforce connections conference within

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:44,230
New York if you've ever been a featured

00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:46,569
speaker for Salesforce it's pretty

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,470
incredible what they do pick you up at

00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:49,720
the airport

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,120
get to your room on Times Square all

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,190
expenses paid and all the things they do

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,920
is they take you out to dinner at a nice

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,019
restaurant and we were sharing stories

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,329
on where each other's businesses are

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,970
moving forward and I always looked at

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:07,149
Salesforce pretty much as a sales guys

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,829
tool you know they love calls and emails

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:12,970
and that's how they're tracking their

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:14,339
pipeline for the business but I was as I

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,300
was talking to her at dinner that night

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,350
she said something that was really

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,240
really profound

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,709
she said what we're trying to solve for

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,930
as a company is what happens when we get

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:29,500
every single sales person on the planet

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,779
using our software then where do we go

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,180
so going back to that list of Fortune

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:37,149
500 companies what happens when all of

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,399
those organizations get on to Drupal are

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,560
there comms on the drupal where do we

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,920
take the technology within their

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:49,569
organization so they went from you know

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:53,620
just a tool for salespeople to this

00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:55,709
that's their product menu and they're

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,889
now serving up platforms across multiple

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:02,290
multiple articles so a good use case for

00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,689
how to move left and right so I came

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,509
back from that conference stumbled upon

00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:10,149
this slide and you know because we're in

00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:12,220
the website business you know this is

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,500
kind of scary you know what happens when

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,310
you know the dot-com is no longer the

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,459
spot to go to for a large enterprise

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,920
what happens is a large enterprise isn't

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,779
tracking the right KPIs for their

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,519
website and they're just not willing to

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,560
invest in it anymore

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,089
what does that happen to you working on

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,189
the project what does that happen to you

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,149
as an agency who sold it in what does

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:37,180
that happen to you as an organization

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,920
residual its infrastructure so the

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,370
lightbulb just kind of went off around

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,709
all right

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,010
we've got to start pushing Drupal deeper

00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,500
and past just a public-facing calm web

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,100
site

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,480
we're making a lot of progress there you

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,160
learn a lot about some cool projects

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,220
here at the con but a few use cases

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,520
universities have 1500 plus URLs on

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,860
campus they've got 12 different systems

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,750
they're all disconnected I think one of

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,090
the reasons Drupal's been so popular in

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,510
that space is because of the opportunity

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,700
to centralize all that large enterprises

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,530
have 300 plus digital assets that

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,940
they're responsible for they're creating

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,520
a single point of entry why are we

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,020
sending customers to a support portal

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,610
why are we sending investors to an

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,760
investor portal aren't they all go into

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,410
one spot and you know true point

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,950
government me on the tree site this

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,290
morning

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,700
thought I heard him right saying that

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,290
the city of San Francisco said every

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,870
website that they build has to be in

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,080
Drupal 8 what pops in my head was do

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,370
they know how to define website are they

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,050
only thinking what the public could see

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,900
are they thinking about it in terms of

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,000
what infrastructure they're running and

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,820
with with how government has adopted

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,340
Drupal there's just so much opportunity

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,390
for where they can take that I mean

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,330
occurred who I work for

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,520
half of our projects last year for the

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,650
large enterprise were not at all related

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,620
to their primary comm there were in

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:08,020
other areas so massive massive market

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,020
beyond just the the dot-com web property

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,110
so how do we evolve you know how do we

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,360
move forward the line I like to use is

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,270
you know know where the puck is going

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,220
and then skate to it and the way you

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,189
find that out is you ask questions I

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,720
mentioned earlier you know my passion

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,700
point is making sure and uncovering the

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,710
why around all these large enterprise

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,910
projects well we note that and when

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,350
you're writing that down over a period

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,890
of two years you can start seeing trends

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,950
and another way to do that is just ask

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,970
you know do some surveys and we ran one

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,990
for 50 plus a large enterprise

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,310
executives across IT and marketing and

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,710
put this survey out here I'll give you a

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,240
couple minutes to digest that and what

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,940
we were asking them it was it was all

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,470
over the board from the hot topics

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,370
around moving from

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:04,520
and cloud you know how to develop a

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,530
proper way to support your platform how

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,110
to develop a product roadmap the

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,110
importance of web accessibility in our

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,980
market is how you go about you know

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,240
understanding the value of what an

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,260
open-source product looks like

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,050
and then cybersecurity which is top of

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,540
mind and then of course what the

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:27,350
understanding of an are live an improved

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:30,280
user experience would be and the clear

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,900
winner wasn't even close with

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,730
understanding the ROI of improved user

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:41,510
experience so all eyes are on UX and

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,580
we've got to find where Drupal and UX

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:47,630
cross paths all of our current KPIs are

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,730
commonly leaning in that direction

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,860
anyway I don't know about how you're

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,750
measuring your projects like mobile

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,720
scores and conversion rates in session

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,630
times balance rate all of these common

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,060
KPIs are directly tied to user

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,980
experience so again we have to find a

00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:08,720
way where that intersection point is

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,250
with Drupal 80% of users that come to a

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,910
website have a bad experience and not

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,450
coming back

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,890
so you got one really good shot to make

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,260
sure you achieve that objective

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:24,200
so as we look at where that intersection

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,480
point is between Drupal and improved UX

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,750
knowing that the industry is craving

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:34,960
that I took a look at kind of how far

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:41,390
the technology came and you know back in

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:46,160
1998 it was all HTML and $85 for an HTML

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:48,320
page all the navigation was at left we

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,580
had a term called flyouts when I'm in

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,240
the navigation at the tops got a

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,980
drop-down and you know it wasn't real

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,000
sophisticated at all but we were just

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,570
starting to build what a website was has

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,450
anyone ever heard of archive.org they're

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,670
cool websites still out there doing a

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,980
good job at making sports earlier this

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,240
was ESPN

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:16,290
calm in January 25th 1999 that trustee

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:21,309
left navigation menu

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:23,080
and here's espn.com today but it's

00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:25,840
fascinating you can spend hours on that

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,730
tool seeing the befores and afters and

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,690
you can use it in your own organization

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,340
if you want to make a really strong

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:38,740
business case on how far that you can

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:41,980
help before you come so the the roadmap

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,690
that Troopa has come across in the u.s.

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,770
to me has been fascinating and it's been

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,100
driven by responding to the needs of the

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:55,990
market and our fantastic contributed

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:58,750
community so 2000 2007 2008 you know

00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,190
video starting to come around we're

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,460
looking at more sophisticated account

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:06,970
management personalizations starting to

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:10,990
happen a little bit you know precursor

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:13,240
for mobile 2014 responsive is in full

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,970
bloom as typically tied and always tied

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,940
to us content marketing starts to happen

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,919
all right what happens when we

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,480
understand what the visitors preferences

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,809
are how do we make sure we keep putting

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,790
that back to them marketing automation

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:30,820
sprung up and then decoupled an area

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,340
where we spend a lot of our time was an

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,440
absolute game changer for the

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,250
marketplace in keeping Troopa relevant

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,580
in those us conversations localization

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,520
critically important to UX and Drupal's

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,600
made fantastic strides there so if we

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,290
looked at 2017 you know web

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,179
accessibility is the front of mine

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,460
personalization is in full bloom

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,990
products like lift are starting could be

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,090
used and then the markets we can you

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,220
know understand the value of that but a

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,610
big one is change management and just

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:09,370
the ability to you know build consensus

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,919
within an organization to have them let

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:17,160
go of what they used to do and move

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,160
forward with what they need to do

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:25,620
so where does that take us next well all

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,990
the angular reacts front-end tools

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,260
there's more and more of those occurring

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,020
on Drupal project that's really really

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,480
important because that UX is being done

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,460
on sites that aren't running on Drupal

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,980
so we need to keep pace with them and

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,450
then we've got to think you know 20 20

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,990
20 20 to 20 24 20 26 where are we going

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,460
to go next I think part of that is

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,640
knowing the difference between user

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,160
experience and design and then making

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,450
sure we're all carrying that torch

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,850
forward so when I think of UX I'm not

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,220
just thinking about customers you know

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm thinking about employees you know

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,510
what's their day-to-day like what sort

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,330
of systems are they working on that they

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,880
are really pulling their hair out about

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,000
but for whatever reason aren't talking

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,070
up what about potential employees the

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,370
people you're trying to recruit how easy

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,900
is it for them to engage with your

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,450
company to learn about your company to

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,740
be employed with your company the

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,290
c-suite I mentioned universities earlier

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,930
you know a lot of the senior leadership

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,550
there didn't come up in the same

00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,570
generation where all this you know

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:45,420
digital new experience is happening so

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,460
when you mention things like CRM or UX

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,770
or all the terms that we use you know it

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:54,120
sounds Greek to them we've got to find a

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:56,760
way to put it in their terms and that's

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,590
very much a user experience for the

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,120
c-suite maybe they need to see a demo

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,090
maybe they need to see a mock-up you

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,370
just never know and then of course on a

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,850
global scale need to start looking at

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:11,850
how we're localizing content and then

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,440
how we're addressing our digital web

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:19,670
accessibility both externally and

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:22,680
internally so here's some trends that

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:25,680
that I've been seeing over the last two

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,890
years over engineering is surveying the

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,800
ability to move forward so if you've got

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,930
a big

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,630
some stack and there's your really Wed

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,790
to it for one reason or another and you

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,860
want to quickly respond to a new UX

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:44,300
trend in the marketplace and it's just

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:48,530
not not easy to do so jiffy lubes

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:52,370
project last year had a rule big custom

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,660
staff but they liked the tools that they

00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,390
were using on the front end

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,010
they were very performant so the

00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,420
recommendation there is not to come into

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,550
the room and say alright everything

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,830
you've done is terrible we can't reuse

00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,870
any of it so you have to adopt this new

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:10,190
thing because that wouldn't win over

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:13,250
well the solution was keeping what they

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,020
have that was working be coupling Drupal

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,680
to take advantage of that and that was a

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,840
trip away PHP 7 project and then using

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,780
the API that we have available to

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,900
integrate all the different systems that

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,760
were that we're plugging into that

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,440
website that's real important if you're

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,180
trying to sell in a project we're trying

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,740
to move the marketplace forward we've

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:38,930
got to be smart the solutions that we're

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:41,420
putting forth this one kind of jumped

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,790
off the page for me too I hear a lot

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,370
that global strategies importance on

00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,740
everyone's product roadmap but it still

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,300
feels like a face to let's get phase one

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,370
done and then phase two let's try to

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,300
translate it but the lion's share of the

00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:00,020
global market is not in English and 73%

00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,880
actually require that local US and as a

00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,000
result if you're localizing your site

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:09,050
ROI is really going through the roof but

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,240
this still is seen as a nice to have and

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:17,870
it can no longer be working towards

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,000
centralizing on one platform for all

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,280
digital assets that's what people want

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,170
to do but if you're a six billion dollar

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,630
company with two hundred thousand

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,090
employees how big of a project does that

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,640
feel like huge absolutely huge

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,830
we're probably it's you know paralysis

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,220
by analysis you just don't know where to

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:40,490
start and it's costing people by not

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,500
moving in that direction here's an

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,430
example of what centralizing on a

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,630
platform for

00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:49,010
University could look like so say and

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,670
most universities have a big donation

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:54,890
goal and you know obviously they have

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,840
donors that you know are recent grads

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,250
buying the branded credit card and they

00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,410
have ones that are over a million

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,350
clearly they want to pull in you know

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,820
the million dollar donors they know that

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,650
profile they've been working really

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,970
really hard to figure out what that

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:13,670
profile is what if through the student

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,330
application process or through the

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,250
student coursework you could identify

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:22,190
what those data points are that map to

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,950
that 1 million dollar profile and then

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,380
start that conversation earlier so if

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,970
I'm a student at Penn State University

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,250
and I'm seeing where donations are

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,320
helping me out while I'm there it's a

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,010
lot easier to get my support after I

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,600
graduate I graduate and I just paid you

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,490
$40,000 and I'm working hard to pay that

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,830
back and the first email you send me is

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,360
by this credit card or send me you know

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,130
five hundred dollar check for duty

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,350
you're just disengaging at that point

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,030
but if you can show value along the way

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,130
specifically to those students who put

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,950
that profile that would be a very very

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:58,430
powerful thing but a lot of systems and

00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:03,020
interoperability have to happen for this

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:04,220
to easier to go on so baby steps are

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,530
important proof of concepts are

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,190
important but the opportunity is is all

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:13,190
around us so in many cases with these

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:16,970
big projects it's like herding cats one

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:20,300
way you can organize you know the large

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:23,150
enterprise across IP across marketing is

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,550
to do you know use Drupal 8 as a proof

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,640
of concept I mean it's not too hard to

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,710
spin up a new web property just to show

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,100
it working you know hey user can log-in

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,260
they're seeing this page the new VM is

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,660
making the local set up a lot easier to

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,970
do so it's not as painful on your

00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,740
development team and we're seeing across

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,960
the market especially with the large

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,810
enterprise once they can see it

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,180
regardless if it's you know two pages or

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,460
20 pages one piece of functionality or

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,260
100 piece of functionality far more

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,360
likely to get behind it

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,850
where if you're sitting in a room saying

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,250
yeah we can make it do this and we can

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,210
make it do that I mean that's a little

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,070
more difficult for someone to envision

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,870
we have a conversational interface pilot

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,769
at our booth that worked really really

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,440
well didn't take long at all to spin up

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,760
an Amazon echo POC that did a really

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,760
good job you know getting the

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:24,710
organization to adopt that latest and

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:28,760
greatest technology some other examples

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,649
are where to look for UX you know as an

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,799
organization there's a lot of corporate

00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:35,210
missions and culture objectives that are

00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,700
being put out there it's important to

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:41,090
look at how Drupal and Technology

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:44,840
supporting those constantly hearing

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:47,690
about look budgets are tight we're

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,549
looking for ways to run lean well how

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,850
many systems do you currently manage

00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:54,590
content where you have a different team

00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,909
posting a social and a different team

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,450
person to the website I mean how

00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:02,059
convoluted is that how would you benefit

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,970
from a centralized platform which one of

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,169
these systems could you retire and find

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,950
our alliance

00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:11,840
talk about the portals earlier it's

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:15,799
important to be able to a cost analysis

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,010
there and then hiring the Millennial

00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:23,179
market in demand but they're not going

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:26,750
to be too patient with an old clunky job

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:30,799
application we want to look at how easy

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:33,139
those things are from the inside out so

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,529
I have these little dollar signs there

00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:38,480
to remind me that there's ROI and

00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,549
investment opportunities across all of

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,500
these different opportunities so if

00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:44,299
you're not asking the questions if

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,760
you're not running the analysis again

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:50,299
you can continue to be stuck in the mud

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,409
for example a client called

00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:55,580
curtiss-wright that's an organization

00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:58,940
works with architects department and is

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:02,000
learn from the Wright brothers and their

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,919
CEO wanted to be one curtiss-wright

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
they have 9,000 employees across the

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,230
company so their big objective in that

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,179
year

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:13,280
was to you know become more increased

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:15,590
collaboration and become more of a 1:1

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,320
group and they didn't have a central hub

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:22,309
to do it so that made an internet a

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,690
really good strong solution now and put

00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:25,460
that together for them and now they're

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,200
adding more and more to it and finding

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,480
more and more efficiencies that came

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,270
from we've got a statement in our annual

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,100
report to an internet internet project

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:38,419
over the period of about six six months

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,860
so the third column on Drupal yet that

00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:45,650
wasn't their preference it was their

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:47,260
intranet other things I took out I

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,929
thought that you'd be interested in

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:54,950
hearing about from the time successes in

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:57,020
the survey so creativity efficiency and

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,570
ROI of kind of what you want to a data

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,090
table when you're looking for new

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:05,240
projects and they're looking for a part

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,970
or an interesting path when cooking

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,790
creative a lot of enterprise expects you

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,679
to really know the industry and really

00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,630
know the political there's more

00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,309
information you can bring around what

00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,400
other groups the industry joining

00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:22,010
setting and evaluating a large scope of

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,169
work maybe this is inherent and a large

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,410
enterprises looking for a very safe team

00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:29,750
it's something that's more a niche that

00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:33,370
is most multicultural marketing they

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:36,370
look to more small agency specific

00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,370
expertise

00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:48,320
okay so what's new next data

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,230
visualization is really coming online at

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,750
the moment this is a snapshot of a

00:32:51,230 --> 00:33:00,049
website that is working hard to uncover

00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,700
the profile of the visitor pretty

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:05,659
user-friendly here's the questions

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,820
basically a glorified quiz and then

00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,850
they're taking in the information on the

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,830
backend and it's in it a flat file and

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:17,240
they're you know using ad hoc systems to

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:19,760
make sense of it with Drupal and

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,809
personalization technologies and new

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,299
front-end tools we can use

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:30,110
interoperability to solve all that we

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:32,510
can grab the data that's in our existing

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,960
databases we can tie that to new data

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:38,270
that we're learning from website traffic

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,419
if you're a salesperson and you're

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,250
selling you know complicated financial

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,799
services product and you're trying to

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:50,720
show someone you know how their policy

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:53,630
looks you know a long document is really

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,390
hard to digest I mean when you get your

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,399
insurance policy every six months are

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,470
you really reading through it wouldn't

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,029
be better to have something visual that

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,620
you could look at that was personalized

00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:06,649
to you and showing you where you have

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:09,589
the opportunities to increase your

00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:12,440
protection this is where it's going and

00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:16,580
you know I hate to pull out an old movie

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,560
but when you would have data around you

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,750
and you can you know use 3d and other

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,230
technologies to assemble it I just think

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:27,800
there's a huge opportunity there to help

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:29,690
people visualize the data that that you

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,929
know they're capturing and understand it

00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,929
better

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:40,940
evie market massive changes being made

00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:44,720
there a lot of local city governments

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,510
are you know mandating police to start

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,750
driving electronic vehicles there's been

00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,389
a big push across the board for more eco

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,190
friendly operations like that and this

00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:58,820
is going to become more and more a part

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:01,099
of our life and currently there's

00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,859
charging stations but you don't know a

00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:07,700
whole lot of data about them until you

00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:12,200
get there there's a back net Drupal

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:16,089
module that ties in to energy systems

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:19,160
within buildings one vision could be

00:35:16,089 --> 00:35:21,980
having a website where you could locate

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,480
the charging stations and be able to see

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,619
how much juice each one of those

00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,140
stations has be able to see you know

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:32,359
what else is there maybe it's going to

00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,560
take two hours of charged car and it's

00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,780
right by a movie theater and you can

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,339
catch a movie at the time maybe it's by

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,440
a grocery store and you can use that

00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:41,630
opportunity to do your shopping so

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,400
imagine if you could grab all the energy

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,280
data sitting in this back net protocol

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,990
which is the standard around how all new

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,150
buildings are made and bring that

00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:56,750
forward using a drupal 7 in Tripoli

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:59,030
module another way to to make sure we're

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,790
headed in the right direction is to look

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,609
hard at your team structure how has it

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,859
changed over the years is it moving

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,500
you know in the hockey stick fashion

00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:12,560
here or is it staying stagnant how much

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,240
are you investing in new talent and

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,109
additional talent to support your

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,920
initiatives first question out of a

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:24,500
large enterprise CIF CIO is who's your

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,570
chief security officer if you don't have

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,540
someone dedicated to that piece you're

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,730
really really missing out that is

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,680
critically important quality assurance

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,310
sometimes something that we glean over

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,260
that is becoming more and more important

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,690
what type of talent is in demand today

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,609
and then do you have it and are you

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,480
working on plans to do

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:50,079
acquire you know five years ago smack is

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,790
all arrays social mobile analytics cloud

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,670
now we're talking more angular security

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,859
accessibility project manager is so so

00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,930
critical making sure these projects stay

00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:04,450
on the rails and then business and data

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,450
analytics is really reigning supreme

00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,040
training is a good way to evolve showing

00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:12,380
tremendous ROI across the board when you

00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,750
invest in training you can look inside

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,400
and ask yourselves you know what type of

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,980
training opportunities are you having

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,660
for your own self what training

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,609
opportunities are you supporting for

00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,490
your team and that's a big big

00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:27,349
opportunity I'm seeing more training

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:31,430
options in the Drupal community which is

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:34,820
which is good so what does this all mean

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,619
to you as a large enterprise if you're

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,780
out there working for a large enterprise

00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,930
you know the key question there is now

00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,480
that I've adopted it how far can we take

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,420
it and what are the benefits that's a

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,800
really really important question not

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:54,530
everyone knows what Drupal is I had a

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,180
second to the CIO asked me what trooper

00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,339
was just last week when they were

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:03,250
talking about bringing coming down on to

00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:05,480
one centralized platform you know are we

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,119
leveraging our investments in Drupal

00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,530
effectively what data are you looking at

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,130
to know that your Drupal solution is

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,680
working and then RIT and marketing in

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,530
line those are three critical bullet if

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,849
you're a digital agency you know ask

00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,040
that ask yourself that same question

00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:24,020
that Salesforce did you know what

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,950
happens if we have 12 target accounts we

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,710
get them all and they're all running

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,030
Drupal and where do we go next

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,339
and then for everyone I think you know a

00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,109
good question that we can ask ourselves

00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,780
is how do we describe true people in

00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:37,869
2004 and then how are we describing it

00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:42,819
in 2007

00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,819
this is Gartner's definition

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,880
are we happy with that

00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,740
all the information I've presented today

00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,599
in terms of how the technology is being

00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,550
used to grow the large enterprise to

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,910
shape the Internet I just think we're

00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,619
much bigger than a WCM at this point so

00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,950
we have to change that conversation as a

00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,950
group

00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:15,869
there's the Wikipedia definition and

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:18,359
we've really really evolved past that

00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:24,450
point but that hasn't changed in the

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:26,880
website yet so quick checklist and for

00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,119
success with the large enterprise change

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,550
management is top of mind

00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,020
I think the marketplace knows where they

00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,140
want to go they just need help in

00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,970
getting there I think as a community

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,970
we've got to do a much better job with

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:44,369
our case study I'm looking I'm learning

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,560
and it's just not doing much other than

00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:50,010
saying we thought we were charged with

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,630
this we delivered that not a lot of

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,250
measurable results in there that hang

00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,650
out hassle and not as many demos in a

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,109
marketplace that we should be looking at

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,589
so we all need to just write that our

00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:03,210
case studies and showcase almost more we

00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:06,270
need to learn how to translate Drupal's

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,369
language into the business language you

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,339
know the couple is just going to fly

00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:13,170
over the heads of many executives that

00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,970
are out there considering you know the

00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,200
Drupal platform bring it into language

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,530
like they can understand like an

00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,650
improved user experience discovery

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,330
process is something that is is critical

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,130
making sure before you start a new

00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,500
project you're learning all what the

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,000
requirements are and evolving with that

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,700
a lot of people don't know what

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,030
discovery is they don't they don't know

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,089
why it's required with the technology

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:41,099
like Drupal more and more we're managing

00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:42,930
projects in an agile way which is

00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:46,320
important that's you know delivering

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:49,440
more frequently to the specific needs of

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,770
the business but you have to blend that

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,630
with how companies are used to budgeting

00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:58,859
you know they're used to working in a

00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:01,020
very waterfall fashion road mapping is

00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,359
important you know where is our products

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,680
where's our platform going to be six

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,420
months from now where is it going to be

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,950
12 months from now where it's going to

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,770
be two years so now those are important

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,930
conversations conflicts a little bit

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,460
with managing projects in an agile way

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,260
because you're kind of going with what's

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,150
hot at the moment but it still should be

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,060
something that you're using as a as a

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,760
guiding light and then partnering with

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,630
procurement for everyone in the room

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,310
they are not our enemies they are our

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,650
friends they are controlling how

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,420
business gets done in the large

00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:36,810
enterprise and too often they're brought

00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,089
in at the last minute so making them

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:41,540
aware of the projects we're working on

00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:43,220
and involving them early is absolutely

00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,230
critical

00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:49,680
so I wanted to save about 10 minutes for

00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,440
questions or comments thank you very

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,920
much for um for your attention today I

00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,920
appreciate it

00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,409
[Music]

00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:09,569
any questions are coming so okay thank

00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:09,569
