	Beyond The .Com: Drupal’s new role in the Large Enterprise

In order to continue to grow your career with Drupal, it’s important to understand where the digital, web design and development marketplace is going - and where Drupal fits into it.  Who better to explore in this endeavor than those organizations who are trying to solve for the most complex digital, IT and marketing challenges on a global scale: The Large Enterprise.  This session is less about Gartner rankings and CMS comparisons, and more about you gaining an understanding how Drupal now fits into a global organization’s product roadmap in 2017 and beyond. After all, it’s not just an ECMS anymore!

This session is tailored to technology and digital strategy enthusiasts who love to see and hear exciting new Drupal use cases through the eyes of organizations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Travelport, Georgia Institute of Technology, NCR and Rinnai.  We will explore the primary challenges that the Large Enterprise is using Drupal to solve for, including:
