Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Creating a Culture of Engagement: The ROI of Transparency
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	In the last few years, “Engagement” has replaced “Wellness” as the catch-all employee retention buzzword. But what is engagement, exactly? It’s more than just building a killer physical workspace that employees want to perform their work in day to day - it’s building a cultural rapport of give and take; one where employees feel they can add to and be an active part of a brand's forward momentum.

Disengaged employees make up a startling 71% of the workforce in the US - those employees leave havoc in their wake, through negativity, decreased output, and absenteeism. Many employers believe that parting ways with difficult employees will improve their workforce, but the unfortunate reality is that the discontent moves with the departing employee, and can tarnish a company’s reputation with potential talent, and within their industry.

So, given the challenges of building and retaining a staff filled with top talent, what is a company to do? It’s crucial to create a culture of communication and accountability from the top-down. To champion and foster a value-based business, empowering senior leadership to set strategic and cultural goals, and encourage employees to communicate and take action to help meet those goals openly.

Join us to learn top-down strategies for fostering a killer company culture, no matter the company model.

In this session you will learn:

What employee engagement looks like
How to hold employees accountable for goals and their outcomes
The importance of transparency
Ways to create business value through culture
How to harness the talents of all personality types
Tactics to put ideas into action

actually got hacked

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,700
so my and got compromised so I had to

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,800
shut it down so it shows that I'm only

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,180

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,039

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,520
started here because we're just one like

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,370
30 seconds is our 5 o'clock on the nose

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,830
okay we'll go ahead and get started so

00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,780
welcome to my session this afternoon I'm

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,450
happy to welcome you my name is Anne

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,580
Stefanik I'm the founding CEO of canopy

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,040
studios I've been working in Drupal

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,990
since about 4-6 back in the days of

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,150
flexi known for those that are familiar

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,860
with flexi node so today this is just a

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,500
little bit where you can find me online

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,000
I run a company called canopy studios

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,950
and today my presenters notes are not

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,990
the same we're okay

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,490
today we're going to talk about employee

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,210
engagement and what it means for your

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,490
bottom line so I purposely started

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,490
canopy studios as a distributed agency

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,229
and in terms of employee engagement

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,660
working a distributed model has its own

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,750
unique challenges but today I'm going to

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,700
talk a little bit more in general term

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,739
canopy still has our first employee and

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,010
has a majority of the clients that we've

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,390
worked with we all that's all of our

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,980
contractors that have worked with us if

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,130
they're high quality they've become full

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,900
timers and we go out of our way at

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:34,400
canopy to make everybody feel at home

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,440
and like it's a good place to work while

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,560
I founded canopy the company is where

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,700
today thanks to the awesome team we I

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,390
thought it would be maybe an

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,250
eight-person shop and since October 2013

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,280
when I really started really pushing

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,250
canopy as a professional agency we grew

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,950
from just being to now 24 full-time

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,690
employees so it's been a lot of growth

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,489
over the last few years and a lot of

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,549
this has happened directly as a result

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,500
of our employees they've been happy they

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,330
kept our staff or our clients happy and

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,410
it encouraged other people to join our

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,330
team so before I get started just a

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,100
quick show of hands of how many are

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,609
super in love with their job yeah that's

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,150
awesome

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,860
that's

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,810
awesome and how many people are like

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,420
okay with their jobs are satisfied I

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,329
like it and how many people here are

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,170
looking for a new job

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:31,730
okay alright alright so and just a quick

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,560
to show of hands how many people are

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:39,739
bosses or manage people okay cool all

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,629
right so employment is a really

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,000
immutable connection and commitment

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,650
between the employee and the employer so

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,370
I understand this is our last session of

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,590
the day and the number one reason that

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,389
people like to their job is usually

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,970
their employees their other staff

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,340
members so because it's the end of the

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:08,840
day oh this is not your work for me

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:11,090
I just wanted to we are going to go to

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,359
page we're going to get up out of our

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:19,900
chairs and we're going to have some fun

00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:19,900
so let me see if I can get this going

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,870
okay everybody up and if you're not

00:04:30,220 --> 00:05:06,810
comfortable getting on to seeing your

00:04:31,870 --> 00:05:06,810
feet we've got to shake it out yeah guys

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,810
yeah well they're happy all right all

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,640
right

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,940
Tyrell feeling energized brought you a

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:36,750
good turn off this mountain

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:39,760
Oh we'll get back to this one second I

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:45,120
have a trick there we go

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:49,740
the mute button does wonders okay so

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,740
where's our presentation

00:05:50,750 --> 00:06:00,740
it seems like a really good idea at the

00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:10,610
time okay I'll get rid of you and

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:13,730
where's our presentation ah and let me

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:19,900
just sorry guys this is the technical

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,900
error here let me just go here and

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:43,010
okay apologies Hey okay great so now

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,040
that we're all jazz I'm going to share

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,140
some kind of depressing news so believe

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,630
it or not in America disengaged

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,290
employees make up over 71% of the

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,520
workforce

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,870
what's disturbing about that is that

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,300
more likely that disengaged employees

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,580
are negative unproductive and out of the

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,440
office more I think we have a pretty

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,940
magical community here in Drupal a lot

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,620
of people really love what they do and

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,730
there's a lot of companies that make

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,590
sure they take care of you their

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,360
employees so this is kind of the blob of

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,440
all of the companies in the US I think

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,770
it's probably a little bit different in

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,330
Drupal but we don't have those facts so

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,650
today we're going to cover some key

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,330
points we're going to talk about what

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,160
the culture of engagement and why is it

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,990
important we're going to talk about some

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,820
of the drivers we're going to talk about

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,860
some of the foundational steps that need

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,410
to happen within a company we need to

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,820
talk about the management level and then

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,669
finally we'll end up with some parks

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:39,080
benefits and extras okay so what is the

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,830
culture of engagement and why is it

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,390
important so as a starting place

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,970
engagement has replaced wellness as the

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,100
new catch-all buzzword but let's define

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,470
what wellness means and why wellness is

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,360
different from engagement wellness is

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,460
the idea by keeping people physically

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,440
happier or physically healthier they

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,130
will be more productive hence why you

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,040
see more options for healthy lunches or

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,750
rather your bike to work engagement is

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,210
the idea that an organization creates

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,430
conditions in which the employee has

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,590
free choice and has an intrinsic desire

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,440
to work on the best work in the best

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,700
interests of the organization so why is

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,150
engagement more important for retention

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,560
so disengaged employees they rarely

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,970
produce new solutions or bring

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,040
innovative ideas to the table

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,720
they have little interest in

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,050
contributing to the bigger picture and

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,089
being creative they often mindlessly go

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,680
through their job and they don't

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,470
remember in either conversations if

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,539
they've had any at all

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,700
so why not just fire it disengaged

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,900
employees well

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,940
first off that's not actually going to

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,360
solve your problem and you can

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,490
potentially ruin your reputation

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,530
negative feedback can be magnified more

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,600
than good and your company's reputation

00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:01,970
fit in credibility could be damaged by

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,070
just one disgruntled employee so as any

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,680
business owner knows turnover is very

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,810
expensive some studies predict that

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,720
every time a business loses a recovering

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,460
employee it takes six to nine months of

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,640
that salary on average to replace them

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,040
so for example if an employee's making

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,750
$80,000 a year and they leave it

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,820
potentially costed forty to sixty

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,970
thousand dollars in recruiting and

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,220
training expenses the fact is that

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,350
Happy's content in relationship are less

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,270
likely to break up and that's true both

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:39,290
in our professional life as well as our

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:41,090
personal life so companies have tried

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,400
all kinds of tactics to get employees to

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,740
enjoy work from beer fridges to pool

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,840
tables to snap rooms I live in San

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,850
Francisco and I've seen all kinds of

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,140
different employee engagement tactics if

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,580
you've been now to the Facebook or the

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,160
Google campus you'll know exactly what

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm talking about now while all those

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,420
things may be able to keep employees at

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,610
the office longer ultimately employees

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,280
are interested in increasing and making

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,410
a difference within the company so

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,360
having an engaged workforce makes the

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,300
employees feel more engaged in the

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,630
mission vision of the company itself not

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,040
just the perks of working there it's

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,780
important to remember that boosting

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,600
employee engagement isn't simply about

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,550
creating a cooler office space employee

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,870
engagement is an investment in your

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:29,150
mission and should be treated as a

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,220
two-way street so according to a Gallup

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,650
poll with engaged employees they perform

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,500
over 200 percent better I've seen stats

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,030
that are even higher than that and

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,930
employees when they feel like their work

00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,000
is meaningful

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,070
they weren't harder employees feel

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,630
satisfied they're better communicators

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,020
and they're more creative when they're

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,480
engaged they thrive on knowing they can

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,470
find new ways of completing tasks and

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,140
looking at

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,820
is freshly they're satisfied with their

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,240
careers and they're generally happier is

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:01,430
human furthermore they help attract top

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,440
talent and will help evangelize your

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:09,170
organization whether your service based

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,760
or cause based so I want to we're

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,350
talking a lot about disengaged employees

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,690
there's another set which are called

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,100
satisfied employees those are the people

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,670
that aren't necessarily unhappy or

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,180
disgruntled but satisfies employees are

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,610
there to give engaged employees are

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,860
there or sorry satisfied employees are

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,680
there to get verses engaged employees

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,960
are there to give so if you look at a

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,570
satisfied person in their job they're

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,850
usually doing the job they're looking at

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,200
making themselves successful and they

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,530
have a personal commitment to the

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,780
organization versus engaged employees

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,570
it's about doing the job over and above

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:52,150
it's about making myself on the company

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,150
successful and it's a mutual commitment

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,140
so we talked a little bit about what

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,060
engagement is and why it's important

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,750
let's talk for a minute about the

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,390
drivers of engagement if you're trying

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,670
to build a culture of engagement knowing

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,550
what your company stands for is a very

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,130
very crucial step you have to know your

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,350
mission your vision and your purpose if

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,300
all gives your company a rallying point

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,500
and something your employees and your

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,900
clients can get behind also for those in

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,810
management or leadership positions based

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,420
on research inspirational leadership can

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,970
be depart without it it may feel like

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,030
the organizational is rudderless and

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,310
headless I've seen great companies that

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,710
when their leader leaves the company

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,170
doesn't do as well it's because that

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,990
energy of the leader is bringing the the

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,930
vivaciousness to the company so know who

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:54,350
you are know who your company is and be

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:56,750
bold so the drivers of engagement the

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,780
first part is to define and evangelize

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,250
again your mission is what guides our

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,410
actual

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,960
and organized in the organization it

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,020
spells out the overall gold and provides

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,320
a path for decision making

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,720
for example a canopy your oddest fun

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,430
transparent clear curious and caring

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,900
we're empowered to make decision

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,410
collectively to build a company that

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,270
makes a difference the vision the vision

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,580
is what the owner the founder of the

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,930
company wants the company to achieve in

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,890
the future what the strategic direction

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,810
is so it can be we're a real data driven

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,450
company with focus on excellent customer

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,670
service we value freedom above all else

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,950
which is freedom of thought freedom of

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,660
speech freedom to do what's right for

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,690
the client for the community for the

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,600
company freedom to be creative freedom

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,100
to work and do a work wherever suits you

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,140
best

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,600
but with this commitment to results and

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,670
the metrics to measure these we can

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,330
easily see success and we can easily

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,280
measure that and celebrate it and then

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,050
your purpose is really like why your

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,570
company exists like what's the

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,550
fundamental reason so our purpose is to

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,020
build awesome websites that not only are

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,940
beautiful to look at but also are

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,350
expertly coded so the purpose of

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,930
bringing this up is that your leadership

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,480
team it's their responsibility to carry

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,850
this mission out and to communicate it

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,040
all of your staff if you ask them at any

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,050
given time what our vision is you should

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,730
be able to say it without looking at a

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,500
book or finding out where were where

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,660
they're at so you also want them to be

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,820
involved in the evolution of ideas well

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,440
we were trying to build our value set we

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,060
did a workshop and I said okay this is

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,860
what I think we're evaluating are we

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,950
actually valuing that and some people

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,170
were a little timid because I'm a height

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,930
extrovert and I'll talk about this a

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,510
little later but we work with a lot of

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,010
introverts so for me to stand up there

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,990
and be like okay what's our value let's

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,630
go alright go go go go go it's a very

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,280
intimidating and intense place so we

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,990
created a club space where everybody

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,940
could collaborate asynchronously and

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,800
come online and work on that or

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,580
contribute in a way that was more easy

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
for them to share so when we found that

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,270
people are engaged with the mission the

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,380
value in the purpose

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,450
you become emotionally attached to

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,850
vision and there believe in what the

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:23,110
organization stands for they'll be more

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,000
committed and they'll be more loyal he

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,600
also is really important to clarify role

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,920
and the expectations of those roles this

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,810
is something that if you're a fast

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,150
growing company your employees may or

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:37,780
may not have job descriptions madam I

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,700
didn't and if you don't have some of

00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,230
those expectations that are clear and

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,540
some of the basic materials and

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,930
equipment provided boredom may result

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,790
and when boredom is there your employee

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,490
may spend more time thinking about how

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:56,290
they can be relevant versus how they can

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:59,070
help your organization succeed how many

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:06,940
organizations here are under 20 people

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:09,850
now over 30 okay so two things about

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,950
that one we're a very small flat

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,600
organization of twenty four so there's

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,220
not a lot of room for middle management

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,920
it just absolutely actually doesn't

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,260
exist so when we're talking about career

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
advancement and we're more talking about

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,430
an increase in skill set an increase in

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,550
client touch an increasing

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:30,190
responsibility and less about elevated

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,750
titles when someone comes to me and says

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,100
I want a job but I want this title I

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,240
think oh my goodness that person no

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,620
matter how awesome they are they're

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,760
never going to work here because they're

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,180
going to want this middle management

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,460
here that I'm not interested in offering

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,020
so when you're thinking about you know

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,840
when you're working with a small

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,610
business like the 30 and under kind of

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,910
space you're looking at setting clear

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,220
expectations and working with them about

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,560
potential career advancements is crucial

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,700
these discussions around goals skill

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,650
developments and changes and

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,380
responsibilities can be very motivating

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,450
if it's never discussed they may just

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,360
leave and you won't know until it's too

00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,430
late if you're in a larger organization

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,230
and you have middle management it's so

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,570
imperative that your managers are super

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,240
clear on who they're supposed to manage

00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,490
and what are those results I highly

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,100
symbol Eve that is disengaged well it's

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,740
a fact that a disengaged manager equates

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,570
to disengage staff so if your managers

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,250
are disengaged or satisfied it's

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,650
seriously look at if they're being

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,430
effective because they will essentially

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,470
cause attrition with your team if you're

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,360
a small company like us we do a couple

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,860
of tools and tactics when people get on

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,690
board so they're familiar with the other

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,980
can plummet company remember people like

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,470
to work at companies because of all the

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,970
other people that work there I runs with

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,430
Parkson and a bunch of other people the

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,770
Bay Area Drupal Camp a lot of us used to

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,320
work at chapter 3 when we left we still

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,180
wanted to work together so we kept

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,400
working on bad half it gave us meaning

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,050
it gave us connection so if knowing that

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,790
people is the fundamental number one

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,680
reason it's not about working on

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,690
meaningful projects it's not about

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,580
building the best modules or you know

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,900
it's you know pushing the most awesome

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,660
code out there it's really about the

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,550
connections that we share so it's really

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,040
easy in a small organization to know

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,870
everybody but as you scale or you get a

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,430
little bit busy bigger it's really

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,730
important to put in some tools and

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,810
tactics to be able to stay connected I

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,400
recently learned about this tool called

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,290
know your company which is a really cool

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,820
thing we do the Psalter Google Docs so

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,230
someone comes on board first day they

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,270
fill in their first day thing which is

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,980
more of like how you know who are you

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,260
what do you do and all of that gets

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,420
spread out so everybody else can learn

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,460
about each other know your company is

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,710
kind of a more bigger tool for companies

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,660
are like 30 people and over but allows

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,800
to have some of that dynamic connections

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,330
especially if you're in a remote

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,430
business and don't have the opportunity

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:54,080
to meet face-to-face so let's talk a

00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,740
little bit about I mean a lot of this

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,180
again is that providing the clear vision

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,580
providing a clear solid ground of roles

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,750
and responsibilities and expectations

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,590
then the next one comes to course

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:10,250
correction delivering feedback can be

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,900
really scary and it also is the key to

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,690
giving your employees a sense of where

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,600
they're going and because it's so

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:21,950
uncomfortable a lot of people just put

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,990
it off or they only focus on praise but

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,530
engaged employees want to know where

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,210
they stand they want honest transparent

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,370
conversation and in order to understand

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,280
how to better serve the organizational

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,610
goals and within the boundaries of what

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,519
they're working with

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,809
employee engagement is a direct

00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,190
reflection of the relationship with

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,860
their manager like I mentioned before

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,260
and really again if that management

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,320
relationship is fractured no amount of

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:54,580
perks will encourage those people to

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,700
perform at top levels finally and you

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,940
hear me talk about this a lot is honest

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:03,159
transparent communication extremity

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,130
we're totally distributed so we have a

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,929
few things in place to stay connected we

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,870
have an all-hands every week or every

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,549
other week and one of those wanted to

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,980
play games and have fun and do silly

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,240
things and just like hang out but the

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,279
other one is to share company

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,010
information and share you know what's

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,409
happening in the company then we have a

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,350
quarterly townhall and our quarterly

00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:28,450
townhall is a time when the managers

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,950
come together and they share key

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,929
information about what's happening and

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,470
I'm totally transparent about all our

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:38,080
financials in that meeting just a quick

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,090
poll of ham of the managers or bosses

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,230
how many people share their financials

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:47,409
with their employees okay that is a good

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,450
sign that is a good sign I am just

00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,460
learned to do this recently and my

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:56,049
goodness what it's pretty amazing what

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,960
sanitize so you know when you're talking

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,940
about connecting we also have what we

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,309
call a Friday friendly deaths from so

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,630
every Friday everybody gets on is the

00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,190
five minute like what are you working on

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,480
but more importantly what are you doing

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,850
on the weekend what's happening in your

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,409
personal life those kinds of especially

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,210
if you're distributed because we don't

00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,039
have the water cooler the lunches

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,850
together it's really important to create

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,019
that sense of community and then I

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,600
personally meet with all of our

00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,190
employees at least once a quarter and I

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,389
cherish those times because I get to

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,429
hear things maybe they didn't want to

00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,889
talk to their manager about or you know

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,029
maybe they're wanting to talk to to HR

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,830
about career advances but they don't

00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,419
know quite how to view it or you know

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,669
however that is so it's a really great

00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:40,240
place to have an open and keep that open

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,710
door for them to come to you so it's

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,510
really really really key to be

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,059
transparent about organizational health

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,460
because that can really propel your

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,220
employees to act strategically involve

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,289
them in the Strada

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:56,480
gee and they will improve your process

00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:57,909
so let's talk about some steps that need

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,100
to happen within a company

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:03,020
first off recognize that your your

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,409
employees are just as important as your

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,950
clients create this realistic honest

00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:13,669
recognition system communicate again

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,679
clear transparent direct and celebrate

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,750
the work that they do let employees know

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,159
that they're contributing show them how

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,590
they're contributing to the bottom line

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,429
and how they're making a difference it's

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,320
really impactful for them to see well we

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,480
don't share maybe full spreadsheets just

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,640
just your pie charts or browse to

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,780
generally show and we can show that you

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,669
know if there's a pie chart of all the

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,919
sales and this is all the new business

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,840
but this business came from up sales and

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,360
support and this came from up sells and

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,860
the professional services then all the

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,240
team members like oh yeah I hope they're

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,549
under bad that's awesome

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,230
and so those kind of things really help

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,940
people understand where the company is

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,440
going and then they can feel part of the

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,480
solution so I'm such a big fan of

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,620
communication I wanted to dive into that

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,780
just a little bit more here so we forget

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,299
that when we're on the top tier of

00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,450
information so many of our employees are

00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:09,770
not privy to the information we have and

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,289
assumptions can breed fear and grow a

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,110
rumour mill if you're worried about

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:20,090
something chances are your staff are

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:23,659
already talking about it so here's an

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:26,750
example in q4 of 2016 canopy hit our

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,429
very first rough patch and we had a few

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,630
clients that just decided to soft work

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:31,429
due to the changes in the economic

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,870
situation we will give a lot in our

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,630
profits and they just were absolutely

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,900
terrified their funding so when we're

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,919
looking at that I was terrified I was

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,299
like oh my goodness we're going into

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,640
Christmas we had two of our biggest

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:45,289
clients fall out I'm terrified what if I

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,970
can't like what happens we have this

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,159
reserve we're going to be okay but I'm

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,130
stressing out and so I turn to the

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,409
direct managers and we have three asides

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,929
from my sister who's VP of all ops and I

00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,220
said okay so I have to show you

00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,390
something and I'd like everybody to sit

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,289
down and take a nice deep breath and

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,300
we're going to get through this that I

00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,890
need to show you something

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,180
I said based on these projects falling

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,680
out and all of our staff being full-time

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,680
that's a--that's a--that's-- enough and

00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,430
they all said we got you we're going to

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,200
do this together

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,520
how can I help and I was like really

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,140
you're not freaking out

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,240
I like well yeah we're freaking out you

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,880
know we're freaking out with you

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,770
we're all going to be okay we always get

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
through this and then next thing you

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,060
know I was like okay so we got this town

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,350
hall coming up and it's like the first

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,300
time it's not going to be like roses and

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,070
Sun shines and sparkles and they're like

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,540
let's start with decide about roses and

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,880
Sun shines and sparkles and that is not

00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,320
always this way I'm like okay so that

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,270
was the first time I really took my

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,590
financials to the team if I never really

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,920
thought it was something they needed to

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,990
see but my goodness isn't impactful when

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,930
I was able to be honest and clear and

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,870
transparent about where we were what

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:52,570
happens the team got together they

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,070
huddle they came up with solutions they

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,630
went and we're like oh this support

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,730
client I know they have some hours to

00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,110
spend before year-end we can get them to

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,670
sign a hundred hour change runner right

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,440
now we've just been too busy to deal

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,730
with it okay so next thing you know I

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,350
had the team coming up with creative

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,180
solutions they're willing to work on

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,740
blog posts or marketing anything they

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,210
could do to further and make sure that

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,080
canopy was going to be okay for the long

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:16,240
term and we're stronger today because of

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,130
it we know we have each other's back

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,690
when times might get a little rough and

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,280
we all know that working in the agency

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,940
space it's like this it's a roller

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,500
coaster

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,410
unfortunately in Drupal it's been a

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,330
pretty awesome up roller coaster but

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,490
economic time and economic changes

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,200
contain like economic clients can change

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,670
and therefore we can be put into unique

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,390
situations that we weren't expecting at

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:39,790
all the employees are constantly

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,440
watching leadership there watching

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,930
leadership to see their decisions and

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,730
how it affects they want to see how how

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,620
their behaviors are like what they say

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,810
are they going to do what they said so

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,820
it's really important to only say what

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:54,540
you're going to do and then do that but

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,330
it's also important to have feedback so

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,310
as a business owner that really means we

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,830
need to make time for the managers to

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,930
manage we need to take an honest look at

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,780
Bill ability and profitability and try

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,460
to communicate transparently I am the

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,530
number one person to find oh you're a

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,970
really capable manager guess what I'm

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,030
going to put so much on your plate

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,440
right so as as as the boss lady I need

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,120
to really be mindful to say okay no

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,860
Friday's is for one-on-one days you have

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,390
to figure that out but it takes some

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,730
give-and-take and it takes the morning

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,530
and it takes your manager being brave to

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,600
say I have too much work I've got to

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,010
take care of my as my own staff I need

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,450
to do this and that's really hard when

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,250
you've got client pressures and you've

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,510
got you know launches pending and so

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:39,790
forth but those conversations they're so

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,260
fundamental that it's okay to push a one

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,610
on line it's okay to move things around

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,440
your spouse is going to be totally

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,790
understanding but if you ignore your

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,020
staff for two or three months and

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,760
they've got something they feel like

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,110
they're holding out for then all the

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,730
sudden they feel disgruntled and they

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,810
may move into that satisfied category

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,070
and then they may even move into

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,070
disgruntled and actually leave

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:04,170
so speaking of communication I want to

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,170
talk a little bit about introverts

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,440
they're highly cerebral and creative

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:13,210
people

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,400
I am a uber extrovert so I am probably I

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,190
realized very intense for a lot of my

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,410
staff I read a book recently recommended

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,390
by one of my tasks because he is engaged

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:26,770
and want the company to be awesome and

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,990
he knows I'm very loud and my nickname

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,740
is Mack trucks in the morning ball ball

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,420
ball so when we're looking at he

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,550
recommended this book and if everybody

00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,950
works in this industry I'd highly

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,670
recommend it's called quiet the power of

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,580
introverts

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,840
by student a anything but quiet the

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,210
power of introverts you're going to find

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,730
it and it really helped me greatly

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,860
understand my team and how to work in a

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,750
way that works best for them and again

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,390
it was one of my employees that came and

00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,520
said you're an extrovert that manages

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,690
like 20 introverts you need this book

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,670
because he cares so investing in your

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,710
team and understanding goes a long way

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,990
and listening if I just threw that book

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,430
on my desk and kept working he probably

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,050
wouldn't have felt so good even though

00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,230
he's like super jazzed about what he's

00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:16,330
doing and so knowing that this

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,530
fundamentally changed the way that we

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,210
work with employees and it's just about

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,980
things like I prepare information in

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,830
advance and I give them give it

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,270
them in advance to prepare the shotgun

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,669
approach of meeting like let's work on

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,650
our values I read this book fortunately

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,299
beforehand and I realized my traditional

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,160
method of like let's brainstorm let's

00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:38,799
get in a group talk about it is really

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,510
overwhelming and intimidating so what we

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,130
did is it by switching the format we got

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,480
a better response and more people felt

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,940
like they can actually collaborate and

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:53,080
connect as we read this book we're a big

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:55,390
advocate of diversity and this really

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,820
helps understand how our team is very

00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,950
diverse and we also required our

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,299
managers to understand that they still

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,100
have to provide boundaries if you're

00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,900
going to give information to an employee

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,549
to dig into and they'd like some

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,200
wormhole and go really deep give them

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:10,090
boundaries so they know where the edges

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,010
are and that you have that again that

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:18,340
consistent feedback you can check in

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:20,320
with them so remember to always always

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,910
always remains and can create that

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,570
communication and environment for that

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:29,770
where communication can foster your team

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:33,580
wants to be part of the solution so just

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:35,530
to sum up in communications really be

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,110
willing to have those conversations good

00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:41,380
bad performance about leadership if

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,040
you're really busy stop what you're

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,470
doing

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,980
turn off black turn off your email that

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:50,230
their book them in the eye and talk so

00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,730
many managers are on multitasking

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,049
because they feel like they have to or

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,210
they won't catch they won't be able to

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,530
catch a breath but it's so important if

00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,179
your employees feel like they're coming

00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,679
to you and you're not focused and like

00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:03,760
they like why are we even having this

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,040
one online another one is be really good

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,070
at addressing situations directly and

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,380
immediately and with consistency nobody

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,309
wants to be in trouble but sometimes

00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,010
things go wrong

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,750
so it's really important to not save it

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,460
for the review in three months is to

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,530
bring it up right away and have an

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,020
honest transparent conversation where

00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,340
you're like so you know this this thing

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,260
happened this launch they you know

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,880
whatever the situation is and you ask

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,429
them for like how did you think it went

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,350
and how do you feel about the situation

00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,510
how do you think you can improve because

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,980
most often people know when they screw

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,840
up

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,940
and they don't mean to it's usually an

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,549
accident I tell everybody you can screw

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,070
up laws just try not to screw up at the

00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:45,539
same thing you know we all make mistakes

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,519
such as you can't make the same mistake

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,880
over and over because then that that's

00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,500
not good

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,490
be willing to take suggestions and act

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,889
on them if you do if you're willing to

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,080
change based on what feedback they give

00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:03,389
to you they'll be more willing to open

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,130
up just like when I got that book if I

00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:06,750
wouldn't have read it I probably would

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,010
have shut down but because I read it we

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,649
were able to have this really rich

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,630
conversation and it directly impacted

00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:16,320
how the companies how the company works

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:20,039
together and finally invest in your

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,570
management team at canopy we invested in

00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,590
an HR manager hiring a senior HR manager

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,360
facilitated leadership training and

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:30,299
support for staff and professional

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,649
growth and my goodness did it help a lot

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,440
when I had to have difficult

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:37,440
conversations is it's inevitable when

00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:42,570
you're managing people at first everyone

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,889
is like what we're getting HR okay I'm

00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,899
really scared

00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:48,690
am I going to be fired perfect no no no

00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:51,360
no no no no the reason every respondent

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,460
said we hire an HR because we care about

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,070
our company and we want canopy to be

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,630
here for the long term we care about our

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,960
collective happiness and we care about

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,880
diversity we only hire people a canopy

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,830
that have proven experience so as you

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,649
can imagine career pathing for senior

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,539
folks is incredibly challenging a lot of

00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:11,039
them are ones contractors so maybe

00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,870
they're not quite used to working in a

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,169
day job it's a little bit different of a

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,690
structure and as a CEO I could only do

00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:21,149
so much because we had such an awesome

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,740
staff that were so engaged every single

00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,799
developer was turning to me and be like

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,389
I super love what I'm doing how do I be

00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,130
better and I'm like I don't know I come

00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:33,630
from an account services background I

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,019
come from from sales business

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,809
development and well I am very technical

00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:41,519
I am NOT a developer so when I had 18

00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:45,840
developers turning to me for career

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,100
passing I was like yeah okay so a we

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,260
hired a director of engineering who's

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,720
super badass dirty

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:55,669
cat she's right there whoo but the nice

00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,169
part about that is that of course she's

00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:59,570
the director of engineering so career

00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:01,460
pathing well it is part of her job we

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,540
really needed an HR manager to help that

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,580
so together

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,980
Aaron and cat work really closely to

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,809
provide a good solid foundation we got

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,520
to rewrite all the job descriptions and

00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,380
we really have to because we have grown

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,360
organically everything was all over the

00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,880
place like it was really messy and

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,990
people that came in really long ago they

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,309
I mean the new people had job

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,230
descriptions that the old people and

00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:23,690
they're like am ia tech lead or am i

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,390
senior developer and I you know so

00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,679
creating this like baseline and working

00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,600
with that and because I strongly believe

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,120
that technical people should be managed

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,220
by technical people having that role

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,070
with chat and Aaron blended to really

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,059
support the employees they felt really

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,799
heard and they felt like they could

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:46,730
connect with their managers and really

00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:49,400
move forward so um let's talk a little

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,049
bit about perk benefits and extras that

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,270
can help foster management and

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:57,470
engagement some of these things cost

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:59,660
money but in honest but honestly some of

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:03,160
the most effective methods we have for

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,160
employee engagement are totally free

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,520
okay so employees want the opportunity

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,490
to develop and grow professionally

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,840
that's hands down either if they love

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,300
working with your staff or they have

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,310
career advancement opportunities all the

00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,020
other stuff is definitely important but

00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,140
those two are the fundamental two core

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,580
things so having a defined professional

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,280
development plan for both the company

00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,300
and for the employees is wonderful for

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,640
your recruiting and training a

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,520
recruiting tactics you can help them see

00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,750
themselves there again building up and

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,610
to be as simple as looking to job

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:42,860
descriptions to finding expectations

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:44,840
coaching employees this so employees

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,160
again sites that their primary reason

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,340
for enjoying work is strong employee

00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,070
engagement and this often may come from

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,380
like happy hours interoffice cut offs or

00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,180
picnics but in case but in the case of

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,420
canopy while we're totally distributed

00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,580
this looks a little bit differently you

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,810
see these tacos here hustlers have

00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,000
actually become a huge part of our

00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:08,090
culture like I love tacos to start with

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,360
but there's this app on flash and it's

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,910
called hey taco and I highly recommend

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,860
what we did at canopy Studios is we have

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,470
flash I'm sure everybody uses flash most

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,480
people use black or I'm sure another

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,150
form of communications and we have a

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,970
channel called fake everybody's in the

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,130
channel and what we do is we put hey

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,390
taco in the channel so totally free for

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,800
one channel if you want to put it in all

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,280
channels it's like one dollar per person

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,860
and that taco app people can give each

00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,510
other tacos they're like great job on

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,650
the launch thanks for helping out with

00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:45,110
documentation and this thanks Channel

00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:48,230
people have gone nuts over it they

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,940
thanked each other every day they show

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,400
up in the mornings big some of them but

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,680
you only get five tacos a day you run

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,640
out of tacos we have 24 people I have

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,900
more people to thank

00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,430
and they're like can you thank this

00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,840
person for me they did an awesome job

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,520
and like people are logging on the

00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,020
weekend I have ten tacos to give away

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,470
this weekend like I'm doing or where my

00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:08,120
car goes and like the excuted gifts come

00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,800
up in our things and it's like you

00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,830
received your 80s taco and it's like

00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,040
this taco man it is the stupidest thing

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,640
and we love it so if you take nothing

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,019
away

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,210
this presentation other than installing

00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:21,470
hey taco on a thanks Channel that's

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,400
that's going to make your employees like

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:28,069
super stoked so I vote on that another

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,809
one that we do is we hold open office

00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:32,660
hours where we just open up a slack

00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:35,660
channel or a zoom channel we're a video

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,339
first company so we believe that if you

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,140
are working from home you need to get to

00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,569
rest and I mean I always say pants are

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,480
optional as long as you don't stand up

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:48,920
right we do charge cap because someone's

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,859
the doorbell does ring but you're

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,839
looking at like people coming on video

00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,029
so you can connect with them you can see

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,339
their eyes it's so important when you're

00:36:56,029 --> 00:37:00,289
working in a distributed company or even

00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:03,260
in the office - like connects and say hi

00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:04,549
how you doing so well we like to jump

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,339
right into business we're very

00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:08,660
fast-moving we like to get stuff done we

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:10,789
always take just a few minutes at the

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,789
front of the each meeting how's it going

00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:15,349
how's your cat how's your baby

00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:16,849
awesome we see their cat going across

00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:19,579
the screen anyways we know their cats

00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,140
very well but but really those

00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:22,819
co-working sessions and those video

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,130
chats are integral to creating a

00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:30,589
connection we also create a peer-to-peer

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,480
buddy system for new employees so when

00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:33,980
new employees come on board they're

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,450
gonna have their manager and they're

00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,130
probably gonna ultimately you know

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,750
report to me or whatnot we're going to

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,279
have our managerial stuff but that will

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,569
apear them with someone that doesn't do

00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:46,279
what they do so for example we have a

00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:49,130
new support developers who's come on

00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:52,160
board I can get paired with the designer

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,839
and it's more to talk about company

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,049
culture some of those things that are

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,000
the in between so when Carlos arches at

00:37:57,049 --> 00:38:00,769
home so where do I find this or how do I

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,230
go there what not make it past those

00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:04,819
questions to their peers without having

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,630
to maybe go to their direct manager

00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:06,980
because they feel like well I should

00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,569
have read that already or maybe it's

00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,180
from where I have artist was supposed to

00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:13,220
look and because you don't know anybody

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,019
as we create those peer to peer groups

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,220
and that really helps create a foster of

00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:20,599
bonding we also believe that no

00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,900
developer should ever be thrown under

00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:26,869
the bus ever software development is

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,090
hard what our jobs are are hard and we

00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:31,340
deliver big website

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,200
we also deliver slow website but often

00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,640
the reality is is that we want to

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,640
protect our team and we want to go to

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,790
bat for our team things screw up but

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,340
canopy takes this ownership canopy takes

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,990
the responsibility and while we may on

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,000
our back channels and really help

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,140
encroach that employee to a place of

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,150
better improvement and better

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,700
performance ultimately we're there to

00:38:50,150 --> 00:39:05,210
protect and trust each other so there is

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:08,000
also the competitive pay there is most

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,320
often employees don't leave a job for a

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,480
bigger salary

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,280
unless it's substantially bigger like if

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,500
they're going from 50k to 500k like I

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,990
would I would do that job to you but I

00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,030
mean really happy employees are willing

00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,400
to do more with less in exchange for

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,590
life work balance strong professional

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,260
relationship and an input into the

00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:29,210
direction management of the company

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,670
so while pay and benefits are a key

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,710
indicator of employee engagement or

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,660
sorry if they're not a key indicator

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,120
employee engagement offering competitive

00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,710
compensation benefits and reasonable

00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,980
working conditions should be a part of

00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,770
your overall strategy for example I

00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,690
force vacation if you're on vacation and

00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,250
I see you on flat or on your email you

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,410
are officially in trouble like

00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,500
officially we know if there's an

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,770
emergency we can call yourself home we

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,850
know there's cell phones

00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,740
other than that you need to uninstall

00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,960
flash on your phone you need to find out

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,730
a gmail you need to let it all go we

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,300
don't live our babies we build websites

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,950
it's going to be ok we're going to be ok

00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,360
but forcing vacation is is something

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,380
that's really important because people

00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:19,010
need to relax ok

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:26,660
so engagement is about capturing your

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:29,180
employees heads and their hard resulting

00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,600
in discretionary efforts which is the

00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,680
magic cess

00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,360
leading to superior through this result

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:43,290
so thank you so much for coming today

00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:46,020
I've got some time for Q&A because the

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:49,110
magic dust really is in happy employees

00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,520
so I hope y'all had fun dancing and

00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,380
you're going to take some of these

00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,050
things home to spread your own magic

00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,790
dust around with your staff I'm happy to

00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,830
take questions I just ask that you use

00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:05,310
the microphone and introduce yourself

00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:09,450
first if that's the case hi my name is

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:11,790
Kendra um and we have an employee who's

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:14,610
just poisoned in terms of our culture

00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:18,540
but he's actually vital to a lot of our

00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:21,840
projects so he's super smart but he's a

00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,820
jerk he's a jerk to everybody he's very

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,020
condescending he thinks he's better than

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,880
everybody but man he's genius so how

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,450
would you deal with that have you

00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,730
started recruiting for his replacement

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:38,250
almost in our area it's very difficult

00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,620
to find people with this level of

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,140
expertise you know number management so

00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,000
we're we're thinking about it but any

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,740
tips on how to handle him and how to

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,520
handle him with employees while we're

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,800
trying to figure out how to replace him

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,170
yeah I think that the biggest thing is

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,850
have you had a conversation with him

00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,280
about the impact that he's making on the

00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:03,210
business multiple times

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,440
can you send him to work from home yes

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,170
yeah

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,180
if he's if he's very poisonous to your

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,130
organization he'll be poisoning all of

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,660
your other employees he's like a vortex

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,880
he'll be taking down your other staff

00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,430
and honestly it may cost you more in

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,170
your business to keep him on board than

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,050
to feel the pain of letting him go

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:26,670
we had a rock star an absolute rock star

00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:28,260
that I loved and and but when it came

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,000
down to being actually kind and

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,520
compassionate towards other humans and

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,440
it didn't fit we let her go because it

00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,390
just wasn't worth it even though she was

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,890
a total rock star and we suffered we had

00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,150
to like pulled together do okay you have

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,340
no idea what we're doing here we gotta

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:43,170
figure this out and I think it's so

00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,910
important to build redundancy into roles

00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,829
so that

00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,990
nobody ever becomes the one and only

00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,520
saying that drives you know because

00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,430
that's so dangerous for you as an

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,250
organization because if he decides to

00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:58,069
flip the table and burn he will do it in

00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,710
a really bad way and not very Dean's are

00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:03,530
so politely ask him to work from home

00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,089
maybe he contributes via voice or

00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,069
something if he's being condescending in

00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:09,500
and so forth and honestly I would start

00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:11,329
writing him up because if you do have to

00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,380
let him go and you haven't done the

00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,760
proper paperwork

00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,240
he's the kind of guy that's going to

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,950
come and see you so put the paper work

00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,299
because it's a paper work that's going

00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,799
to protect you and even though we're a

00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:23,240
very married like I'm sure it's at-will

00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,640
for a lot of people that bring on

00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,950
employees protecting yourself and your

00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,530
employees is a really important part and

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:33,109
it might be something like if he's a

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,089
super rock star I mean we're all real

00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:37,690
rock stars I'm sure there's maybe even a

00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:40,369
contractor that could help part-time if

00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,200
there's maybe team members can take on

00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:44,630
you might want to go to your other team

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,150
members and say like hey you know Jack

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,490
does these 17 things can you do one of

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,190
them any of them oh yeah I can actually

00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,990
do for you might be surprised what your

00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,970
other team members can take off of his

00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,250
plate so that if you do need to let him

00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,920
go without a replacement maybe there's

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,119
only three things that are missing

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,740
because I was always like one of those

00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:05,539
things where I kind of turned and I

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,980
found out that hey you know there's

00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:09,500
there we have fairly great copywriters

00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,940
in-house and I had no clue right we have

00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,190
our design we have our one of our femurs

00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,010
that's like hey I can do UX I can do you

00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,599
a so you can okay cool let's do it but

00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,609
you know having those conversations are

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,109
so important and I think being honest

00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:23,869
with your team members to let them know

00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,579
hey we understand that you know Jack's

00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,400
been really hard on you so do you want

00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,690
to talk about anything are you okay

00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,190
because it's the other team members that

00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,380
really you kind of need to be worrying

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,210
about that those are the ones that may

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,690
leave as a result because you haven't

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,039
dealt with Jack so I'm sorry you're in

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:46,029
that situation though that's a tricky

00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:46,029
spot yeah okay

00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,640
should we get back to dancing or any

00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,640
other question

00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,610
hi there I'm Sebastian I'm running an

00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,680
agency that is growing a lot right now

00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:06,080
and for us we have a very large

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,450
contractor for awhile for me very large

00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,980
contractor pool 12 people and I was

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:15,710
wondering to what extent today's topic

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,410
could be also applicable to a contractor

00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:21,860
pool like how many how many of these

00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:24,950
principles would you yes would you apply

00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,930
to that kind of a work force yeah do you

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,380
um do you plan to bring them full time

00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:32,540
ever we you know right now we're growing

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,210
a lot so once things stabilized I'm

00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:37,400
perhaps I mean it depends how this year

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:40,160
goes but yeah I I would like definitely

00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,470
to convert a number of my contractors to

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,420
employees yeah when I know the time is

00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:46,820
ready yeah I would tell them that I

00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,830
would be like hey I love what you're

00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,780
doing here this is so amazing thank you

00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,310
so much for helping us out are you

00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,770
interested in ever becoming full-time

00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,110
because when we stabilize if you can be

00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,030
on my team that would rock maybe like oh

00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,740
so you kind of plant the seed there's a

00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,030
lot of contractors I did the same model

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,620
right when I started off I had to have

00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,630
contractors is way too risky to have

00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,910
employees and I was like oh but I need

00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,290
them to be engaged and that the reason I

00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,160
found contractors a little tricky to

00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,260
work with is because they're a

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,670
one-person show and they often have

00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,980
their own way of doing things their own

00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,260
processes their own time their own way

00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,300
and so to melt them into your process

00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,740
might be like an onboarding checklist

00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,240
like here's all the things that we do on

00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,520
our agency that we need you to help us

00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,140
with and so they can find on early to

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,700
say ok yeah I got to be online by 10:00

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,760
a.m. and I got to commit code every day

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,890
and I got to be video first and we have

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,870
a communications charter which helps

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,710
people understand where to go when and

00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,630
we share that with all of our

00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,130
contractors so they have a clear

00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,470
understanding of our expectations for

00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,520
communications in some ways if you're

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,920
thinking about bringing them on

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,620
full-time then almost like treat them

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,990
like full-time employees with the same

00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,670
kind of like one-on-ones it might not be

00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:54,110
something that you need to dive super

00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,860
deep but you want to know their career

00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:59,210
paths because in that same model working

00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,580
with contractors that want to stay

00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,900
contractors are never they're going to

00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,490
be good for the time but you might not

00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,610
want to focus your energy on them as

00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,470
much as the others but again telling

00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,790
them they rock is usually the first step

00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,580
to do

00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:15,160
oh and then specific like this totally

00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,380
rock this impacted this client because

00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,370
of you you did this because of the way

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,320
that you worked with the team members

00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,090
this happened they all of a sudden feel

00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,010
more connected so when the time comes to

00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,810
be full-time like our contractors were

00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,810
just like okay we ready we're so excited

00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:30,160
and we get health care whoo I even like

00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,480
this different perks that they're going

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,660
to figure out oh we're I don't have to

00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,880
hustle for work anymore so yeah I think

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,350
a lot of these still apply especially if

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,170
you're kind of career passing them on

00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:43,240
your direction we don't work with very

00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,120
many contractors anymore unless we need

00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,740
to and again we do the same onboarding

00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,080
process we give them the first date

00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,580
checklist and we go through a bit of an

00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,330
onboarding process of the other team

00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,500
members get to know this person

00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,970
sometimes we do like a 20-hour week

00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,590
we'll see how they work if they work

00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,060
well bring them to 40 and then if they

00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,610
do well we'll bring them on full-time

00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:06,820
and that process there gets them we kind

00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,300
of have some waters both ways so good

00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,890
question

00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:13,470
start with job descriptions even if

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,470
you're not ready thank you thank you

00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:22,300
we kind of have some problems with

00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:25,740
people who I guess they appear to lack

00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:30,190
motivation and sort of curiosity and

00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:32,020
things that we feel kind of like make

00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,820
good developers you know people who

00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,350
actually ever want someone would like to

00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,000
show up to user group meeting or

00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:41,710
something like that

00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,330
and we're in a organization that very

00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,450
hard to get fired from let's just say

00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,590
that you know it's not it's not public

00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:51,970
it's definitely not the same kind of

00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:54,100
organization is yours so uh any ideas

00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,990
around kind of how to you know come on

00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,760
guys let's go yeah

00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,840
do they have I mean do you know about

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:05,080
their lives outside of work um yeah I

00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,090
mean yeah we do kind of yeah

00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,680
so sometimes people that might not be

00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:11,050
super stoked at work they're super

00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,280
stoked about something else yes so if

00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,690
you can find out what that something

00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,840
else is

00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:19,150
and you know maybe it's like a video

00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,920
game like Team Fortress 2 I don't know

00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm really not up and up on my video

00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,610
game but like maybe you can create like

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,620
incentive programs to be like oh you

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,940
know I know you're really stoked to go

00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,530
windsurfing this weekend

00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,900
so if we can maybe hit these targets

00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,820
that maybe you can take Friday afternoon

00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,380
off and go windsurfing or you can find

00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,360
things that more are more meaningful to

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,210
them because sometimes you can't really

00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,920
get a satisfied employee to engaged no

00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,750
matter how hard you try and those perks

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,310
you kind of have to be like okay this

00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:49,960
group was engaged and I think it's again

00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,700
being transparent with them and say like

00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,770
hey Jane

00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,460
we really like working with you but I

00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:59,620
feel like you think your job sucks why

00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,080
what why do you feel like your job sucks

00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:04,150
and they're like ho you think I think my

00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,740
job sucks oh I thought I was just giving

00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,900
status quo and nobody was noticing

00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,640
you're like it's okay if you think that

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,350
it sucks but I want to make it better

00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,120
so what does that look like for you and

00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:15,550
they'd be like oh well you know I really

00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,080
hate my commute so can I work from home

00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,790
one day a week and then you're then that

00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,620
might create more engagement but

00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,240
sometimes is just like asking them like

00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:26,710
what do you like to do outside or why

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,850
are you unhappy and again putting in

00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,680
those metrics even though it's hard to

00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:32,290
fire people they need a performance plan

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,590
if they are sucking yeah to say like and

00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:37,960
we do 360s so we get performance input

00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:41,200
from their direct manager from their

00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,930
peers and if possible a client and that

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,880
we have a 360 degree view of what

00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,100
they're doing it's not just me being emo

00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,230
agro CEO like the person's not doing

00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,640
well it's like okay I have a feeling

00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,990
that this person is not doing well let

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,260
that's for manager or let's us we're

00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:58,300
peers and it's a good it's like the

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,370
sandwich good yeah good and it's not

00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,950
necessarily people see it coming they're

00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:05,230
like oh it's good I have pretty much

00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,810
like you get the 360s you put it

00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:10,870
together and you go look we have to have

00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:14,590
a difficult conversation I think that

00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:16,480
you know X Y Z is not working why do you

00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,680
think it might not be working and if

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,510
they can start to be like oh I'm a

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,370
problem who's ultimately if they're

00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,870
really unhappy they'd quit but they're

00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,360
there for some reason and it might be

00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:27,099
the money's to go windsurfing so just

00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,839
having that conversation might like

00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:31,599
bring some clarity for that and then

00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:33,700
helping with you know HR or some manager

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,640
to facilitate those higher conversations

00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,249
and sometimes it's good to play good pop

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,049
back up you know and and someone comes

00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:42,009
in is like okay this is you know this is

00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:43,660
where we're going and then another

00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:44,829
person comes in says well that must have

00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,920
been really difficult for you are you

00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:50,579
doing okay how can we support you okay

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,579

00:51:52,499 --> 00:52:03,400
now with magic dust pixilated okay well

00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:05,109
if you are a larger organization I do

00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,700
want to plug to know your company is

00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:08,349
something that we would love to use as a

00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,299
tool it's just not thinking that we're

00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:13,150
not big enough for it but it's a really

00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:15,430
cool tool that allows you to like $100

00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:17,589
per employee for their entire life and

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,180
it sends out these welcome emails it's

00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:21,999
really a fantastic tool I highly

00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,710
recommended I highly recommend hey taco

00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:26,499
if anybody knows and any other weird

00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,910
gimmicky things as generally you know

00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,839
something fun to share them I'm always

00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:39,779
open to ideas

00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:39,779

00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,460
