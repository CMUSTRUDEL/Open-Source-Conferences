Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Dependency Injection in PHP and Drupal
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Dependency Injection sounds like a fancy term for something complicated and advanced. After all, most people didn’t start hearing about this until recently when the PHP world was overtaken by object oriented programming. Dependency Injection sounds intimidating, but it is not. It is simple to understand and once you do, using it in PHP and Drupal is very easy.

In this session, you will learn what Dependency Injection is and how it helps you structure your programs better. You will learn some very basic concepts like constructor injection with analogies and examples and then move on to see how it is done in real life.

Most times, dependency injection is implemented with containers. You will learn how to use some simple dependency injection containers like Pimple in your PHP application. You will also learn how dependency injection is implemented in frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. We will focus on Symfony the most since Drupal uses Symfony’s dependency injection container.

By the end of the session, you will understand:

What is Dependency Injection and how does it help us
Constructor and setter injection
Why do we need Dependency Injection Containers
How to use Dependency Injection in simple PHP applications and frameworks like Laravel
How to use Dependency Injection in Symfony and Drupal 8
How to write YAML files to define services and their dependencies

good so I just want to give a quick

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,859
background of Who am I I'm selling

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,490
product I services for about 15 years

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,759
now not Google I've been in other

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,949
businesses used to be

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,770
MSDN Rd or Microsoft Regional Director

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,230
for Microsoft for about five or four

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,050
years a lot of evangelizing out there

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,560
and hence a lot of roadshows talking to

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,969
many customers demoing a lot of stuff i

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,320
co-founded a company which was primarily

00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:35,940
mobile first using drupal in the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,510
background that's where I got introduced

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,110
to group about four years five years ago

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,809
that's where we started off currently

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,800
working and co-founding IT solutions we

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:54,930
are the 100 people shop 30-yard focus on

00:00:49,800 --> 00:01:00,570
rupal and have San Jose as well as India

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:04,080
offices of this a quick point just want

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,420
to cover what are topics which we're

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,439
going to cover here product type

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,049
services what is required to create a

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,250
car type services how can it be

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,080
structured can you put a price to it or

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,869
how do you market the products or

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,909
services because all of these are sort

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,180
of cascading effects if you don't do the

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,180
first you won't be able to do the last

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,450
and before we moved a little I just

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,689
wanted to give a quick idea behind where

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,509
are we going with this so whatever we

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,880
can do well there are three things so

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,490
what we do well what we want to do and

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,240
what they are paid to do they are all

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:52,259
intersected at a certain point and we

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,350
have to adjust if all three points join

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,380
together obviously we're making a lot of

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,020
money there but I'm not sure if

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,880
everybody is intersecting at all three

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,040
angles out there

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,439
there are going to be gaps we're

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,970
predicting revenue is obviously going to

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,660
be a challenge a pair of services only

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,210
company

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,280
if you're a product only company you

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,380
don't know what how do I make more money

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,140
by doing a product and service come

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,080
service or something so kind of in a

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:27,970
dilemma if you've been in the business

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,490
for a long how many how much can you

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,840
really go and anticipate for the next

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,940
three four years I'm going to make this

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,400
much amount of money I don't think so

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,790
so to avoid or sort of to get out of

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,340
this is how you you can actually work on

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,300
how do you prioritize the service

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,040
so why product angle service please

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,340
raise your hand if you beat through this

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,520
scenario five phone calls you've had as

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,940
with a prospect to meeting in person

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,110
that is plea proposal rewrites because

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:08,400
he is going through a lot of definition

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,200
of how things work in front of us you

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,880
spend close to sixty five minutes and

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:20,250
you've not been able to sign the deal

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,250
how many of us have into that process

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,200
the I essentially behind this is how do

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,810
I increase my predictability in terms of

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,370
revenue because that's going to be the

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,900
bottom line for the company which I'm

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,090
driving or the employees which I'm going

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,890
to be along with me were planning to

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,280
scale with me but I don't know how do I

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,510
project this over the number of years

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,770
how do you differentiate against

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,740
competition so for us being a offshore

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,900
vendor if I go and sells hourly basis

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,290
consulting there are tons of those guys

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,410
already available if I can offer a

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,480
specific of offering and say if your

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,700
customers having this particular problem

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,250
I can go and solve because I've already

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,090
defined those specs so I don't have to

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,950
go and tell them hey mister customer ID

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,020
I know what you do what you're going

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,790
through I have solved these problems in

00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,790
the past here is how I'm going to do it

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,860
focus on one problem and I will talk

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,490
about how do you sort of shortlist on

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,550
those problems and end with one solution

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,169
sell value not just time most of us in

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,320
the drupal business have been actually

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:40,090
selling hourly basis consulting and of

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,800
course some of you are also being adding

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,130
value to your customers but can you

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,040
really maximize order by selling value

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:52,360
and not just by the time so that's the

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,460
perspective here an asset who knows

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,520
after few years you may be able to sell

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,930
that asset and make more money or effort

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,630
maybe some other company comes by and

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,880
says looks like this guy has this tool

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,520
or this company has its tools which can

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,880
add significant value to my revenue just

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,229
go ahead and buy that so that might be a

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
additional revenue angle if you are

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,080
thinking about that which in an hourly

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,000
consulting that's unlikely to happen I

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,949
sell it to focus groups better chance of

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,820
success I'll talk about how do you phone

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,639
on on to a particular group and then

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,380
sell that those kind of approaches so

00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,820
what is required to create a product a

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:36,520
service basically lists all the projects

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,860
which you have done get them into a

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,080
single bucket and then start filtering

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,289
what is common between all these

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,240
projects and I'll talk is talk about

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,120
some of our examples which we have been

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,020
through I'm sure you know we can talk

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,900
about some of yours as well identify

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,280
who's your buyer who's the decision

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,800
maker who's going to sign the check

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,580
who's going to approve the budget who

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,449
who are all these guys and why are those

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,460
required I'll talk about that and then

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,860
the time spent on the proposals how much

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,050
how much of an effort have you actually

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,690
put in to build those proposals and

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,090
winning the division of course executing

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,639
those projects as well and and the last

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,949
which is the most important part is you

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,660
need to be ready to invest if you are

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,640
building a product a service and

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,580
one of the diagrams which I'm going to

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,050
show later that will probably sort of

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,540
describe why should that be happen so

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,080
product I service you have features

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,890
fixed of a particular solution you have

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,630
you put a price to it you have prospects

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,730
identified of the personas with some

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,360
party members and then you go ahead and

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:55,480
create a product or service so how can

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,240
it be structured you arrive at a

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,820
baseline by gathering all projects as I

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,650
was talking about figured out what are

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,510
the common elements what is the common

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,610
value which you are delivering it to the

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:12,880
customer is there a particular value

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,570
which the customer is taking you for

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,630
granted

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,160
versus it's a perceived value so you

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,140
know there are two different aspects

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,640
which you have to think about and at the

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,410
important element when you're trying to

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,030
create your own product type service

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,910
identify an ideal client or total

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,690
accessible market for marketing jargon

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:39,660
from accessibility perspective just want

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:45,250
to quickly ask who who understands Pam

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:49,240
who doesn't understand time okay so the

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,930
idea behind the total actual market is

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,150
if you figured out let's say within

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,430
healthcare companies if your product or

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,370
service is focused on on a particular

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,410
healthcare segment within healthcare

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,940
segment which are the companies which

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,570
are likely to buy your product or

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,280
service and that would be the segment or

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,620
the market size which you are going to

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,960
attack and within that how many people

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,050
are likely to buy so you sort of drive

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,600
down into or zone down into your

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,370
sellable market and then go approach

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,070
them with specific offerings which

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,260
you're coming out with how do you price

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,560
it because that's also an important

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:35,050
element because if somebody is buying a

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,820
product I the first question he or she

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,479
is going to ask is what's the price of

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,610
the product

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,730
and and deriving a price is always going

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,740
to be a challenge because you don't have

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,079
a baseline there there is nobody else

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,170
who has a ready to use product or even

00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:56,620
if they are you obviously would want to

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,850
undercut or over add depending upon how

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,190
your product or service actually is

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,709
perceived by of respect so those are

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,550
some of the aspects like you either

00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:11,709
derive it by how much cost are you

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,329
incurring to build that product and then

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,100
add margins on to that and then

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:20,620
distribute that across your customers

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,300
add maybe a little bit of margins again

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,519
on top of them that could be one

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,269
approach the other approach is if you

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,630
have already sold these solutions may

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:33,430
not be productized solutions what's the

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,529
total value of the project or an average

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,449
value of the project you know that could

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:43,510
also be a consideration for putting a

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:46,060
price to your product or service pricing

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,820
asana cases we've already covered the

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,769
last part is about the marketing aspect

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:57,459
similar to a quick check on though I

00:09:50,769 --> 00:10:02,320
mean when you are trying to approach

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:07,779
your prospects in terms of trying to

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,120
sell the service one product can

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,880
actually be applied to multiple

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,850
prospects but the language which they

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,390
understand would always be different so

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,850
you have to create sort of I you know

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,959
messages which is coming down to the

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,120
same solution but the way it has

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,709
perceived or the way the first prospect

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,779
understands is always going to be

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:36,160
different so you have to create those

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,839
similar sounding messages so what I am

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,699
referring here is create different

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,610
versions of the problem so if the

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:45,130
problem is let me take that as an

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,220
example let's say healthcare company is

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,490
trying to fail

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,940
a patient intake form

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,130
now the farms fields within the farms

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,120
are pretty much the same for almost all

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:02,990
hospitals and clinics but the way the

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,840
CIO perceives his problem versus the CTO

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,030
or the CMOS achievement medical officer

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,280
but sees that problem is totally

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,370
different so you need to have a separate

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,290
message for all these personas and then

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,430
reach out to those guys that's something

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,130
which you can do position as a problem

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,620
solver so the questions would always go

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,170
as hey do you want to improve your

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,350
patients experience it's a very broad

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,960
level question but the ultimate goal is

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,360
for them to create those patient intake

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,640
forms whenever that patient walks in he

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,110
signs up on that particular time and

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,030
that's the product which would

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,990
essentially go and sell to all the

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:47,990
hospitals I wanted to spend a lot of

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,540
time on the marketing aspect but that'll

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,760
be a whole lot of different session all

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,650
together on how do you pick up a product

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,250
and start market marketing it out to

00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:00,950
different prospects this is something

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:06,320
which you should not do it's a cottage

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:08,390
ham trying to depict art at the point

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:15,980
where I was referring to about

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:21,260
investment if you are paid by our

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:24,560
service and assuming you have recurring

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,230
business coming in and you know that for

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,630
months or years together this customers

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,350
honest I can scale my business along

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:37,210
with that customers are these customers

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,210
that the growth is you have

00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:45,319
but if you are trying to create a

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:51,919
product type service you are bound to in

00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:53,779
where an inflection point for the peak

00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,169
of time when you actually make more

00:12:53,779 --> 00:13:00,589
money then what your paper serves pay by

00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:02,299
our service is going to make having said

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:07,509
that there is always a fit for your

00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:13,099
website on both sides this can we climb

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:16,429
and we're essentially not making enough

00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:19,999
money as you would have been in just by

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:22,899
being doing a consulting work so you

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,819
have to sort of think about both aspects

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,369
so sort of word of caution before you

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,969
figure that it's going to be very easy

00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:35,869
it's not and I'll talk about what's not

00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:39,529
great about that if you already saw this

00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:43,839
idea to some of your time they may not

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:46,039
like that that you have now created a

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,549
service offering which has boundary

00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:52,729
around it because you actually built

00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:55,249
them sort of already from the customer

00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:59,479
so that's not you know they may not like

00:13:55,249 --> 00:14:02,539
that it requires a lot of work because

00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:05,359
you're defining a feature you are

00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:09,229
setting up things you're making sure

00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:11,299
that you know you're talking to

00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:13,419
prospects figuring out what feature

00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,799
works for them what doesn't and so forth

00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:19,009
so that's something which you have to

00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,479
sort of create that and it can't be done

00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:24,199
overnight with a lot of people people

00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:27,499
perceive it can be but it's not package

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:31,669
it to convey great value and be

00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:33,259
profitable so it's sort of a dilemma a

00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,030
lot of times when you're talking to

00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,000
multiple

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,400
some customers with this you know bring

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,320
the value and also be profitable so

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,090
that's something which you have to think

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,700
about these are two approaches which you

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,470
can actually take a think we have

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,560
actually taken both and I want to talk

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,720
about that there's an inside-out

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,800
approach where bunch of our customers

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,800
had multiple websites media companies

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,380
very specifically where they had a

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,570
Drupal website at WordPress website they

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,670
had a RoR or Ruby based websites and

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,310
they had two people for each of these

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:19,210
sites maintaining which the cost of that

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:22,330
you know was significantly high can I

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,230
clear a overarching solution which I can

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,970
manage all three of them all three web

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,330
properties and they were acquiring two

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,820
more under one single umbrella so we

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,480
call it the central admin panel and

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:42,220
that's the solution which we've created

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,250
which is live right now sort of 70 to 80

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,430
percent it's already there

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,530
why because the backend solution is

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,690
pretty much the same it's just a you

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,490
know fetch an API from different

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,350
websites and start throwing in from

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,930
asset management user management

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,960
perspective the reason why it's not

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:05,530
hundred percent is every customer

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,930
requires a different UI and says you

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,720
know is the way it's managed internally

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,000
within my system it should give the same

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,830
look and feel so that my admin guys are

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,140
not running around and there's no extra

00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,140
training required so that's the aspect

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,780
where it's 70 70 to 80% frozen and the

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,480
rest Sept 20 to 30% is where we go ahead

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,310
and define the UI or the customer goes

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,800
and defines the UI so it depends upon

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,350
how big the shop is in a dress

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,839
accordingly so we figure - who's the guy

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,960
we should supposed to sell what are the

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,680
features what is the price and I've

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:44,420
purposely not put up right here so that

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,580
that's an inside-out approach because we

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,430
built those solutions already for

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,160
multiple of our customers we know what

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,350
goes into this

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,910
create an overarching solution fixed

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,800
features in terms of users what

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,230
properties are we looking for and so and

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,430
so forth is an inside-out approach an

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,980
outside-in

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:11,690
approaches where we knew that there is a

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:15,650
problem in the industry and can a distro

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,780
or a product solve that problem and who

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,610
are the likely candidates to whom we can

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:25,280
sell this and can it be a feature fixed

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,530
you know challenges around patient

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,400
intake forms most of the time is hey can

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,080
I go integrate with EHRs and I know how

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,430
many people are in healthcare domain

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,410
operating or care 3 so they maybe I

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,690
should skip this part but the idea is

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,900
the first question they're likely to ask

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,630
is can it integrate with my system and

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:51,800
if yes how easy is it or how difficult

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:54,590
is it going to be 100% frozen in terms

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,960
of heaters because we know what the

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,150
forms are most of the times defined by a

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,640
CMS it's a central body for health care

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,670
regulations so we've known that those

00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,030
are pretty much fixed and hence we went

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,550
ahead and created distro which is free

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,980
available on v7 v8 has going to be

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,470
released this week by end of this week

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,120
so those the stores are already in now

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,720
how do we make money or of this because

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,000
destroy is free any integration work

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,640
that's where we come in because we've

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,910
been doing integration for 4 years now

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,620
and hence that's the value we bring in

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:37,850
the revenue which we make out of that so

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:40,360
some of our estimation tools sorry some

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,240
of our product ID services so we have a

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,000
estimation and sprint automation tools

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,490
essentially every shop has lot of Excel

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,360
sheets or maybe have an internal tool to

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,690
do estimation for projects we've learned

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,150
from over the years how

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,070
difficult or challenging from a

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,890
complexity creation could be your

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,570
resource allocation could be there is a

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,970
demand from the customer most of the

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:11,650
time here can you share the whole sprint

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,540
plan with me or you know a generic plan

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,630
before you even start executing the

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,140
project or get my bunion on that so we

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:23,050
created that automation tool then the

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,590
patient in text form I talked about we

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,620
also attempted a d6 to d7 migration but

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,110
we sort of thought that there is not

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,090
enough demand and it's sort of shelled

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,510
right now it's still on but we are not

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,010
aggressively talking about that

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,860
multi-site multi a publishing framework

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:45,460
so we worked with large publishing

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,160
companies they've had issues where I

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,010
need to create a site and a mobile app

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,550
within two weeks a site somebody

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,350
understands but mobile apps within two

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,460
weeks it's going to be a challenge

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,500
especially every customer needs a new UI

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,750
or hey I want

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,850
I owe s but I don't want Android or I

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,050
want those or I just want Android

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,940
depending upon what they're looking for

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:15,280
so we created a framework which word

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:19,600
spin off this website and the mobile

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,850
life within two days dumped in the

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,400
framework capture all the data which is

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,460
their spin it out the only challenge

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,330
with iOS is it will take another two

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,910
weeks to get approval from Apple apart

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,310
from that that's something which is

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,380
fairly flexible in terms of creating

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:43,300
this framework and central admin panel I

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:48,060
talked about quickly to summarize try

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:52,170
and standardize your processes tools

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:56,650
methodology if you have to create a

00:20:52,170 --> 00:21:00,550
product type service if you want to

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,860
deliver value you have to you know have

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,570
to make sure that there are you're

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,340
focusing on a limited amount of

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,039
customers

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,980
but you maximize your revenue that's the

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:15,539
good part and then promote and sell

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,799
figure out what your throat electable

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:21,779
marketers also predict your revenue or

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,440
you can predict your revenue based on

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,840
hey I know out of my thousand times when

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,240
I said a thousand my thousand prospects

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,519
in the total axis of market I were able

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,679
to sell it to ten and like you to

00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,960
replicate this to another five or ten

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,960
twenty and that's how you can actually

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,879
predict your revenue versus the services

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,100
which you have been selling so those are

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:50,159
some of the aspects these are some of

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:55,590
undone with my sort of discussion here

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,419
open to answer any questions how to I'm

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,679
good on time I think I have more five

00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,749
minutes to go any questions anybody

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,490
already thinking about prioritizing your

00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:07,490
service facing a particular challenge

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:23,350
so we actually are building a foundation

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,140
like for a grant management system for

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,800
foundations and we had already some

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:34,710
clients on a Drupal 6 version of it and

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:39,070
then our clients agreed to pay us to

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:42,940
bring it to Drupal 8 and then we had

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:46,360
them pay us over three years they have

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,100
to pay us like maybe like 50 grand a

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,900
year to like have a whole new same

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,060
Drupal 8 and then they're also kind of

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,740
in the model so they know we're going to

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,590
try to sell it to other people and then

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,210
they get a small cut if we sell to other

00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,890
people because they can also help us

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,500
sell it to other people because they are

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,660
already in the market so now we're just

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,890
really trying to figure out B so we're

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,160
lucky that we kind of had somebody to

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,440
pay to create the product part but now

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,930
we have to figure out how to price it

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,680
and market it and sell it I guess one of

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,720
our biggest problems is we tend to we

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,400
have lot developers and like we don't

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,820
really have you know people with

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,470
experience like selling products and

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,690
like getting that out there so that's

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:33,370
what we're trying to figure out now yeah

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:35,260
I think we've had a similar I would say

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,660
challenge but a business proposal out

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,860
here and the way we figured out was that

00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:44,500
if our customer can sell on our behalf

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,210
because as you said they would like you

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,390
to reach out to that prospect base is

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,190
much better so let them do the front-end

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,740
part and then you do the backend part

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,440
that is one approach and it's sort of

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,660
working for us in where we are a

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,760
professional services partner for the

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,160
product and they are the selling partner

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,700
for the product so it's a buy-in or a

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,240
skin in the game for

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,240
any other question

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,500
sort of it might be a two-part question

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:17,350
what's your take on creating a Minimum

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,170
Viable Product prototype first yeah so

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,750
it's always a good idea that's how we've

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:27,100
been going about it so the patient

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:29,110
intake form is exactly a MVP it's not a

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,030
full-fledged products because we knew

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,580
that it is always going to be a

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,950
challenge when people deploy it in that

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,080
location because the distro but then the

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,520
next step is always going to be hey can

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,890
you integrate with epic can you

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,500
integrate with so-and-so EHR or my

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:47,530
billing application and that's why we've

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,690
torn down the whole scenario down to

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,090
okay we'll just give you palms

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,580
that's an MVP and then you can take it

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,440
further if you want to okay that's a

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,240
good approach I say because I don't know

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,910
if you do any customer discovery if this

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,160
is a Lean Startup and if so do you do

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:07,270
the MVP before or after you interview

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,140
your customers so that is for when you

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:14,320
build product for a startup company it's

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,990
not a product I service per se okay it's

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,050
a product where you know your teacher

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,780
Lister's or wishlist is this big but you

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:25,060
figure out that's the maximum number of

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,740
people who are going to use and scale

00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,000
over a period of time that's the

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,010
featureless which you won't want to

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,350
create and we do that for our healthcare

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,790
business by the way where a lot of

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,500
customers come in and say I can you

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,490
build as well as a for us so can you

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,340
build this population health management

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,530
for us safe Emma what's your wish list

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,590
and then they come out with use cases

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:46,960
and say okay this will take two years no

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,120
no we don't have that much time come it

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,940
down to three months four months this is

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,830
the MVP these are your prospects they

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,300
might come back to you say I need this

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,640
feature and that reason and then

00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,640
progressed a little okay thank you

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:10,559
maybe else oh three minutes I have looks

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,600
like sure so I'm curious um my team's

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,880
spent time building a product b2b

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,789
e-commerce platform that hooks into an

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,399
ERP and we're having this problem where

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:21,929
we're we've released it for 12 customers

00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,100
we kind of went through a lean process

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,500
and now we're getting new customers

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,600
they're asking for features that are way

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,330
more cumbersome and not valuable to

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,279
prospects so how do you what's your

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,190
methodology for saying no to those

00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,419
customers and pushing them away well I

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,330
would say yes to them but it would be

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:44,220
additional custom job which needs to be

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,190
done because if if all these features

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,380
are across common across most of your

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,630
customers then you may want to invest

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,370
that and then distribute your cost get

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,580
more money in yeah but if it's very

00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,350
specific requirement of a customer and

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,899
say okay this is what comes out of the

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,049
box for ending apart from that you're

00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:07,230
going to be charged extra so see you say

00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:11,010
yes to everything not everything yeah

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:14,370
where 90 percent of times I said yes now

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,470
but sometimes I have to say no because I

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,080
know that that customer is not going to

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,720
go anywhere because it's already using

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,340
my platform but I want to maintain that

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,590
relationship with them and hence I would

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,380
say no I can't do this maybe somebody

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,450
else I can find and say can you go ahead

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,419
and help them out and just on top of

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:37,620
that do you open your system up and then

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,149
allow outside vendors to perhaps be a

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,100
partner to that customer maybe there's

00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:42,870
some of the my team can't do but so the

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,539
patient in big farm I thought about yeah

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:48,390
it's a destroyer as I said anybody can

00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:51,830
deploy it and go ahead and expand if

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:55,770
they require so in certain cases yes and

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:59,470
certain cases now Cassius thanks

00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:02,260
yep good thanks thank you everyone

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,390
[Applause]
