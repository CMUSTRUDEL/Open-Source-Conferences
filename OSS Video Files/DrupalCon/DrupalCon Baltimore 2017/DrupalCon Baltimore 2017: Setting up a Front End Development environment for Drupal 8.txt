Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Modern theming is getting more and more complex. This session will walk you through the steps to setup your theme development environment in Drupal 8. Topics will include many of the standard things that you need to do to set up a new theming environment in Drupal 8, so you don't have to work it out yourself!

gulp
sass
twig templates
theme .yml files
settings.php (and settings.local.php)
services.yml
debugging twig
gitignore
drush
composer
and more!


This session is for an intermediate audience. It should appeal to developers new to Drupal, "back end" Drupal developers who want to know more about setting up environments for theming, and those who have basic CSS and HTML knowledge and want to setup a new Drupal environment, and advanced-beginners who want to jump in to the details. 

This is intended to provide attendees with a detailed checklist to set up a new Drupal front end environment.
