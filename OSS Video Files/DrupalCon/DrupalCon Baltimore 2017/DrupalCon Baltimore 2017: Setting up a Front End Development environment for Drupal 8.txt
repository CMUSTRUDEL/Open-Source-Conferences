Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Setting up a Front End Development environment for Drupal 8
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Modern theming is getting more and more complex. This session will walk you through the steps to setup your theme development environment in Drupal 8. Topics will include many of the standard things that you need to do to set up a new theming environment in Drupal 8, so you don't have to work it out yourself!

gulp
sass
twig templates
theme .yml files
settings.php (and settings.local.php)
services.yml
debugging twig
gitignore
drush
composer
and more!


This session is for an intermediate audience. It should appeal to developers new to Drupal, "back end" Drupal developers who want to know more about setting up environments for theming, and those who have basic CSS and HTML knowledge and want to setup a new Drupal environment, and advanced-beginners who want to jump in to the details. 

This is intended to provide attendees with a detailed checklist to set up a new Drupal front end environment.

Drupal 8 I'm Kristin Bradham I'm also

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:14,140

company so if they need some help I come

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,080
out of the woodwork and help and I've

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,430
been doing web stuff forever my talk

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,970
today is going to be a lot about

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,800
command-line tools and as I like to joke

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,950
with some of my younger colleagues I

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,780
remember when the two-man line was the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:23,729
computer so I've been doing computer

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,880
sustance you know I was eight and that

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:30,419
was a lot of years ago and I don't say

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,220
anymore because I just don't have to but

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,639
I've been doing Drupal for almost five

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,700
years

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,160
couple months i but and once I found

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,620
rupal I really like this space I really

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,630
love the community I love the support I

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,770
love the group I love the people that

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,180
I've met through this and this type of

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,740
work and I have three kids and two dogs

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,030
if you want to talk to me later I would

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,190
love to talk to you about my kids and my

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,020
dogs if you have dogs I will talk to you

00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,910
all day I will probably remember your

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,580
dog's name and will not remember your

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:08,370
name so and why did I take this subject

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,760
so boring right Hey from an environment

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,710
for a truthful wait so boring yet all of

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,510
us start here we all have to do this we

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,720
have to get them in order we have to get

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,920
our environment in line before we can do

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,420
any developing

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,030
just to be very clear about what this

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,790
talk is about I don't do any development

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:31,680
I just set you up to do development in

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,750
this talk the commit the front end has

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,850
more command-line tools now than the

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,860
back end does and this has been a major

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,470
shift that we've seen in the last three

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,080
to four years in front-end development

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,530
the front-end development has taken off

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,530
we now have all sorts of different ops

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,680
tools and we are working more and more

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,480
on the command line eight we have gone

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,300
from front end being your graphic

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,640
designer you're just CSS I just know CSS

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,950
and HTML to really being full of

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,990
programmers who know a heck of a lot

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,400
about JavaScript and need to organize

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,890
ourselves because of it so we need a

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,850
checklist like I have every time I set

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,700
up a new environment

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,080
I need a checklist because each client

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,640
of mine sometimes we run aqueous

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,450
sometimes where I'm Pantheon sometimes

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,000
we're somewhere else

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,800
eh it seems like every single time I try

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,010
to setup my environment I need to go

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,660
through the checklist and make sure I am

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,150
you makes it setting up everything

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,220
correctly so this talk is as much for me

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,430
as it is for you I made myself a

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,570
checklist so the first things were the

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,250
first thing we're going to do that

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,900
there's four major parts of the talk

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,120
we're going to talk about general

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,190
environment set up Drupal eight set up

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,930
then we're going to stretch and yes I am

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,050
going to make you stand up so be ready

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,610
for that I'm giving you fair warning

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,370
then we're going to do a front-end dev

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,080
ops which is your gulp and things like

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,800
that and then we're going to talk about

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,060
a one part of front-end that's very

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,790
debatable right now and that's theme

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,120
structures and how we're structuring our

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,690
folders our files our selector names all

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,670
that that's where I'll get some people

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,580
questioning me at the end on what I

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,190
think is best and what you think is that

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,640
so general environment setup I'm going

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,380
to go through this part pretty quick and

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,820
but here's my checklist for what do I

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,340
have in my environment I need to make

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,430
sure I have my good editor my hosting is

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,830
set up MyMathLab set up install Drupal

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,670
dead modules permissions bash shell and

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,370
get

00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,690
so editor's this is pretty

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,150
straightforward most of you probably

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,590
have an editor that you prefer I say if

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,440
you like your editor stay with your

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:46,050
editor I've moved to phpstorm because

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,860
for Drupal I'm working in JavaScript I'm

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,680
working in swig I'm working in PHP and

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,780
PHP storm

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,580
supports all of that but coda and code

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,230
kit if you're straight front-end they

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,750
have some serious advantages and I do

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,660
and I do recommend that you take a look

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,880
at that but more important that which

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,390
editor is that you setup your editor for

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,590
Drupal coding standards okay a lot of

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,720
you raise your hand that this is your

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,480
first Drupal con Drupal coding standards

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,110
are very very important and what that

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,090
means is what your whitespace looks like

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,740
where what your syntax looks like and

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,050
how you format it and you can set up

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,570
your editor so it does it for you for

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,580
example I am going to save you about

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,880
three hours of my time right now by

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,700
saying dot yellow files require two or

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,400
multiple of two spaces to work not a tab

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,460
if you mess with up you will have a

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,320
white screen of death and it will take

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,450
you three hours of googling to figure

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,420
out or at least it did me my first time

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,520
so it's very very important now it's not

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,130
just what it looks like but especially

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,080
now that we're working with yellow files

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,910
get your spacing right or you will crash

00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,920
your site hosting this is just my list

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,290
of things that I get together for

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,840
hosting find your SSH keys and figure

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,280
out how they do SSH keys why this is so

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,250
difficult I don't know but this always

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,320
seems to take me forever and and then

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,820
find out what hosting specific tools

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,920
you're going to be using

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,530
there are boos here for all of these

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,260
people Pantheon Kalla box Acquia dev

00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,660
desktop they all have their own tools

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,210
they all have their own workflows they

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,700
have all kinds of wonderful things for

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,640
you so I I suggest I've worked with all

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,740
of these and they do change how your

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,390
environment is set up I baited with

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,020
myself on whether or not I wanted to go

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,880
through each one of these but honestly

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,800
like Pantheon is going to do a much

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,290
better job of presenting Pantheon

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,429
product than I am so but

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,929
though that this is going to be

00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,119
something that you'll have to set up and

00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,949
learn the workflow of if you're working

00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:58,319
on a big project with a number of

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:59,549
developers man's lamp I really only if

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,339
you're running your own local

00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:05,399
environment you need to set your memory

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,499
limit very very high and the reason for

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,289
this is for front-end developers when we

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:12,779
turn on twig debugging it's going to

00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:16,109
crash if it is not high enough

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,139
it takes twig debugging takes a lot of

00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:21,089
memories so just please before you even

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,369
try to start developing you're going to

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,999
save yourself a lot of time if you go

00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:29,579
and set your memory limit high and other

00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:31,919
modules that I go on and I install

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,869
locally and just for myself and you can

00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,559
get ignore these if you don't want to

00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:40,709
push them up our devil develop devil

00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:45,629
developed in stage file proxy which

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:47,220
allows you to pull images from a live

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:49,589
website rather than having to have the

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,709
files on your local that for some of my

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:54,569
clients the files are you know hundreds

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,339
and hundreds of gigabytes so it's not

00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:58,589
realistic for me to have files on my

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,419
computer you might want to turn on the

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,539
style guide so you can see what you're

00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,399
developing really quick and then admin

00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,539
toolbar is just something I always turn

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:13,289
on um so now we've kind of set up Drupal

00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:15,209
and just every single time again it's

00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,439
this is just on my checklist we're going

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,329
through the checklist now the stuff

00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:20,489
super boring you've probably done it

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,139
once or twice but here you go remember

00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:27,509
to do this you've got to change your

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:29,879
file permissions and pro tip I am huge

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,769
again on the command line and a lot of

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,869
fun and developers are afraid of things

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,929
like this but I'm going to talk a little

00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:40,079
bit about bash aliases a bash alias is

00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:43,049
just you get to make a little tiny clip

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,999
like CBP and it runs a whole long

00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:46,619
command for you then you don't have to

00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,239
remember it later on you don't have to

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,479
write it down in documentation it's

00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:54,239
already in your aliases file ok so if

00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,939
when I type CDP into my gosh cell it

00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:59,030
runs this and changes my file

00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:03,320
permissions for me

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,420
so another permissions that you need to

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,850
make sure that you gather is air and

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,030
this is again every new client that I

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,700
get you need to log into the site make

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,860
sure that you have permission as an

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,540
admin so that you can edit and do things

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,080
that you need to do is on the site and

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,090
they you are not user one who here drush

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,580
leaves into their client site is user

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:31,760
one yes we do what we all do it okay

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:34,490
don't do that anymore the reason that I

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,770
say this is if you have your own user

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,840
things are tracked things are logged

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,780
they can't come back and say you did

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,750
things when you didn't okay if you're

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,030
just stressful Union as a user when it

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,350
becomes really hard to track who's doing

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:53,390
what and I'm going to come back to - are

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,850
see if you are a front-end developer and

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,950
you don't know what your boss RC is this

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,410
is your fight like this is your homework

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,380
okay go home and find out what your

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,660
batch RC is okay it's just a little tiny

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,520
file and in this file you can make

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,070
yourself all the shortcuts in the world

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,970
suddenly the 10-man line will be your

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,390
friend again okay and this is where my I

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,510
remember when the the computer was the

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:22,100
command line these these are these are

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,930
pretty straightforward things they've

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,030
been around for years there's lots of

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,000
documentation please go check out your

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,280
bachelor's see so you can see here my

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,930
batch RC has aliases just to change

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,640
directories that's the first one go to

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,920
my htdocs directory a second alias and

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:44,600
actually goes into Pantheon downloads a

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,760
database and puts it into a file okay so

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,070
I don't have to go to Pantheon and click

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,650
download the database and then go and

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,570
put it into the database and Aiden when

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,240
I want to do get a date database it's

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,070
actually two aliases for me okay

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,750
these are really powerful little tools

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,300
if you aren't using for the front end

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,820
please go look at these ups see what

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,480
other people are doing the last thing I

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,769
have here is a little a little bash

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,879
script that the the one is a

00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:18,220
rameters so when I type in s KITT then

00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,800
it's going to search my git branch for

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,319
all the get branches for whatever my

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,720
search whatever I type in after that so

00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:30,999
you can write little tiny snippets of

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:33,459
code really fast and this just anything

00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,610
when we talk about these are your

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:38,619
personal front-end dev tools that you

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,209
know that you have to do and you have to

00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,279
go and look at these commands over and

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,809
over again put them in here and then you

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,110
won't you won't have to search for them

00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:50,319
and you won't have to type as much okay

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,529
yeah I debated whether to even put this

00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:55,720
on here but it's important that you put

00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:59,049
get in and more important like you're in

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,819
your git is not ignore file you you're

00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,529
ignoring your node modules we'll talk

00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,179
about why you get a bunch of node

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,179
modules but you don't want to check all

00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,459
that stuff in so you do need to create a

00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,889
git ignore file and ignore your

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,769
front-end files that you do not want to

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,829
check in for other developers that's

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:20,290
very important okay

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,389
so that was to start general like you

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,829
could use all of that for any site that

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,569
you're developing those weren't Drupal

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,259
some of them were Drupal specific but

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:30,339
here's some more specific to Drupal and

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,679
things that we have to go in and change

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,660
we pulled down our our local environment

00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,959
we pulled down our code now we need to

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,839
go and change our settings dot PHP our

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,279
services memo in order to debug twig I'm

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,679
going to talk a little bit about yamo

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,360
files you need to make sure your dress

00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:53,980
is up and running and you might want to

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:56,679
use Drupal console so um who here has

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,649
edited their settings dot PHP file

00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,480
directly yeah okay so that's all the

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,759
back-end developers and some of the

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,470
front-end developers you you really

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,480
should be making a settings that local

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,709
about PHP again then you can put

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,289
whatever you want in there you're not

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,260
going to step on anybody else's toes so

00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:15,789
the settings that PHP is for generated

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,669
when you set up scruple and everyone

00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,169
shares it you can turn on settings at

00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:22,360
local so it'll just point to that you

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:24,839
put your own settings in there and then

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,490
you put your local database and more of

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,789
certainly for us front-end people you

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,950
can disable CSS of JSF aggregation there

00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:34,860
so you don't have to go into the Gilly

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,870
and keep turning office if that's what

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,279
you need to do and then when you pull

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,710
it's not going to turn that off with

00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,390
other people's config either because now

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,700
with Drupal 8 we're passing config

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:49,049
around as well right so so it's

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,970
important that you do this here services

00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:53,370
dot yeah Mille it works kind of the same

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,169
way you can make a services locally mo

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,789
but make sure you put that in your get

00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:02,399
ignore file and you want you can go

00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:05,159
through your services tip find graph

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:07,230
this twig debug you'll just make you can

00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,330
make just a services yell that has just

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,450
this little code in it and you'll turn

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,980
twinky bug on ok but services that looks

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,500
about yellow and that way again you're

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,850
not editing the shared file the services

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,140
that you animal but everybody's using

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:24,120
you're just doing it for yourself then

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,010
in your twig files once you've done this

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,630
again this is I'm giving you guys a lot

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,640
of homework I'm not going through

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,950
step-by-step how to do everything I

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,039
think you can google just as well as I

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,990
can right so a lot of these are like ok

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,960
make sure you do this and if you need

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,029
more help go google it but in your twig

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,070
files you'll be able to put these two

00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:46,919
once you turn all these things on you'll

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,570
be able to put these two commands into

00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,299
your twig files to get more information

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,500
about what's available in your twig

00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:57,809
files ok remember no development yet

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,520
we're just we're just turning on our

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:06,690
development tool ok and yellow files are

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:10,549
something new in Drupal 8 and who here

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:14,309
remembers how many spaces for demo files

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:17,100
challenge two spaces two faces two

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,940
spaces no tabs two spaces or you will

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,409
break your site and yeah I this I I was

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,090
so frustrated when I figured this out I

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,490
was like you have to be kidding me I put

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:31,020
in an extra space and like I place the

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,850
whole site so so this is you but most

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,890
important are you see my info dot llamo

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,180
is going to have your region and now we

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,040
have demo files that we can pass them

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,540
things like breakpoints because now we

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,650
don't have a duty for breakpoints it has

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,000
to be in a llamo file and and it's most

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,920
commonly used for images and pictures

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,360
but most friend people are going to know

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:56,470
what their theme that breakpoints like a

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:58,330
mole is went the wrong way and seemed

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,070
out library side mammal is another

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,700
really big shift that's happened in

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:07,090
Drupal 8 that's really fantastic ok you

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,580
can you can load libraries now you're

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,230
not jet loading jQuery globally you're

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,200
going to just have this little yamo file

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,380
you can load jQuery back there you can

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,090
load any other CSS JavaScript source

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,350
anything you want in this little yellow

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,570
file and here's an example of that so

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,340
for the global library it looks like

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,170
this if you want to create a library

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,680
just for a specific page and load it

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:35,980
there you can you can do it here but get

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,840
really really interested in libraries

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,200
your libraries that yellow file because

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,480
there's a lot of power there and if you

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,830
need jQuery this way you turn on so and

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,820
finally again Drupal 8 specific dress

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,170
we're now setting up the dress with

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,750
composer we're doing lots of other

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,480
things with composer so you do need to

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,850
learn composer and how to install things

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,940
with composer and so drush is a nice a

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,620
nice intro step into that composers

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,660
becoming more and more of a part of

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:12,310
Drupal 8 installs and there's also

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,700
different ways to use multiple versions

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:20,020
of drush if you look on the hook 42

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:23,950
website we have an article by Jeff about

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,480
that Drupal console and I was really

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,730
Drupal console resistant I'm

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,970
command-line but I'm like really another

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,820
one but jubu console has some really

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,730
great things for us steamers like GT

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,430
generate a theme so it's right there you

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,260
just generate your little theme file and

00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,660
all your dot yellow files and it just

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,950
makes a little folder for you and this

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,430
just made me extremely happy

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,750
so let's go alergy book console it is

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,490
worth the time ok

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,809
so this part I'm gonna make you see us

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,659
since we got halfway through everybody

00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:59,659
stand up and stretch and if you didn't

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:02,200
want to casseon says you have to anybody

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,200
gets uh Joe

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,010
[Laughter]

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:34,850
okay who thinks I'm talking too fast

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:36,110
no one okay that was my the last time I

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,970
gave this speech they're like you did

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:44,780
not take a bribe so oh good so everybody

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:49,730
stretched out and this is K 2 SL I love

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:52,160
chase us oh he is snarky just love he's

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:56,360
just me but since this is if you want to

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,400
see my avatar that's it um all right so

00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,150
now the probably this is the part you

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,130
guys all paid for

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,870
ok so we got through the checklist of

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,490
all the Drupal 8 stuff we got through

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,550
all the like okay we did our bash

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,320
aliases and course settings on PHP you

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,720
know service but like all that super

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,700
boring stuff now we get into what is

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,160
really fun for the front end people okay

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,950
so we get into the front end DevOps and

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,800
this is them this is again exploded in

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,800
the last few years maybe two and a half

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,430
years three years ago we were all like

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:31,460
grunt wrenches up it's come easy you

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,710
know and now brunch is over okay they

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,120
set the grunts gone I am going to talk

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,940
about breath because you might inherit

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,600
rent to steams things do stand around

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,700
for more than two years amazingly enough

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,640
but this is this is a ever changing

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,760
landscape and I actually had a lot of

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,800
requests from back-end developers for

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,900
this part because they would ask me

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,520
questions like what is no jazz so some

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,920
of this for you front-end developers is

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,810
going to be you know stuff you are know

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,000
and you can correct me later when I make

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,310
mistakes but for the back end developers

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,620
and there's some definite information

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,840
you'll need here so when I'm setting up

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,430
my front end dev environment I'm going

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,970
to set up nodejs

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,970
NPM gulp version control sass sass to it

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,090
why and a lot of what we're going to

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,910
talk about is task runners ok so when we

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,650
talk about front-end what what how you

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,909
speak to and when we talk about

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,889
front-end dev ops we we are going to

00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:39,710
a lot about task runners which is gulp

00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:45,080
ride things that do things for us kind

00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:48,470
of like aliases but on speed so why a

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,119
task runner and why do we need test

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,779
runner first of all because we all love

00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:55,460
this thing called fast right sass is a

00:24:52,779 --> 00:25:00,340
fantastic innovation in what we're doing

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:04,369
with CSS that makes it more available to

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,259
to make larger and larger sites with you

00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:09,229
know crazy things we should have had in

00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:10,249
CSS earlier on like and I'm thinking I

00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:13,190
can't even think of the right word but

00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:19,099
you know dollar fine somebody help me

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:20,419
yeah variable safety sorry you get in

00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:22,580
front of you Thanks probably hundred

00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,409
fifty people in here and I get a little

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,049
get a little loopy

00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:28,849
so sass because of all those variables

00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,830
it requires compiling and watching

00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:33,470
compiling is an old computer thing right

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:37,369
like we don't compile on the web but

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:40,190
sass requires compiling and watching dot

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:42,139
now this is where you get into you want

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,849
the better front-end developers and the

00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:46,039
better front-end developers are the

00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:48,409
JavaScript developers and the JavaScript

00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:51,499
developers like to link to cat and

00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:53,720
uglify everything this is very different

00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:55,789
than again other things that we see web

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,210
but we want to do this we want to do it

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:01,909
right now and we we like our gulp for

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,009
doing that there's also some very big

00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:06,049
advantages to time live reload for

00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:07,489
example if you change your CSS it just

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,710
reload your browser for you so you don't

00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:11,899
have to go over and click reload reload

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,599
reload each time you make a small change

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:16,309
okay a task runner is going to do that

00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,320
for you

00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,090
a KSS style guide this is a an

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,669
alternative to things like pattern

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,519
Labatt's that comes out it requires a

00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:28,399
task runner regression testing you can

00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,470
do with a task runner so it's etc etc

00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,979
and so forth each front-end developer

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:37,099
has this list of repetitive tasks that

00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:39,950
we want to do and so we need a test

00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:43,010
winner okay

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:45,490
but before we can have a test runner we

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,350
have to install this thing called nodejs

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,690
what is no js' and I get asked this

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:54,470
fight more back-end developers who don't

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:58,580
do JavaScript that do PHP right this is

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:01,040
a huge framework nodejs is huge it's not

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,010
just for front-end hole applications are

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,470
written in nodes is okay no js' is a is

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,720
a whole other way to write with them

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,830
applications or actually applications

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,370
for all kinds of things I shouldn't say

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,340
what and but for us for us front-end

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,650
Drupal developers we just install it

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,630
because we want to install node packages

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,390
with it so people are writing these

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,610
little applications in nodes a s we want

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,940
to install those applications to do our

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:31,400
our busy tasks for us so that's what

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,250
nodejs is it's a huge framework we

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,590
install it so that we can use node

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,330
packages with the MA NPM some of the

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,680
more advanced front-end developers are

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,990
of course going to go and write their

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,000
own know packages but that's we're not

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:47,890
we're talking Drupal sphere here right

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,400
now this is this is what we do it for um

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:54,680
NSE M stands for node package manager so

00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,650
we just want these little applications

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,510
to pull in so that we can run all these

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:02,330
repetitive tasks that we want in the

00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,880
background and it's a large repository

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,710
of online nodejs projects there's

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,790
thousands and thousands and thousands

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,710
probably hundreds of thousands please

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,720
and we use these to automate our

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,330
front-end processes and they're

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,310
installed as part of node.js so we

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:21,830
install node.js so we can use node

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:25,100
package manager and run the node NPM

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:28,190
engulfed so we've installed nodejs we've

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,920
been start we we've said ok as far as

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,470
nodejs I now have no package manager and

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:37,370
now I'm going to use gulp which is the

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:39,410
actual task runner and it helps us

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,270
automate tasks like watching SAS which

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,420
we talked about before linting files

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,100
contaminating files and all those little

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,630
things that JavaScript to do hookers

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,550
like to do to make things really really

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,410
small smallness is that they

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,180
in JavaScript you know there's a whole

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,070
community of people that are like I

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,860
wrote an entire application and 15

00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:02,450
characters you know this is like we like

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:05,990
this we like change 19 so and we can add

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:09,920
to our gulp abilities by installing NPM

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,900
gulp Texas you can also use NPM as your

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,180
test runner and this is becoming more

00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,240
common I'm not going to talk about that

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,440
now because it's more common but it's

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,630
also a little bit more complicated

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,850
because the advantage of gulp is that

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,400
it's easy to read but a developer can do

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,280
it really fast the NPM is a little bit

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,890
more installed so to install gulp here

00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,900
we just put this up here because you see

00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,180
now I've installed node now all I have

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,700
to type is NPM install - test they dead

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,440
gulp and then run into your install and

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,190
I'll have soap on my machine and it's

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,350
ready to go

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:46,430
and I can start using all these fancy

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:49,220
little tools and all of them are the

00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:53,330
same way right install gulp SAS and cops

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,680
all catkin cat and Lynn uglify all these

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,780
things all those things I said before

00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,950
there's all these little NPM packages

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:03,320
that we install because we're installing

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,450
these little applications from somewhere

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,940
else it's important that we have version

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,040
controlling because when you're working

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,110
on a great big team one person might

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,150
have one version of nodejs another has

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,210
another version of nodejs another has a

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:18,500
version of SAS or theirs and the outcome

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,810
of your compiling is going to be

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,020
different okay so we need version

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:26,210
control for which application we're

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,760
using of all these millions and

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,410
thousands of NPM applications because

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,830
the guys who are working on them and the

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,000
women are updating it all the time so

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,250
you need this so that different

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,280
developers are using the same versions

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:43,010
of NPM and go test her project ok so on

00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,250
my machine I might be using SAS 3.0 over

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:48,530
here and SAS 2.0 or over here and and

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,450
you know node this over here and then

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,130
beyond that over there so you need to

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,710
have some version control so that when

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,100
you go into the project you're using the

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,260
right version of all these little things

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,360
and so the same machine might have two

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,580
versions of nodejs or plugins and

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,020
uses the right one at the right time and

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,150
some types of version control or

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,000
shrink-wrap power at the end of this

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:15,140
presentation I have a link to a great

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,170
article again I Jeff at a hook 42 wrote

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,310
that goes into how to really do this

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,560
right but it

00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,120
I could give a 15-minute talk on this so

00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,710
but just know that you need to do this

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,480
if you're working on a large team you

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,980
need to have version control if it's

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,010
just you you can have your own Taft

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,660
Runner yell cowboy and I'm fine but if

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,000
you're on a large team which most of us

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,560
are these days you need that so what can

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,490
Gospels do we've talked a little bit

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:43,340
about this but sass Lynch Jas yes lint

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,740
em which cleans up your code for you can

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,600
cat uglify which makes it really really

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,450
slow with JavaScript releases like

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,040
really really small and live reload

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,030
which is going to reload our browser so

00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,730
that we're not oh I changed read reload

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,530
I changed the pad really well now it's

00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,210
just you change the padding and it it's

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,800
going to work over here and just reload

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,520
it for you that's that's such a

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,930
time-saver and it can run rushed if it

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,890
can clear the cache for you this is like

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:18,170
wow Drupal and coal while we're together

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,690
and it does any repetitive tasks browser

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,610
sync libraries it can load libraries

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,430
like you don't want to load the library

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,900
through the Drupal 8 for some reason you

00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,170
can load vibrates and cope does all

00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,650
kinds of things so here's an example of

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,270
a gulp file at the top we just require

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:44,330
the the little gulp task that we want

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:47,420
and then we give it some different and

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:50,480
I'm sexist ok everybody what do we give

00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:55,040
it we give it not variables and this

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,680
crackers thank you and then we're going

00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,900
to make a little function that that when

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,940
we type gulp watch in this case the

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,430
first word is the function we're going

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,690
to say it's going to run those things

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:10,490
for us grunt so I mentioned Brent Brent

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,260
is over like we're not doing friend

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,940
anymore that's over that's some three

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,609
years ago

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,249
but you might inherit a project that has

00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:19,599
rent on it and it's almost exactly the

00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:21,129
same thing you'll see that the syntax

00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,720
difference using a little bit of a

00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,489
different thing but it's doing the same

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,609
thing you're loading them and then

00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:29,229
you're watching and anybody's a

00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:32,470
programmer to read these pretty easily

00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:35,799
and and follow along Ruby in fact is

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:38,619
another way so compass Ruby was another

00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,169
way you might inherited a project that

00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,999
has that and and so you'll have to

00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,279
install Ruby in order to use their sass

00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,960
and then there's a thing for that for

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,389
version managing again called Ruby

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,830
version manager I mention it just

00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:52,479
because you might run into these things

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,909
okay these are all the different ways

00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:57,129
that we've done it over the last few

00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:59,249
years go pretty much as one now so if

00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:02,470
you're starting from scratch use gulp

00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:11,289
but there you might run into these other

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:14,829
things the sass versus less sass unless

00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,869
so who here has done a less project it

00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,789
means you've done a less project who's

00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:20,099
done a less project in the last six

00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:23,440
months

00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:26,889
yeah so it's fewer okay so less again

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,569
less has its place but they're both CSS

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,789
preprocessors I've talked a lot about

00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:33,849
fast because sass really is the

00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:37,210
direction that we're going and why don't

00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:39,579
you even use these and I'm again this

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,260
part is for you back-end developers like

00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:44,250
who are like what is this and why

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,929
front-end developers five minutes here

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,669
we have cleaner clothes code with

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,909
reusable pieces and variables which we

00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:56,319
just didn't have before it saves us time

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:58,059
it's easier to maintain later on it's

00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:59,740
often very annoying for back-end

00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:01,809
developers because they have to also

00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,730
learn how to use all these tasks runners

00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:06,160
and compile things the way that we are

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,049
doing okay so friend and developers have

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,700
some some mercy on your back-end

00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:11,880
developers because they don't

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,160
necessarily see this list the way we do

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,599
but suddenly wow we can have calculation

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:22,660
from logic and we're more organized and

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:27,700
easier to set up so SAS SAS or less who

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:32,680
who prefers SAS who prefers less okay

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:35,500
you're wrong unless what you think I

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,569
seriously like I'm totally gonna but but

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,279
if you're starting a new project now it

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:43,569
says okay please use that okay

00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:45,460
unless less is your thing and as

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:47,890
seriously if it's you're saying it's

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:52,150
your thing and I'm not going to I'm not

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:54,460
going to come check your code and so now

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:58,059
we talked about just task runners we've

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,710
just talked about nodejs and NPM and all

00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:02,829
these little gulp tasks that we can do

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,660
but there's also tools just for stress

00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:06,819
right like you don't necessarily have to

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,880
use gulp to use these tools although I

00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:13,869
suggest that you do and and so we have

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:20,020
things like compass which sort of lets

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:24,450
you have more robust CSS bourbon Lucy is

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:27,190
a bourbon and CCR grid break point which

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,680
again works with your sass tools to give

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:34,839
you a reusable break points modular

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,329
scale is a typography thing and tippy is

00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:40,059
a typography thing but these are all the

00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:41,799
things that front-end people and we're

00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:44,200
starting to use more and more and this

00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,720
list is going to be like the grunt ok

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,569
this list changes I didn't even bother

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,220
to go through all of this too much take

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:52,990
a picture use these right now they're

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,329
going to change in three months what

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,130
everybody's using because we're going

00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:59,099
fast on the front end and we're changing

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,809
things up and the way things get used

00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,940
changes like I prefer Susi right now but

00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:08,020
you know three months from now it might

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:11,140
be something else so that was the end of

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:14,740
the the third part which is kind of your

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:19,180
your staff your NPM your nodejs that

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,579
sort of set of the world but now we're

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,730
those of us who are working on very very

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:29,039
large projects and are starting to talk

00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:32,099
about how about how we organize our CSS

00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,049
our staff because this is becoming more

00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:38,939
and more important how do I find things

00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:42,209
how do I change things and so this this

00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:45,390
is actually where I spend a lot of my

00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:48,419
time thinking and working right now and

00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,339
the checklist for this section is how

00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:50,849
are my twig file setup where my twig

00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,369
files

00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:54,269
what's my component file structure what

00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:56,640
are some sass

00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,439
what's a structure am I going to use or

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,109
am I going to combine them or am I going

00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:03,239
to use a different one are we going to

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:06,089
use pattern lab and atomic design that's

00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,489
another one so are we going to do

00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:11,729
JavaScript and decouple Drupal where's

00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:14,549
my REST API okay so this is an this is

00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:17,489
the kind of a new thing that we're all

00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:20,640
talking about and I know you from Enders

00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:22,079
are just sitting there going I have my

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,959
way that I like to do it and I want to

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,459
talk about it because this is where the

00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:29,880
real interesting stuff going on right

00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:33,239
now so twig file structure in Drupal 8

00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,539
ok classy is set up and nicely organized

00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,339
so thank you Martin for that yay and so

00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,229
when you go into core and you see classy

00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,150
this is your theme structure but as

00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:45,150
you'll notice this this same structure

00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,009
is really varied ruefully okay it's a

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,569
very Drupal theme structure so if you

00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:51,359
have to go and find your twig templates

00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:54,269
it's really Drupal II right field data

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,999
set form layout and this is this very

00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:59,669
Drupal centric but where we're going on

00:38:56,999 --> 00:39:02,219
the front end is more of a component

00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:04,079
file structure ok and we're going to

00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:07,619
talk about pattern lab and atomic design

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,869
in just a second but sometimes Quigs

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,789
files are in component so we're going to

00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:15,659
look at Zen for d8 this is where things

00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:17,880
are going because instead of organizing

00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:20,999
them by file type like we had before

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,579
with the classy right where we have all

00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:25,409
the content Len and fields align the

00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,809
views and one that's very Drupal e right

00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:30,809
that's not a component based structure

00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:34,049
we want to have components so what's a

00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,729
component for example in Zen the footer

00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:37,949
is a component and you see this is a

00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:41,000
very different file structure in the

00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:44,220
footer we have the JSON

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,740
the SAS and the twig all together in one

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,390
folder before we used to have all the

00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,950
SAS and one folder all the twig in one

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,350
folder all the JavaScript in one folder

00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:54,810
they were kind of away from each other

00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:56,730
but now we're starting to group things

00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,550
together based on their functionality

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,740
and their component why do this because

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,080
if you need to change something in the

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,810
footer you're probably going to need to

00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,560
change the JavaScript and the toy file

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:13,170
and the cess it's revolutionary we can

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,090
find them all into place we don't have

00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:17,330
to go around and find the three things

00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:20,640
and their name something different and

00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:23,400
because naming gets naming hard okay so

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,950
this is where things are going and thank

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,670
you for to Tom who's working on the Zen

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:32,100
theme for showing us the way so within

00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:34,260
this ok so now we know we want things

00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,920
kind of componentized right ok so that's

00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,530
one idea but we also just have all these

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,570
selectors and they're all over the place

00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,730
and sass is getting bigger and bigger so

00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,310
we're trying to get organized so we have

00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,690
three main types of sass structures that

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,480
are predominant today there are other

00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,040
ones and we're going to I would love to

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,940
hear if you have a new way of doing it

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,520
this one time other stuff so so we have

00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,740
snacks which organizes folders and

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,040
directors generally we're going to look

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:08,010
at what's Max's BEM block element

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,650
modifier which is generally how you name

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,660
your classes I say generally because I

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,930
already showed you a file structure and

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,880
these have different folder structures

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,560
so you're he's might be taking and

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,960
borrowing from all of these different

00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,940
things and not some people are like all

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,200
smacks max my sister facts some people

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,410
use max in them

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,590
some people use Max and benefit oriented

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:34,020
CSS so there's there's a there's these

00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:38,250
are three main ways of thinking about it

00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:42,660
but you don't have to use just one so a

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:46,640
smacks example is this and smacks as you

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:50,900
see it it it's

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,060
define things as like layout and then

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:57,920
colors and classes and it has a very

00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:00,230
specific naming structure and block

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,750
element modifier a lot of people like

00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,360
this because it's a little bit easier to

00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:08,119
remember the block is the nav the

00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,430
element is the list or the link and the

00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,220
modifier is active or not active right

00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,410
so it's it's a pretty much it's a much

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,820
more human readable kind of way to do

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,850
things

00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:22,910
object-oriented CSS as you see here is

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:25,880
the idea that we are separating layout

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,850
and so the first three like button box

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,090
and widgets I'll have layouts with types

00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:34,910
and then skin defines the look in the

00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:38,480
feel of something so in object oriented

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:41,240
CSS we get many many classes that all

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,610
that you add many different classes to

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:48,920
one one element in the Dom to do that so

00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,360
these are the three big and I really

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,990
encourage you to go out and look at all

00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:55,220
of these have websites all of them have

00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,720
different ways of doing things and

00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,530
you're going to start seeing these more

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,130
and more in themes as you go on there's

00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:06,140
also a big push right now for pattern

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,440
lab and atomic design does anybody in

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,890
here done a pattern lab site yet okay we

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,920
have a couple yeah pattern lab is that

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:18,590
it it was worth mentioning on its own

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,900
because it's an application I call it

00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:23,720
application in quotes okay that creates

00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,060
a very nifty style guide and it's based

00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,190
on atomic design and this again like I

00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,740
was saying removing two component based

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,800
things here's where we get even more

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,990
component base so in atomic design you

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,960
start even smaller so you have things

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:41,150
over here like little buttons and then

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,540
which are atoms and then the buttons all

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:47,359
go together to make a bar which is a

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,609
molecule and then the bar goes together

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:52,040
to make a full thing which is an

00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,400
organism and then it makes kind of a

00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,250
template and then a page

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,710
so you're going from this really small

00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,810
thing to this big thing it's a it's

00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,690
again a shift in how we're organizing

00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,510
how we're thinking how we're developing

00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,790
and the front end is no longer your

00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,790
JavaScript's all here your CSS is all

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,410
here we're going more into each little

00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,020
component being something that we can

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,660
modify on its own

00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,880
also pattern lab gives you this style

00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,820
guide which is pretty awesome if you

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,520
worked with it you can set your Styles

00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,470
in here and it should all show you the

00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,200
HTML on the twig in order to have the

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,150
style and everything is clicky clicky

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,460
and easy for your client and your client

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,740
goes blue and you didn't do anything

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,330
right so well you had to get pattern

00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,450
loud to work with Drupal which is some

00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,980
fee but but this is a wow factor and

00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,630
this is something I think we're going to

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,520
see coming up more in the front end

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:51,930
we're less on the like theme based and

00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,670
more on the we're going to start

00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:57,270
plugging in our own little applications

00:44:53,670 --> 00:45:01,110
that help us organize and modify where

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:04,080
we're going so JavaScript can be coupled

00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,850
duple and these live outside of your

00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,100
scene ok if you've ever worked with

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,080
decoupled rupal it's important to note

00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,790
this is nowhere in your feet these are

00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,460
their own things they have their own

00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:17,190
file structures if you're using react

00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:22,500
angular ember does we may see a pattern

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:24,540
here remember do ya these again I don't

00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,450
go over any one of these reactants see

00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,400
winner right now I can guarantee you

00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,180
three months from now there is going to

00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,710
be a completely new do couple friend in

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,220
awesomeness that were we haven't even

00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,720
heard of yet right JavaScript developers

00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,510
just going crazy with this right now

00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,790
so and but if you are doing a decoupled

00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,320
theme these are going to live outside of

00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,670
your seems like you might put it in the

00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,220
theme folder but it you have its own

00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,810
structure and this really isn't part of

00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,060
your season if you run into a site where

00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,950
you inherit one of these it's not your

00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:00,630
theme it's its own thing

00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:04,740
ok so this is where I quote myself which

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,030
is controversial but this is where I

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,250
you know we're talking about these

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,869
things and I get in arguments with other

00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,960
front-end developers all the time about

00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:15,750
been more smacks or powder laughs I did

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,570
it but more important than all of that

00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:21,330
okay more important which one you choose

00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:24,869
is that you tell me which one you chose

00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:27,900
in the readme file okay you may not own

00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:29,580
this theme forever you may not own this

00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,220
triple site forever if you could just

00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,560
please put in a remote readme that says

00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,410
you know I kind of used them but

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,109
seriously I kind of use snacks and then

00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,380
the client really wanted me to use fruit

00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:46,020
terms so everything's rutabaga and

00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,380
orange and you know and but gives your

00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,570
your next above or some help okay think

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,099
about who and who else is going to

00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:56,280
inherit this because I've been heritage

00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:57,990
a lot of crazy things other things that

00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,190
you want in your dev environment if

00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,500
you're going to take a picture of one

00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,210
take a picture this one black there's a

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,550
Drupal twig where you can go and talk to

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:09,030
people like me and say why the heck is

00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:11,550
in my twig working it's a slack channel

00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:14,400
that anybody can join in okay come hang

00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:17,040
out with us on slack alright I also use

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,290
Xcode for an iPhone simulator I cannot

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,359
tell you how awesome it is yes it's

00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,640
worth downloading Xcode for an iPhone

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,400
simulator you can run all the sauce labs

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,490
and whatever you want but and being able

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,670
to go in and poke at it right there

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:35,310
while you're developing is is great

00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:37,140
browser plugins like live reload yes

00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,740
you still need Photoshop an illustrator

00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,480
yeah those of you who use open source

00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,680
they're nice too but if you can get your

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,410
boss to pay for Photoshop and

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,270
illustrator and ticketing systems like

00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,710
JIRA and Soho yes as a friend and

00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:52,560
developer you are going to need to learn

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,900
to use those and then bookmarks okay

00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,980
again my aliases on my bookmarks are

00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,339
always the things that people are like

00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:02,040
you're so fast I'm you know so so cool

00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:04,830
so that's it for setting up a front-end

00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,410
DevOps please join us for contribution

00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,839
sprints even if you haven't before it's

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:13,290
really easy to get involved with Drupal

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,470
and if you would like to comment on this

00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:18,860
at all this is these are the surveys

00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,280
and so I think all the fish you guys

00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:25,670
[Applause]

00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,670
[Music]

00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:42,690
there's a microphone if you want to ask

00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:44,460
question hi hi I just want to commend

00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,850
you that was actually a really great

00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,100
overview getting in depth of all the

00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:53,790
different components that kind of laid

00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,440
out a Drupal 8 theme and I also want to

00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,120
invite anybody that wanted to take it

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,920
maybe a little bit deeper we're having a

00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,830
bob tomorrow at one o'clock it's called

00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,080
Drupal theming patterns okay so please

00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:07,880
join us just to discuss this kind of

00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,880
topic it's great thank you

00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,330
hello hi I'm a back-end developer

00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,650
longtime back-end developer I have some

00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,540
experience with Fred and with that some

00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:20,010
day I was focused on cross browser

00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,330
design and all that stuff so I

00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,130
understand a lot about we talk about

00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:26,430
great talk by the way my question is

00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,440
what is your preference for the out of

00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,150
the different CSS structures what is

00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,160
your preference right now oh I'm

00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:35,460
definitely at like if you're going to do

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,250
one thing do components start syncing

00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,440
component structures and and pattern lab

00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,540
and atomic design not necessarily using

00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:48,360
pattern lab and atomic design but start

00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:51,180
thinking in that way yeah what is your

00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,220
opinion on using the Xcode simulator for

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,670
the iPhone versus using the Safari

00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,560
plugin that allows you to debug directly

00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,980
in the iPhone that that's a great

00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,740
question and the Xcode simulator it

00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:07,650
simulates a little bit better touch and

00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,770
your touch your swipes and things like

00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:13,200
that and the Safari one does a great job

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,750
for like a first pass but I have a

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,560
client who is very very specific about

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:21,750
iPhone products in general and the the

00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,510
iPhone simulator is like having an

00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:27,150
iPhone and mocha and the worst of the

00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:29,670
Firefox one is pretty darn close but

00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,590
there's a difference well no I in Safari

00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,740
you can plug your iPhone into your

00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:36,130
computer oh oh yeah go ahead and do that

00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,880
if you

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:44,390
yes yes if it's the idea for me I just I

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,220
can't be bothered so the Xcode is right

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:51,940
on mine yeah ice cream

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:54,770
thank you I also don't have an iPhone hi

00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:58,280
great presentation thank you very much

00:50:54,770 --> 00:51:04,099
so I hope you didn't think you would get

00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:07,340
away with it right less versus NASA so I

00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:10,430
am one of those less guys that yeah and

00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:14,950
I would like you to convince me to go to

00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:19,430
SAS which I do but less than less so

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:22,880
could you give me two pros for SAS and

00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:25,790
two cons for less yeah they're kind of

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,190
the same thing though but the SAS

00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:30,950
community is bigger and people are

00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:35,300
developing tools for it is that it's the

00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:37,820
number one reason to go SAS less I think

00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:41,300
less is is equitable discuss in a lot of

00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,950
ways but fact has more tools and more

00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:47,180
plugins because there are more people

00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:50,210
using it so I don't for a smaller site

00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:52,430
less is fantastic I actually really

00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:55,089
enjoy less I think it's a good thing but

00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:58,670
it's going to continue to fall behind

00:51:55,089 --> 00:52:03,170
because there aren't the same number of

00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:07,339
developers making tools for it so it's

00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:11,150
not it's not that I think and SAS forces

00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:12,880
less is inherently better it's just that

00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:17,660
that's what the community has decided

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:20,330
yeah I saw that bootstrap for is now

00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:23,869
moving to SAS yeah they still provide

00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:26,210
less but now it's written SAS so yeah

00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:28,220
and they kind of come to the same the

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:31,820
same conclusion that they can get more

00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:34,700
developers to help them you know crazy

00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,920
things like and and breakpoints

00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:41,260
and and the other things that we want to

00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,849
plug into these into SAS or into our

00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,330
preprocessor we don't want to fall

00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:47,280
behind

00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:50,310
in the tools that we're developing and

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,850
and less you know they're just it's kind

00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:56,760
of like drug they were the same but now

00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:59,960
people just have chosen SAS so yeah

00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,960
thank you yeah thank you

00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,090
hi hello my question is basically just

00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,770
about them when you organize in your SAS

00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,180
files and you say you're using something

00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,890
like bourbon

00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,470
some of the companies I've worked with

00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,850
they would they have their SAS files

00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,950
what they'll do is they'll set up their

00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,760
breakpoints in one file send their

00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:22,500
desktop files in one file can you talk

00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,290
about what's kind of what's the better

00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,910
format would to organize your breakpoint

00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,510
to organize your files out in different

00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,910
types or have it like one big file that

00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,380
you would use for all your breakpoints

00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:38,010
and everything else in it does that make

00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,680
sense yeah so um when I develop and and

00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,590
this is pretty common now you put the

00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,840
breakpoints / selector so you don't put

00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:50,960
all of your you don't put all of your

00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,640
let's say your large or your desktop a

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,110
CSS together because when we're

00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,170
developing again we're going more

00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,490
towards components right so if you think

00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,040
about what you're doing like let's say

00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:05,670
we want to modify a button right we want

00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,500
to know what that button looks like at

00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,240
every stage we don't necessarily want to

00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,820
know what the whole thing looks like at

00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,640
this stage or that stage where as

00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:17,190
developers we really are looking at 90%

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,200
of time at a button okay so that's why

00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,150
you put your brick you put your you make

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,480
a global breakpoints you reference those

00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:29,010
break points per selector and that it

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,500
does add a little bit more um CSS yeah

00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:32,850
night and that was the cause that's the

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,980
thing I was having with my team I was

00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,840
telling them the I'm kind of new to the

00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,820
team and they're used to doing it a

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,860
certain way and explain to them just

00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,990
saying well look if you're looking at a

00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,060
button you have just different buttons

00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,950
than maybe mobile style or maybe in a

00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,270
desktop and format so if you use

00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,070
something like bourbon where you can

00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:52,530
just bring in your mobile breakpoints

00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,660
and do it all one there that file size

00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,640
will be bigger but even though the file

00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,359
size is bigger it makes it easier to

00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,700
maintain the

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,109
overall because now you're developers

00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,789
don't have to go back in three four

00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:04,109
different files and look for those all

00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:06,420
they have to do is look at that one

00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:09,059
button and it's there for so I just want

00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,160
to talk about and that's that's a design

00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:12,690
pattern that's again probably like you

00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,289
said they're used to doing it that way

00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:18,450
because again three years ago we didn't

00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:20,369
know which way was the best way right so

00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:22,499
they chose one and I actually have a

00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:24,509
site that I had to I had to yeah and

00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:27,660
I've done that back weekend and that's a

00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:31,259
pain so I'm super sorry but yes it is

00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,150
yeah but but yeah that's that you're

00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:35,219
absolutely right it's the direction that

00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:38,029
we're going now is component based and

00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,589
and show on pattern lab anatomic design

00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:46,410
because that that's where the community

00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:49,200
is going okay thank you yeah that's

00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:52,140
actually that's a good segue into my

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,799
questions so how are you hooking a

00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:57,599
pattern lab with Drupal oh yeah it's

00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,640
there's some work that goes into it I

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,349
personally am NOT working on this at my

00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,829
company right now but we are

00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:06,299
implementing it for a UCSF it should

00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:08,099
come out in a couple of months and you

00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:09,449
can go into that that will be open

00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:11,549
source you can go in and see how they

00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,650
did it okay thank you yeah you're

00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:16,019
welcome

00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:18,869
um so I'm wondering you talked a lot

00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:21,029
about how fast this is moving I mean

00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:23,160
just the trends and everything how do

00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:26,519
you keep track of it like how I'm like

00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,979
I'm a director I'm not around over I

00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,930
need to know whether my team is going in

00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:33,269
the right direction or just I want to

00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,979
keep it in touch with the trends how can

00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:37,349
I do that what's what's the best sources

00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:39,299
out there well this is again not popular

00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:42,269
amongst front-end people but I'm going

00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:44,130
to say it's just a theme so whatever

00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:47,459
they are comfortable in and whatever

00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:50,279
your team has ability in is what you

00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:52,709
should choose so I would question them

00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:54,930
like is that the best thing really but

00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,609
but ultimately they're going to decide

00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,349
what they feel comfortable with you're

00:56:56,609 --> 00:57:00,390
going to be faster and more organized

00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:04,499
because of it if you start pushing them

00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:06,299
into adopting something that here's what

00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:07,979
here's the nice light if you push them

00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:09,420
into adopting something that something's

00:57:07,979 --> 00:57:11,440
going to be gone in three months - right

00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,559
so whatever their comfort

00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,839
with you know and then when you go to re

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,280
redo your sites two or three years later

00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:21,420
you're going to start over from scratch

00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:24,160
me coming anyway okay it's got it

00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,230
hi there this actually piggybacks off of

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,819
that question but an informal poll to

00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,369
the room if you guys are using a grid

00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:32,319
system is it singularity is it Susie

00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,770

00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:38,619

00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:41,200
Susie is definitely taking the lead okay

00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:43,270
um but singularity is very popular I

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,910
