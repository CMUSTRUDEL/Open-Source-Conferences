Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: This Time, It’s Personalized: Preparing your site
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Many sites are focused on two key goals: improved conversion and improved user experience. Web personalization has the potential to significantly increase performance on both.

With personalization, we can show a message in Mandarin to a visitor from China, for example, or remember a user’s previous visit and display an upcoming program more likely to be relevant to them. Evidence shows that this kind of personalization works -- some studies indicate average conversion increases of as much as 30%.

Yet despite a driving need for organizations to improve both conversion and usability, many groups are stuck, not knowing where to start, what processes need to be put into place, and what they need to prepare beforehand.

In this talk, we will discuss how to get started with personalization, including suggestions on incremental steps you can take to make web personalization a sustainable part of your team’s daily activity.

We will also discuss how personalization can be accomplished in Drupal. Finally, we’ll talk about the preparation you can do to ensure your personalization initiative will be successful, and how to get buy-in from internal stakeholders.

Note: Some familarity with the concepts of personalization are useful, but no prior knowledge of the subject is assumed. We'll explain in plain language what personalization is and how it can be used.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,389
so this talk is called this times

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,830
personalized preparing your site for

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,440
effective personalization I'm going to

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,280
try to talk fast and sorry about that

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,330
but we have a lot of information to get

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,490
through so the agenda today is what is

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,199
personalization watch that care planning

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,910
for it sustain your strategies

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,189
implementation options in conclusion and

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,010
just really particularly populated with

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:31,470
your topic or image entity Thank You

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:34,160
Canada yeah okay I'm a walker so it's

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,610
hard for me to maybe grab oh yeah um

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,480
maybe later

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,460
perfect so first step is why

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,730
personalization probably not a brand new

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,010
topic everybody but it's important to

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,840
know so how do engage users with

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,760
divergent needs within a single site a

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,350
big challenge for any kind of site but

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,070
especially sites like higher education

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,649
sites public sector sites any anyone who

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,030
have lots of different active users how

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,170
to improve content discoverability in

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,969
sites with hundreds of thousands of

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,519
pages so how can we push the key content

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,990
up to users and make them feel like the

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,360
site is more for them that's tailored to

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,650
their needs and also how to accommodate

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,150
users who may have longer decision

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,189
cycles so if someone's coming back six

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,659
months from now or if somebody's coming

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,740
back three months for now after they

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,570
need more time to think through a

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,900
decision how do we kind of hit them at

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,110
the right moment so that's where

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,259
personalization hopefully comes in so

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,150
this is a maybe a little bit of an older

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,530
older school example but there's a

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,180
standard page right here just to give

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,439
you an example of what personalization

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,759
looks like just in case you want a

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:42,740
mental picture so on a standard page we

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,740
can magically provides in as if they

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,610
international students well that's

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,610
brazen version as we could say Hey

00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:03,050
and then potentially TMI the start

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,130
getting to the uncanny valley of

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,509
creepiness when we're talking to

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,209
starting to talk to people as if they've

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,830
broken the fourth wall but that gives

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,180
you an idea of some of the things we can

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,720
do with personalization many many things

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,580
you could do but the idea is to get more

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,690
and more engagement so the potential

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,430
outcomes are to give your users what

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,890
they're looking for at the right time in

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,030
the desired format improve retention and

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,310
conversion and increase user

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:36,920
satisfaction so the research on this is

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:43,190
really saying that fertilization people

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:46,630
commit fertilization do it well cases we

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,700
consultancy certainly on that HubSpot

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:52,489
looked at 30,000 if they're fair users

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,590
they're very broad survey they found 42

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,510
percent of people who personalize call

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,860
to action or sorry please for the 42

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,260
percent higher conversion rate after

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,280
people who personalize calls to action

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,829
so amazing stuff so why doesn't anyone

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,200
doing it how many people are doing it by

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:13,220
the way ok a few people 3/4 it's great

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,180
limited time and budget continued

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,450
priorities technology barriers what

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,100
property

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,290
I'm not going to we're start Auto

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,329
implement what the last man I don't

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,799
measure success and how do I tell it to

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:29,420
my team and make them feel like spending

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,940
money is worth more time so what I'd

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,650
like to talk about is not necessarily

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,640
how did you personalization is

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,470
definitely Drupal what talk about how

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,870
you get moving

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,700
your organization how can you plan for

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,900
it and effectively get started on that

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,310
initiative so effective personalization

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,380
like anything worth doing requires

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,150
planning there are incremental steps we

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:59,170
be paid first the strategy and second to

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,350
be right there we could layer in develop

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:05,240
there's a great article in here this is

00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:10,600
linked to pond bottom that I can share

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,600
the slide deck where even you talk about

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,900
the little vagueness of personalization

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,200
so the key cornerstones our technology

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,450
content data but if you start with the

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,790
technology without the content analytics

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,020
data you'll a lot of times end up

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:36,650
spinning your wheels and not making the

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:39,200
best use of the technology so I'm

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,600
talking too fast I'm losing my moisture

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,610
quickly as well so before beginning with

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,370
the technology we have to step back into

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,140
RPG though what is the way to get our

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,830
users to engage the site how can we

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:56,419
understand with users and make sure you

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,860
have to read content so we need to

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,740
understand audience the content and the

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,750
context what are the businesses who are

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,430
users what we want what key content will

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,060
help you achieve the goals and what

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,530
friction what sort of anxieties or pain

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,500
points are holding the back from from

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:17,150
achieving those goals so some great

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,210
activities to help you prepare for

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,410
personalization are kind of the

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,080
traditional activities associated

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,140
account recovery project or that user

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,300
user kind of gauge your project so

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,300
identify for causational user goal and

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,950
not just talking about both we monitor

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,440
classic site is a little bit deeper

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,120
what are some our key segments maybe

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,280
have five key segments give you a twenty

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,830
key segments where the value proposition

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,000
is drive your users and they can feel

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,650
motivation attachment to you to your

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,520
content developing personas so a lot of

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,150
the photos

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,930
so personify your users helping to

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:04,839
ensure that the site is matching

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:07,210
returning users matching mapping user

00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:19,479
journeys and also gathering user user

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:21,819
feedback so personalization to use and

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,259
it can actually make use of that to

00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,150
build up much more sophisticated data

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,099
models and gauge our users much more

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,229
effectively so you're not doing anything

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,180
this is what you should be doing when

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,490
you're getting ready for a personal

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,719
dictionary so the first step is

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,719
identifying business and user goal

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:43,210
identify the overlap between

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,339
institutional needs and what the users

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,889
need identifying the gap the gap there

00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,279
so who are users what benefits can be up

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,599
to them

00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,029
and I'm probably not being picked up

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:56,529
very well by the mic hello there and how

00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:59,409
can we reach them so in order to get

00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,569
that data moving within the organization

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,339
a key activity that we do a lot of

00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,310
people do sort on sites they do a lot of

00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,629
them because of stakeholder engagement

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,129
activities we'd like to get the actual

00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,849
users in the room together so this is an

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:16,240
example of actual users of an actual

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:18,819
product thing in a room together talking

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,129
about what are the sort of key things

00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,229
they need they need from the product and

00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,339
you know how do they use it what's the

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,949
context of the use all that kind of

00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,659
stuff super amazing great data everybody

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,899
gets excited tons of opportunities for

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:33,249
buy-in and enlightenment enlightenment

00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,149
always ensues which is always great when

00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:37,959
you can guarantee

00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:39,839
epiphany an activity so these are some

00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,430
of the outcomes from activity like this

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,370
all the personas that are sort of the

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,399
key personas for the for the product

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:52,120
website the priority which ones are most

00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,490
important and then value propositions

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,719
what users actually respond to what

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,579
messages makes them feel like they want

00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,949
to move forward what messages leave them

00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:02,099
cold what do you power pretty powerful

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,099
stuff

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,760
the second part is identifying and

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,330
developing user personas so how many

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,100
people here have personas on your site

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:17,350
okay both third okay so let's forget so

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,480
the important part of developing these

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,950
episode is it just is basing them in

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,930
some sort of research to data not just

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,090
coming up with them from your head which

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,710
could be a great starting point but

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,290
establishing who are the key audience

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,880
types that want to connect with the site

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,090
you want what are their goals and

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,350
motivation and what do what makes them

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,060
sort of stay up at night what are they

00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,050
anxious about this is the price of your

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,550
product is it the difficulty of choosing

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,400
among many different options all those

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,770
different things so this is another

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,470
example of an on-site we've done with

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:53,370
these are all real users not actors to

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,870
play users on within a workshop

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,400
developing sort user journeys and

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,600
personas together collaboratively super

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:07,240
super amazing activity I noted that we

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:11,830
get things like this so we get these

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,290
great personas I'm going to try I'm

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,270
gonna try we get these great personas

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,310
that are actually based on some sort of

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,330
actual analysis data talking to users we

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,650
know we have a little more confidence

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,190
that these are the actual the right

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,080
information which then we can sort of

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,050
have our personalization engine consume

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,360
this this really sort of great

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,390
segmentation data the third part is

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,120
mapping user journeys so for each

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,370
individual persona whether prospective

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,950
student or a new customer whatever it

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,960
might be identifying pathways for

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,180
achieving their goals how will they get

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,590
there what's getting in the way what

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,130
content will they need needs to be

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:53,680
created in order to support this journey

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,720
so again this is this is something we

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,660
really like to do with users as well

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,890
well if you get them in a room together

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,270
whenever possible or if not possible you

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,680
get stakeholders together and look at

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,060
your analytics and all kinds of ways you

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,530
can do that mapping out the persona user

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,900
journeys how did it get to your site

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,900
what do they want to know let me go

00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:22,069
the actual path rotating but also with

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,959
the key content embassy get wet order

00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:27,499
we got journey and that really helps us

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,029
understand how to personalize a site so

00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:30,589
we identified that some magic is in blue

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,720
the blue area today of having the

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,100
opportunity what will get them to keep

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,049
going but we'll get them to keep moving

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,589
in the journey and finally gathering

00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,399
user feedback

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:45,079
sounds easy slip so hard validating hug

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,899
on sneeze we've generated identifying

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,119
issues with the current site but is

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:53,679
blocking users right now is our proposed

00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:53,679
direction correct this is the right

00:10:55,869 --> 00:11:40,429
slide I think so this is the item we try

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,079
to choose for different projects so that

00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:46,850
we can get a really complete package via

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,470
so this is just vital stuff there's all

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,230
kinds of different types of things you

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,899
can do within this picture but I

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,790
strongly encourage you to check this out

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,139
and think about what is the ways you can

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,579
combine these data sources not just

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,790
using Google Analytics but actually

00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:04,100
getting outside of that whether it's on

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,540
moderate testing or focus groups

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,419
whatever you want to do lots of

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,049
different possibilities and the link is

00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:14,239
in the bottom of the slide there so out

00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:17,529
of all of this effort makes sort of very

00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:19,309
contradiction elasaur UX activity

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,169
hopefully the outcomes are you

00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,720
understand what users value what they

00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,529
don't what does the sequence in priority

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,829
they want to receive

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,870
information and content in how do they

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,540
want to receive information video charts

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:37,009
testimonial so on and how do we get them

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,819
to how do we get our team to buy in our

00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:43,430
colleagues our bosses or sponsors

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:45,499
showing this this data showing this even

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,259
getting them into the workshop make a

00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:50,240
huge difference to getting them on board

00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:55,249
and excited we see that time and time

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,540
and time again right so you collect all

00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,309
this information you're preparing your

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,050
site you're gathering all this great

00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,970
data about your users thinking about how

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,480
you want to architect your content so

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,930
how do you actually implement

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,610
personalization well once you've thought

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,999
about the content the data and the

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,529
analytics those personas the sort of raw

00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,749
data that you've collected and the

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,730
content you developing the fourth part

00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:19,999
as well so you need something somebody

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,170
put it so in order to get ready for

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,519
automation you need the right platform

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,870
so with the frame framework of content

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,559
meaningful data analysis we can now

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,870
start layering in technology so a couple

00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,579
of you know use cases like for example a

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,389
user from China we might want to show

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,339
them an international program

00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,110
information but we were able to also

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,920
emphasize academic reputation because

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,389
that's very important

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,089
generally for students from Asia is

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,189
reputation is a key driver and a value

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,860
proposition we might also want to

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:49,910
emphasize safety a visitor to a nursing

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,649
program we might want to display

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,939
testimonials featuring a nursing student

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:57,529
on the about page rather than generic

00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:59,569
without page so there's lots of things

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,089
that can do that some of them very easy

00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:04,339
some of them are harder some of the

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,860
options that Drupal included up via lift

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,699
so that's available for Drupal 8 which

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,079
is very robust product

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,189
there's also contributed modules some of

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,120
the challenges some of the contribute

00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:22,000
modules in this email is a facilitation

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:26,140
seven only I believe so that might be

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,370
such an accreta libido and also custom

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,010
solutions which we've done a number of

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,540
times where we tie together geolocation

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,860
data taxonomy to kind of pull together

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,810
so itself helps help you their self

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,990
identify and drive them to the custom

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,730
pathways based on that video so those

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,839
are Drupal options they're also great

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,990
best-of-breed products like evergage

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,490
fantastic products out there so a lot of

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,279
times it could be the case is the best

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,570
option for you is a third party option

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,580
that does it does everything you need to

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,210
really really well so lifted lift is out

00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,850
there every gauge as well as a qubit

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,830
there's many others out there so check

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,260
them out custom some fantastic tools

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,600
were kind of taking all this research

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,370
and data you collected and actually

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,420
allow them to omni it in a sort of

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:21,370
powerful way so here's an example of a

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,440
qubit screen so new customers on viruses

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,150
this one your persona it suggested that

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,150
so that it's starting to

00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:39,279
finally start your persona activities

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,779
you're moving forward how do you keep it

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
going

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,110
resources resources are always limited

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,990
how do we include personalization into

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:54,880
our existing process to make it virtual

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:57,910
and supportive so the first step is

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,550
start small start with one thing

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,230
start with one change measure the

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,660
effectiveness of that make another

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,259
change report back on your findings to

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,240
your peers to your upward stakeholders

00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,480
and that really helps sort of get buy-in

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,209
motivation get those quick win and focus

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,800
on activities with the highest ROI be

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,600
careful over reliance on sort of just

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,130
looking at what behavior how to

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,690
understand why people are doing things

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,389
and how you can make changes to really

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,160
hit that hit mark with your users and

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:28,750
focusing effort on optimization of a

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,600
variety so not changing content all the

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:37,810
time freeze your homepage make your

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,860
homepage great and focus on that so lots

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,100
of things you can do to make your data

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,810
more actionable do customer research set

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,120
up a user customer advisory board or

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,670
focus group set up a booth and offer a

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,839
pastry who doesn't like patrons there

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:55,000
are some and focused as much as you can

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,610
on collecting qualitative data which is

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,100
often more actionable as it makes us

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,519
understand why people want what they

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,809
want not just not just what they want

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,569
once you have a personalization engine

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,230
in place all these things become

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,970
something things become a lot easier

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,860
they're up in survey tools built into

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,449
these products and lots of different

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:22,329
ways you can get I get you take a sort

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:25,539
of enrich your data alright so in

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,010
conclusion personalization over and over

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,569
again is shown to have it enormous

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,340
alrights what pies are alike to me as

00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:36,070
you can do so if you're wondering how

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,720
has a needle the outcomes are improved

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,049
big time by understanding the users and

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,480
motivations if you just install you know

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,980
lift and start using it you're not going

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,720
to probably get as much value as if you

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,549
sucked into research activities before

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,500
you get there talking to users not

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,929
looking at graphs of fun so having those

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,020
conversations understanding what users

00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,740
actually want is really critical and

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,440
then finally when you're beginning

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,480
personalization start small be sure to

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,909
measure the better test one or two

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,200
changes and then do that and it makes a

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:16,030
lot of changes and feel truck that's it

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,470
I think we have well good time look at

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,470
that seven minutes I talk too fast

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:28,799
yeah which pulse was that

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:37,350
was it what was it the aux guys one yeah

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,759
yeah absolutely

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,489
was it this one oh yeah that was great

00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:45,190
that's cool

00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:46,419
hey I'm Frank Carrie I'm curious what

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,090
your feedback it sounds like you may

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,440
have worked on a few of these projects

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,869
we've mostly done the custom we haven't

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,639
yet done one personalization engine I'm

00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:57,399
wondering if if you found certain

00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:59,169
platforms certain site types are easier

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,989
or harder versus others say like news

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:04,570
versus fashion or something right um

00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:06,279
well I'll enter the best of my ability

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:20,769
and then let me know what your question

00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:23,710
I think we can plan it for a because

00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:27,549
that site is asking users are you would

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:29,409
like um Tito or are you implemented so

00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,720
that kind of B is naturally the

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:33,820
equipment set all the time so that was a

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,659
great sort of progression at fit super

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,759
well with the way that they were

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,320
thinking about the site already I can

00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,929
also be a higher education site we do

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,879
with your how your head of what okay a

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,220
lot how your sites are great for that a

00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:47,739
lot of damping such a persona menu we

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,210
have different sort of waves of harmony

00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:52,149
to users they're collecting that data

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,809
all time so that can be another sizes of

00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,919
natural next step

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,739
does that answer your question okay

00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,909
great so I had a question on the

00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:05,830
different options custom third-party or

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,869
aqua a lift I know the live pricing and

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,519
right so what does that look him up

00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,379
it's uh you know for those of you who

00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,049
don't know it's five figures I think

00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:15,580
exactly the census so that might rule

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:17,159
out four different groups that you're

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,210
working with but then so what is the

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,669
benchmark for the free options that

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,889
engage or you know if you've worked on

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:25,899
custom solutions about how much time and

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,769
money was that you sure that yeah I can

00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,809
definitely that so that's a great

00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,859
question we thought about that a lot

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,239
because we didn't want to implement

00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,619
something because there's also the

00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,999
recurring cost because once you have it

00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,509
you know you need to continue with paper

00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:39,700
license we chose the Oh custom because

00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,769
of that very reason we felt that we were

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,450
able to deliver something within sort of

00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,769
twenty thirty hours worth of effort

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,610
there was actually valuable and worth

00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,830
doing

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,250
so in that case it was it paid off it

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,360
was the right sort of investment and we

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,679
only need to really set up a few of

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,019
those things once we didn't feel we need

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,149
to spend another five thousand or ten

00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,690
thousand in the next year so that's why

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,690
we would custom

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,600
so I believe lift was previously in

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,879
triple7 based on the personalized module

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,710
but since then it's detached from that

00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:26,179
because that module is not reported

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,100
would you believe so right now this is

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,629
where I don't know I tried to look

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,710
around they tried to poke around and try

00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,629
to find some triple-eight office I

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,360
couldn't find any that were in any kind

00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:38,110
of shape lift is really the only thing I

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,190
could find that was triple-eight ready

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,499
but so I'll see a lot of third-party

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,409
options have incredible capabilities

00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:48,440
again if the budget is not ready for

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:51,220
that kind of option then Drupal 8 may

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,220
not be quite there yet

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,070
yeah definitely I wonder what it could

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,890
do

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:10,580
I wonder is when this talk to end I can

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,670
put my slides up and I'll add them to

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,210
the like webpage of this talk and then

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,350
then you can see that yeah because it is

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,660
hard to read somebody's at the bottom

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,660
but anyway I'll tell you what we do

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:35,120
Google and Google even you he's the Guru

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:37,280
guy deep in you why you and he has about

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,480
10 articles in the series that are just

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
like goal maybe

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,090
Oh

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:59,960
all right so okay thank you me anytime

00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,960
