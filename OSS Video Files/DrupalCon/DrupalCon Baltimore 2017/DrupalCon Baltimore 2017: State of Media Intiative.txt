I'm Naveen valachia I work with appear

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,780
professional services as senior software

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,609
engineer and I am with Drupal I am

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,390
working with Drupal from last six years

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,070
and I am grouper or dot of project

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,410
application approver and the maintainer

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,189
of groups local dot oh oh hey my name is

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,300

engineer the lightning distribution I

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,680
maintain the migrate subsystem in core

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,510
probably the media system in core as

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,489
well or I wouldn't be up here I guess

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,430
I've been doing Drupal for a little over

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,410
a decade I may be the most histrionic

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,960
first on IRC possibly a true book on

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,469
will see and then Sean do you wanna

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,079
introduce yourself a bit sneaky neros

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,079
yeah so we have Sean in over Skype

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,210
thanks for cool so we're just going to

00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,590
talk a little bit about like the media

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,810
initiative kind of how we got to where

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,079
we're at now and where we're going and

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,799
how you can help get us there so it

00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,479
being take it away male so this is more

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,450
about the session so if you have any

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,969
questions in the middle let us know

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,100
there is Drupal 8 right now

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:43,500
couplet we have this port for the local

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,479
files and images we have file and email

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,330
module in the core itself which do

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,000
provide the spot for the local images

00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,340
and the file and other document size we

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,489
have this port for the responsive images

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,770
we have breakpoint and responsive module

00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,829
available in the core and we have this

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,619
port for the le features and the

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:07,679
embedding of the images in vasilek from

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,660
the ckeditor plugin and we and file

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:14,670
module also provides a nice listing of

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,430
the files using of use nice things that

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,489
we don't have in the core right now we

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,609
could not reuse the media we don't have

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,310
any site-wide by library right now we

00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:28,769
could not organize the media in folders

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,130
or in the categories we don't have this

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:34,799
port for the remote media similarly with

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,069
field-level files as well and we could

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,139
not upload the multiple files in one go

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:42,239
we have in the Contra space we have the

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:48,720
solution right now PL applauded for that

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,609
but not in the core so just a brief we

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,500
saw modular and a lot of this is coming

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,859
from a survey that was done a little

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,590
while ago your eyes right here sorry so

00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,730
a lot of this information is coming from

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,840
a survey that was done a little while

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,220
ago URLs right there basically asking

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,260
people what is it that we want to have

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,730
in core what do we need in what kind of

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,139
media support this Drupal need and the

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,840
responses were quite interesting and a

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,730
lot of this stuff is nice stuff that

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,290
people kind of more or less expect that

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,739
we just don't have and it's hard to it

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,760
can be hard to get that stuff in without

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,390
contributions and possibly some custom

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,880
hacking as well

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:30,459
good Adam so first some media growth in

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,340
the core from grouper six we have the

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,709
upload module available which allows us

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,680
to attach the files through the up node

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,020
and in the country's space we have the

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,500
CC came file field CCK and the image

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,180
field circuit and in the also the image

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,010
cache module available for the image

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,930
processing and the IMC module so so the

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,320
transition happened from the Drupal 6 to

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,660
Drupal 7 is like we move the the C CK

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,050
file field as a file module in the core

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,000
and this is CK image field from the

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,450
country space to the image module in the

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,180
core and we are the image cache module

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,730
in the Drupal 6 from the contras space

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,980
has been moved to the image tiles but

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,530
there are them there are more nice

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,239
features in the Drupal 7 X in the

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,960
contrary space we have the responsive

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,790
images and the picture break 2 for the

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
picture and require picture and break

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,750
point contributed modules and there are

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,060
there too there were the two ways to use

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,140
of the media to achieve of the media

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,870
functionality in the Drupal 7 we had the

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,450
file entity and the media entity media

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,520
not media exactly the medium of media

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,130
module in the drupal 7 which would allow

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,390
us all to all these reusing of the media

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,070
and the site weight media library yep

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,919
three weeks ago three weeks before that

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,550
media 7 point X got stable hand of

00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,550
applause for that

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,770
[Applause]

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,880
so in Drupal 7 we could achieve the more

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,500
advanced functionality using the couple

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,430
of the more contributed modules I will

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,890
give a brief Oh

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,650
brief about that because it's more of a

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,080
core conversation so this is the one one

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,120
of this the media CK Reader which which

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,640
works like a bridge between the media

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,950
module and the ckeditor module itself so

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,860
it allows files to be invented within

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,990
the text area of the seek editor using

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,620
that Media Browser one and we have the

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,890
media

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:42,220
one medium bad one it's more of an API

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,130
module so so it provides the API for the

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,670
remote media like YouTube Instagram

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,920
Twitter and Flickr and Sean and we have

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,230
the PL applaud for the uploading

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,270
multiple files and we have the entity

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,090
embed module available in the quantity

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,810
space to embed the entities into the

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,450
ckeditor

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:06,040
and there are ten ten different ways to

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,660
ten more than ten different ways to crop

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,930
the images couple of them are image

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:15,490
field crop manual crop I am see crop and

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:18,420
many more but in Drupal 7 we have the

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,120
two big players file entity

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,360
hello thank you

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,730
interpolate it yeah we have the two big

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
players file entity and the media entity

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,800
file entity followed the same concept of

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,990
that Drupal seven does so we have the

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,850
field label files so everything we don't

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,370
didn't have this port for the remote

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,610
media however like media entity is the

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,430
media entity provides it's all all on

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,640
API itself so it's provides a base base

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,310
entity of media the like we could

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,540
reference all kinds of media objects

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:58,750
like Twitter Instagram and different

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,540
types of photos videos media entity

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,310
provides provides us the provides of

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,580
relation between the grouper and the

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,820
media media resource so it's a Content

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,240
entity in itself so this module provides

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,010
through the provides a base storage

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,590
component for the Drupal media ecosystem

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:22,150
so this media entity in the contrary

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:24,610
space has a solid solid solid foundation

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,380
base in the Contra space because and the

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,630
couple of the distribution has proven

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,480
that the it has the solid foundation

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,970
base

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,660
so there are Drupal 8 more contrabassoon

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,090
s we have the entity browser module in

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,680
the contrary quantitive space see the

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,590
goal of this module is to provide a

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,450
generic solution for embedding like a

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,000
selector or pick up something so it's

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,630
like an entity reference widget so we

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,110
could embed

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,100
entities into the V Civic module next

00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,630
embed module it's it's an API in itself

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,880
so if you so it's so it's out of the box

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,770
it doesn't do anything so any contry

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,720
module will have to implement the API

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,820
and mail in this the entity embedded and

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,910
the URL embed are the dependent module

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,070
of that embed one so we could embed the

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,090
entities using that entity embed and we

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,880
could embed the own

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:25,060
embed objects into the ckeditor using

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,760
the URL embed module we we have the

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,790
inline entity form in the country space

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,470
as well so it's provides free widget for

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,320
the inline management of the content

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:40,750
entities entities we will see slice use

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:43,900
case in the Thunderer video later crop

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,560
api uh it's an API module just to send

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,140
at IG image crop API storage this module

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,950
would not do much by itself user should

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,770
pick up any of the UI module that that

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,740
should utilize its API and the focal

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,840
point and image crop widget these

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,440
modules allows us to focal point allows

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,080
us to specify the specific portion of

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,850
the image that is most important this

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,470
information can be used to that the

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,970
images crop or the crop crop or save

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,610
scale at the whatever the configuration

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,950
that we will provide so image image

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,290
widget CRO provides this whole

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:29,020
configuration at the widget level of the

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:32,890
image field so here we go drop down the

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,930
drop down drop John J's module so it's

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,980
pro exploit the integration with the

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,400
drop zone layers

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,790
J's library so it's provides the drag

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,610
and drop of the file uploads with the

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,220
image Pro gives and we have the fallback

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,640
formatter module which allows multiple

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,530
formatters to be used for display it

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,510
provides a few field formatter that can

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,690
attempt multiple formatters and the

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,510
first one that returns output will gain

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,879
it's similar like this tax services

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,369
interpolate

00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,679
field formatter another one is the field

00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:10,269
formatter it was it generate its provide

00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:15,129
the collection of generic format us or

00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:18,149
entity reference fields that that output

00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:21,459
a specific field to the reference entity

00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,739
yep we have the distributions in

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,139
contrary space in Drupal eight media

00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:28,269
which has proven that the Drupal eight

00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:31,540
media entity in the contrib space has a

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:34,269
solid solid foundations so we have

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,949
Thunder and the lightning distribution

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:39,639
so thunder shifts with couple of the

00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:41,559
media modules is fewer me image

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,189
Instagram Twitter and the slideshow and

00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,410
many more so thunders over right third

00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:50,079
has its own feature for the media's as

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,679
well so which provides the media

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:57,399
experience out of the box let me run

00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,699
this video here we will see the nice use

00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,699
case

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:19,709
really we have we could Tunde

00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:24,490
we can mute it but I could explain yep

00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:25,779
so here if the Thunder distribution

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,629
comes with the couple of the media

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,699
bundles out of the box so these these

00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,540
are the media vendors we which comes

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:37,329
comes from the meet the Thunder features

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,910
so here it comes comes with the media

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:44,220
listings here is a media listing page

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,220
which couple of different type of media

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:52,329
go so here we will see that it's we are

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,860
going to create any of the type of the

00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:58,779
media so that we could so that it would

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:07,089
get saved to the media library and we

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:11,620
could reuse it later could increase the

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:13,240
speed yep here like different type of

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,720
tweeter media we just need to provide

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,720
the tweet for this link of this tweet

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,069
oh it's the media main patch our TV seal

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,069
two days before

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:45,130
so here is a different type of media

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,230
it's the YouTube one and we are going to

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:51,010
use we are gonna reference this one in

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,900
the article content so it's live so it

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,060
Thunder comes with the nice flavor of

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,330
that inline entity form and the

00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:07,780
paragraph one here we'll see it later

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:11,730
yep here these are just the normal text

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,730
fields and reference fields

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,810
so we are adding the

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:44,390
probably lightning like the pointing

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,960
made here is just like here we are going

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,610
to yeah here we are going to reuse that

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,890
existing video from the media library

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:57,430
which is also one of the target for that

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,430
media initiative

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,380
so we could add as many as configuration

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,380
as per requirement

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:20,160
is too slow actually be preyed on by the

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,660
half now

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,660
yeah it's about

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,629
so it's unpublished now so after

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,629
publishing it we will see

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,350
so we have the different type of media

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,480
which we have referred in this

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:06,480
particular note so here's the nice

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,480
gallery yep

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,880
and that Thunder we lost

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:22,340
whew yep here's a lightning that really

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,950
well do you want to garden the job good

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,480
molar to Adam for millennia yeah

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,890
lightning is another distribution a

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,600
little bit more sparse than thunder it

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,250
shifts with a lot of the same stuff it

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,780
has the media entity module plus a bunch

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,060
of it's integrations but like Instagram

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,560
Twitter files and stuff like that it has

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,310
a Media Browser that's built on top of

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,220
entity browser

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:43,760
it has bulk uploads with drop zone J s

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,470
and some fun helper api's that will

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:51,190
improve the developer experience as well

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:53,800
and it's wizard approved so you know um

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,570
so yeah Devine also put together a video

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,770
demonstrating lightning really quickly

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,050
it is kind of some of its functionality

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:03,230
here and the reason I'm showing you this

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,570
just I want to explain is this is a lot

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,010
of this kind of inspires our approach to

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,500
putting media in core and kind of what

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,870
the MVP has been is what these two

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,730
distros and others as well have put

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,000
together using the contributing the

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,770
parts from contributing you know like

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,980
exactly with under it ships with a bunch

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,030
of media types right out of a box to use

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,870
and you know what I'm going to speed the

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:31,790
video up also in this one because why

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:34,700
not oh there we go okay it has a media

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,670
library exactly the way thunder does it

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,340
actually comes with media entity so I'm

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:47,150
sorry didn't like posit or something

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:49,960
wait damn it this is why I have to like

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,960
not press the things

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:58,400
yeah so yeah oh my god I did it again

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,750
now what so we should move on with this

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,490
yeah forget it you can see the videos

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,770
later to slide the flies URLs on the

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,940
front we only have some time and I want

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,660
to be able to have some discussion in

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,160
here so whatever point is lightning and

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,720
thunder both do things with media with

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,770
the contributes and it's pretty slick so

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,210
let's talk about the media initiative

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,570
and how we can actually get some of this

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:27,840
slick media stuff into core um and how

00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:30,390
we're going to go about doing that so we

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,900
have the media initiative it's a fully

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,310
approved full steam ahead initiative the

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,120
goals of which are pretty

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,040
straightforward we want the basic normal

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,020
kind of intuitive media handling

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,120
experiences you would get in just about

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,760
any CMS that you would I would think you

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,230
would expect that in most CMS's like

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
because this is Drupal we want to

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,540
probably go a little bit further than

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,660
that we want to provide an API in core

00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,240
for integrating many different media

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,850
services many different media types with

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,770
a really just robust rock-solid flexible

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,590
API because you know Drupal this is what

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,000
we do you know by the same token the

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,760
functionality that we want to ship with

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,290
core will be fairly limited you know we

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,550
don't want to support too many things

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,800
out of the box

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,660
that's what contributes for and we also

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,820
want to be able to integrate with

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,580
third-party media services digital asset

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,850
management stuff like that fairly easily

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,360
using the core API s so there's I'm

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:34,230
going to wear this with my water here it

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,710
is so there's gonna be three phases of

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,600
this initiative the first one is our MVP

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,580
which is we're calling it the essentials

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,560
and the goals there are we're going to

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,090
just kind of we're going to have a media

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,500
API in core we're going to define what

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,170
that API looks like you know what the

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,490
classes are how you use them and then on

00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,380
top of that the first thing we're going

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,660
to do is build functionality that will

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,540
essentially mirror what the core file

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,560
and image modules already do just on top

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,270
of media entities and media types and

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,540
kind of the media API rather than just

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,290
using

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,330
files directly we're also going to add a

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,890
module that implements a basic media

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,350
library so that you can you know in

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,050
ckeditor you can call up all the media

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,150
you have you can choose ones to use in

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,980
like nodes or whatever for entity

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,460
references to media I'm gonna demo that

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,080
and we want to also provide support out

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,730
of the box for like om bed providers

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,050
like YouTube Vimeo

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,840
I think Instagram might be one as well

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,810
there's a bunch to just be able to embed

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,180
remote media very very simply and easily

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:39,630
out of the box we're targeting most if

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,130
not all this stuff for Drupal 8.4 we

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,890
also want to have WYSIWYG embedding

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:47,270
which maybe 8.5 I think we want it in

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,860
8.4 I can't remember the details but

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,920
yeah we in other words we want all this

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,110
we wanted as soon as possible we're also

00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,390
going to have the second phase which is

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,460
extras and that is basically going to be

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,140
taking place all infant rib it's more

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,090
shiny stuff and advanced functionality

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,210
so like really cool cropping multiple

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,820
uploads advanced embedding I don't know

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,660
you name it this is all going to be

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,100
contribs

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,440
built on top of the core media system

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,780
with an eye towards possible adoption in

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,910
core eventually because you know things

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,680
do as you know things that we liked from

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,570
contribute end to make it into core in

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,280
some form so that's what extra is kind

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:36,630
of is about its concentrating efforts to

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:38,100
build those things and to wit we already

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,280
have all these cool modules for you know

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,990
from the d8 ecosystem parts of which may

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,910
go into core or at least inspire things

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,800
in core you know like Naveen already

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,020
described things like embed entity embed

00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,570
which are embedding any entity into like

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,760
CK editor drop zone for you know

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,490
drag-and-drop uploads cropping etc etc

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,520
so these may all be part these may all

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,800
become part of the media extras package

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,600
for lack of a better word and the third

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,240
part of the initiative is the extend

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,190
part and the idea here is really about

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,430
integrating with third-party media

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,870
services with digital asset management

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,399
asset management things

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,850
their reason for which is like Drupal

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:19,559
you know Drupal is great but third-party

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,809
media services may be able to handle the

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,509
really complicated stuff like licensing

00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,649
adverts you know geo restrictions stuff

00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,210
like that they might be able to just do

00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:29,700
a better job so we should have really

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,230
strong integration with those services

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,820
and that's what extend is all about it's

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,370
using the core API is to talk to

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,379
third-party media services Brightcove

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,210
might be the proof of concept we don't

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,159
really we haven't planned this one out

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,759
too far yet we're more focused on the

00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,990
essentials at this point and so I'll

00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,600
talk a little bit about kind of how the

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,480
architecture of this is put together the

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,369
important things to know is that we're

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,139
basically taking the media entity module

00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:58,669
importing it into core as the media

00:21:55,139 --> 00:22:01,320
module so we're taking that namespace

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:04,230
media entities and core are not special

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,869
they're just normal content energies

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,759
they're things with fields attached and

00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:10,499
as you saw in the Thunder demo video

00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,909
it's you know creating a media entity is

00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,799
like making a node there's a form you

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:17,340
fill it out it works you know what do

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:19,320
you do they have media types which are

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,509
config entities just like nodes have

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,269
node types it's very very simple where

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:26,879
things get more interesting is on the

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:28,679
media a little bit of a departure from

00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,990
Drupal 7 here is that media are not

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,879
necessarily files media are more

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,740
abstract than that so media could refer

00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:36,509
to a soundcloud audio clip it could

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,799
refer to some snippet of text it could

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:39,629
refer to a tweet it could really refer

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,360
to anything and the things that are

00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:44,580
responsible for bridging that gap and

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,679
kind of standard of you know exposing to

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,990
Drupal in a standard way the important

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,600
information about any given piece of

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,639
media ID in a file or be it some web

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,399
resource is the source plugin and this

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:59,369
is a plug-in type exposed by the media

00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,409
module and it's responsible for doing

00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:06,029
exactly that is the bridge between some

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:07,799
media of some kind and Drupal each media

00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,450
type that you create is associated with

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,179
one source plug-in they're responsible

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,340
for all of the logic about how to storm

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,570
like how media is stored is it stored on

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,340
the web somewhere is it sort of the

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,590
local file system that's up to the

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,230
source plugin validation getting

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,000
metadata about each about some piece of

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,020
media they're all responsible for that

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,130
and that's really kind of the

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,750
that's really the important stuff that

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,030
you need to know about the coremedia

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,140
architecture everything else about it if

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,650
you read the patch which I don't

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,980
recommend it's 7,000 lines but I did it

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,600
I really don't recommend it if you read

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,730
it though like everything in there is

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,420
pretty normal pretty standard this is

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,429
the interesting stuff so as I said it's

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,850
the media entity module renamed media

00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,320
moved into core we're going to merge

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:59,070
functionality from the contributing

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,350
entity image module in there and the

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,630
idea there is so that media will come

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,000
with support for files and images out of

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,770
the box and the reason we're doing that

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,440
is so that we can have very quick parity

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,669
with the core file and image modules

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,480
which have a slightly different approach

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:13,919
to this stuff

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,350
we're also going to include a source

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,630
plug-in that implements support for Oh

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,299
embed so that we have something a little

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,980
bit cooler than just oh hey here's file

00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:25,650
and image here's media with file and

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,360
image support which I use you know it's

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,250
going to be out of the gate beta

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,740
experimental which means the API will be

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:37,169
stable and if the rest of our MVP isn't

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,480
in core by Drupal 8.4 we're just going

00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:42,240
to hide it so you'll still be able to

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,950
use it but yeah so it's a little bit of

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,850
an interesting situation there but

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,750
that's what's going to be then

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,700
additionally we're going to provide the

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,650
media library module which will be

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,450
experimental and that's going to be

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,480
built on top of media and it implements

00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,059
a very well you'll see it's a UI for

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,240
selecting and reusing media very simple

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,850
we're also going to want to have a

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,460
migration path from from core file and

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,169
image fields because the underlying

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,669
storage is different so if you want to

00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,410
have if you have file and image fields

00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,059
and data in those fields and you want to

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,620
switch them over to using the media

00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,419
system there's going to need to be a

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:22,290
migration path for that hopefully not

00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,540
too complicated so the media library I

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:27,240
want to talk about that a little bit

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,370
it's well you didn't see what lightning

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,110
does you did see what thunder does very

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,360
briefly it's a pared down version of

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,160
what they do with entity browser energy

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,040
browser is a really really complex

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,870
module that's super duper powerful we

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,460
don't need that much power

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,440
so it's a pared down version of that

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,880
it's not an API it's not going to be

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,890
like something that you extend it's just

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,410
like going to be there but it is

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,809
customizable it's based on on a view

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,040
that it comes with and a view mode that

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:54,600
it comes with and you can change those

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,160
things change the way media looks in

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,680
your library change the way you filter

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,570
media stuff like that it will also have

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,480
a new field widget which will be used

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,300
with entity reference fields that

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,800
reference media items and which

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,510
therefore know how to like call up the

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,790
library and talk to it and like interact

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,620
with it and stuff inline entity creation

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,260
is not going to be supported yet at

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,240
least and by that I mean stuff like you

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,190
know imagine a modal where you have your

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
library and you have a tab that says

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,120
upload or create from embed code and it

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,150
just creates the media right they're not

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,950
going to be in this at least not yet

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,750
lightning and thunder both have that

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,510
though so you know if you need that use

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,150
them this is a screenshot of what it

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:41,429
looks like but I think I would I would

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:43,080
demo it for you at this point so what we

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,090
have is this is a Drupal eight point

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,830
four point X dev with all the patches

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,800
applied and I've tested it so I know it

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,610
will probably work with being this being

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:56,420
at live demo so what I have here is a

00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:00,570
normal entity reference field that is

00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,340
referencing media items and it's using

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,110
the special widget that is provided by

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:08,010
the media library module so if I click

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,230
add media I get this view Animoto

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,550
it's just as a normal view you could

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,610
totally change this add more filters

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,880
remove filters you know rebuild it

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:22,020
entirely if you want to do and I can

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:27,270
choose media to use from my cheeky

00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,010
collection of memes in my field and you

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,140
know there you go ok I selected them I

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,970
can actually see them which is I can

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,740
reorder them with drag and drop which is

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,940
in my view kind of a step up from what

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,820
we've had remove things and you know

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:47,740
there you go so pretty basic pretty

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:51,809
intuitive going to be in core yeah

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,809
[Applause]

00:27:52,400 --> 00:28:03,030
and there was much rejoicing so having

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,620
gone into that a couple of URLs that you

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,480
may find interesting the UI we have a

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,670
live clickable kind of interactive UI

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,800
prototype of kind of what we want the

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,060
media library to become this what you

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,500
just saw was really kind of a proof of

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:18,150
concept that we hacked together in

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,010
Berlin in a week the UI prototype is a

00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,330
little bit more involved a little bit

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,400
more advanced so you feel free to check

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,840
that out there was the issue where they

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,220
designed the prototype if you really

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,770
care about reading a lot of bike

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,080
shedding this you can check out and then

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,070
the main issue that has the patch

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,080
containing the experimental media

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:42,330
library module as it currently exists is

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:45,810
the last URL there so sorry so the way

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,400
this looks altogether is we have several

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:51,090
very distinct issues we have to attack

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,230
in a very very specific order in which

00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,220
we have to attack them

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:59,550
the current the main thing we're waiting

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,440
on right now is the main the big 7,000

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,780
line patch that brings the media module

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,920
into core and the media API that's

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,870
currently our TBC so we are very has

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,520
been you know been working on it for

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,990
like five months so we're really really

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,460
hoping to get that in soon if we're

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,680
lucky it'll be during this Drupal con

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,490
but don't you know you didn't hear it

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,590
from me after we have that we're going

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,630
to very quickly move to get parity with

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,690
file and image module since those are

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,150
probably the most we think it's the most

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,520
common use case it's like the 80% use

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,050
case so first will be a file source

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,930
plug-in then will be an image plug-in

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,610
which extends that parallel for that

00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,080
we'll do an O embed plugin which is sort

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,530
of slightly lower priority since it's

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,120
new once we have the file and image

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,370
source plugins we want to have widgets

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,900
which work with media things but

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,850
essentially emulate the file and image

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,080
widgets that we know and love and then

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,230
for matters that do the same meanwhile

00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,360
once the main patch is in we can start

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,740
refactoring and re-rolling and fixing up

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,559
the media library to actually get that

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,009
in

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:10,450
so basically it looks good and these are

00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:13,389
the issues in question you know come

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,929
back to the slides and copy the ni DS if

00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:18,309
you really want to read them and there's

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:19,779
a lot of follow ups from the main patch

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:22,149
but these are really the important ones

00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:28,799
and these make up the bulk of our MVP

00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:32,429
for Drupal 8.4 if you have a module that

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,749
already integrates with media entity or

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:37,269
you have custom code that integrates

00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:39,070
with it or something like that you will

00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,230
probably want to be porting your module

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,149
to the core media API when it lands we

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,940
wrote a change record for that which is

00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:48,159
really really easy to follow it's just

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,249
like rename this to this stop calling

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,299
this change this reference to that you

00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,460
know you'll be done in ten minutes

00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:58,119
depending on how good your code is I

00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:02,200
guess um it could it could get gnarly

00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:04,269
man so what's next well get the main

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,159
patch into core number one everybody

00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,869
agrees we need to do that parody with

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,090
file and image get the media library

00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,820
done then we start getting into the

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:18,100
extras ecosystem refactor things on top

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:23,200
of the core media API and you know

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,700
improve upon that and eventually get rid

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,350
of media entity give it a hero's funeral

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,200
put it out to see whatever we got to do

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,700
with it I don't know and you know and

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,330
start integrating with third-party

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,799
services and just kind of generally make

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,139
the things happen that we've all wanted

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,419
to have happen and have not been able to

00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:44,440
do except with monkey patching contribs

00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:47,649
together so if you would like to help

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,110
with this we meet in IRC every Wednesday

00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:51,580
at 2 o'clock Greenwich Mean Time the

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,679
contacts the people who know the most

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,899
are Sean who has has been very very

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,600
quiet on skype maybe he fell asleep I

00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:04,960
don't know he's in the Netherlands me

00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:06,669
myself Ben approximate a V so we all

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,909
hang out in the Drupal media room and

00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:13,419
you can talk to us we also have a sprint

00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:15,190
for this stuff on Friday we also really

00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:16,480
like front Enders and UX people that

00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,070
media library is

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,750
is not going to look good if just

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,820
engineers are putting it together in my

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,370
view so if you're a front-end or UX

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:36,580
person we want we want you to help us

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:37,870
please and that's it uh yeah okay wait

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:43,540
you want to come to the mic so it's

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:44,919
recorded lighting that you will show the

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,540
complexity of the entity browser

00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,700
enlightening yeah I could do it the

00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,160
better well I asked a faster question

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,910
first if you want no really want to show

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,470
the video quick let's do in a bit I have

00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,230
we have questions already I just want to

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:03,880
hear from people you sure you want to

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:05,200
see the video okay it's not a live demo

00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm not sure maybe I'm afraid it somehow

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,990
won't work YouTube will stop working

00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:18,429
okay hmm

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,250
oh yeah I'll increase the speed and then

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:24,179
I won't touch anything because last time

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:28,600
I did that nothing worked right

00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:33,669
so yeah the lightening video we got some

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,460
bundles images tweets videos documents

00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:40,809
general file stuff like that very very

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,700
similar to thunder if you go to the

00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,830
media tab under content you have the

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,390
media the view of your media which this

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,070
as I said it comes with media entity

00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,320
it's just a view you can change it

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,240
filter it however you want and if you

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,070
add media it's like adding a node you

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,770
choose the type you enter some required

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,150
stuff one thing lightning does do a

00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,860
little bit differently is it try to

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,510
generate live previews of things that

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,730
are based on embed codes so things like

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,320
tweets will instantly show up videos

00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,330
also instantly show up I think that's in

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,340
the video somewhere

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,530
instagrams to stuff like that and then

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,879
you choose you just select the check box

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,000
to have it save into your media library

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,200
the idea being to support one-off uses

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,359
of media works like well I just want to

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,790
use this one time you know don't really

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,060
want to reuse it video works the same

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:28,600
way as tweets do except that it has a

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,190
really really dumb bug where the preview

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,010
appears

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,359
the entire size of the paste maybe I

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:38,040
should fix that one of these days I

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,440
don't know and yeah it's so creating

00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,909
media under media entity is really

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,280
really straightforward

00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,290
we're lightning gets really cool is in

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,540
reusing it we have integration with

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,079
ckeditor through entity embed and the

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,460
embed module we also are so that's a

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,909
media reference field right there it's

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,740
using our Media Browser to call up stuff

00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,700
that's in the media library and allows

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,859
you to select it

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,540
it also has these upload and create

00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:06,780
embed tabs which I don't know if you can

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,640
see but the idea there is to be able to

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,730
create media in line right there from

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,710
within the browser but yes so here we

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,270
have a field that supports referencing

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,609
media we have obviously selected some

00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,460
stuff did you do a piece with the

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:21,569
ckeditor part or no okay well I guess

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,060
you don't get to see that unless you

00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:25,920
install lightning but you can also do

00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,319
this exact same workflow with the Media

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,050
Browser from seek editors button that

00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:33,180
looks like a star so yeah that's a

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,440
really fast rundown of lightnings

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:41,130
integration a little more sparse than

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:43,020
thunders but questions yeah so so let's

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,359
say I have some sites that I've built

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,619
with Drupal 8 core some sites that are

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,380
built with lightning some sites that

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,359
I've built with thunder what sort of

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,450
experience should I expect to have as we

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,839
go through this process of putting media

00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,010
in core well all the things that those

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,800
all have in common is they're all built

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,599
on top of media entity so it sounds to

00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,300
me like you would expect to have more or

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,980
less the same experience as you update

00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,470
to core media and there's going to be

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,960
update paths like a smooth update path

00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,760
because the good news is while while

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,880
building the core media module we didn't

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,700
change the data model for media it's

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,310
really just the api's that changed so

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,940
it's a pretty safe update path famous

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,829
last words

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,630
but I think it's going to be pretty

00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:29,490
smooth and pretty easy and and so then

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,589
like for example something like

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,930
lightning is there anything that's

00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:37,319
currently built into lightning that I we

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,609
might lose along the way no and the

00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,250
reason for that is that lightning

00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:42,820
particularly um we're not going to

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,619
regress functionality

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,000
you know when we switch to coremedia

00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,619
we're going to be switching to coremedia

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,349
under the hood but we want everything to

00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:55,599
continue to work the way that it does

00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:57,940
because it's awesome so basically you

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,630
can expect things to continue to be

00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,190
awesome and awesomer as we take

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,280
advantage of the new stuff in core oh

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,420
great yeah can't speak for thunder

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,430
though but I think they probably tell

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,400
you the same thing

00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:14,950
um this is a this is a little bit own

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,220
though in the weeds but on a bunch of

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:20,650
projects recently we've been making like

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,950
basically subclassed entity reference

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,839
field types to do special stuff that

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,940
needed to happen like usually it's

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,880
things like overriding the title of an

00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,410
article in the specific place where it's

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,540
being referenced and stuff like that oh

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,930
yeah but the one thing that we've run

00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:40,180
into is media you know the entity

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,380
reference picker libraries all those

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,320
things we have to go through and like

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,440
right subclasses for every single widget

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,089
that might be used and I'm seeing other

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,430
similar projects starting to emerge as

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:53,859
people like say I can do crazy things

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,589
with subclass entity references is there

00:37:53,859 --> 00:38:00,069
anyone that would be a good person to

00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:04,599
talk to about like the potential for I

00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:07,210
mean not like in the 8.4 release but the

00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,540
ongoing potential for making sure that

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:14,859
like picker widgets and stuff like that

00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:17,950
play nicely with entity reference plus

00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:19,780
some extra kinds of fields that people

00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,390
are doing we're like what they do would

00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,690
work fine if they could somehow just

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,700
know I can put my reference data in

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,190
there well that sounds like a backwards

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,660
compatibility questions so to me it's

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,270
like the Mott the authors of those

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,520
modules on or of those classes that's

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,890
your sub classing if they care at all

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,609
about backwards compatibility and damn

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:44,200
they should but if they do then they'll

00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:46,480
make sure that you can subclass things

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,250
and they can change things and not break

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,780
stuff we're all the same method should

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,160
still be available I guess I mean like

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,420
the way right now widgets they have to

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,910
know explicit

00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:02,140
about field types that they can interact

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,430
with yeah unless I mean unless you like

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,849
create a subclass version or something

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,920
like that

00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:10,539
maybe I'll just I'll just corner you and

00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,549
in like the sprit room or something like

00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,490
that but it gets doable I think

00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:17,589
especially as d8 continues I think

00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,390
that's a pattern we're going to see a

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:22,150
whole lot of and it would be cool if the

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:27,339
overhead of integrating with special

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:29,559
kinds of widgets got less arduous so I'm

00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,940
very interested in those okay yeah we

00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,440
can we can totally go into the weeds on

00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,349
thank you yeah absolutely

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,579
I love hanging out in the weeds so one

00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:37,809
of the things our client a couple of our

00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:40,869
clients have been asking for is the

00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:44,260
ability to remove images and files from

00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:47,109
the system mm-hmm which is not quite as

00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:49,299
easy yet yeah triple-eight wise is is

00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,559
that under this initiative since its

00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,849
files or is it something else

00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,930
when you say remove files and images

00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,640
from the system you mean like the

00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,079
physical files from the file system they

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,880
want they want to be able to delete to

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,849
delete the image or the file like on the

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,079
files tab and have it be gone don't like

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:07,329
the Englishmen yeah I don't think you

00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,710
can do that right now they can um well

00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:10,119
the thing about I don't think media is

00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,369
really going to be affecting that and

00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,220
the reason I say that is because media

00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,210
is an abstraction layer above files and

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,789
stuff and that's really kind of

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,549
low-level file handling and core I think

00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:25,569
I mean it may clean it up somewhat and

00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:27,640
that's because I think files are under

00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:30,700
some like if they're marked a certain

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,619
way um they're like automatically

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,630
removed on by cron after a certain

00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:39,329
period or something well there's a file

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,329
usage yeah a pile usage table exactly

00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:44,799
yeah Jess might have better answers on

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,539
this one yeah that's I was just made

00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:48,130
aware of that issue yesterday like good

00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:51,910
I mean the thing the reason that might

00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,480
be oh so the recording one just picked

00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:58,880
up what was just that about what

00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:00,530
oh okay no go ahead um so there are

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,830
currently several critical issues where

00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:05,900
a Drupal will delete files for you even

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,760
if maybe you didn't want them to be

00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,640
because there's a number of but turns

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,910
out tracking file usages on a website

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,160
where you can enter any kind of HTML in

00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,900
any kind of field anywhere is it

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,690
actually it's a very very difficult

00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,340
problem solved so there are a number of

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,750
critical issues in the core key right

00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,030
now and the solution that we've settled

00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,310
on is probably actually that we are

00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,760
going to stop automatically cleaning up

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,800
files give the user the option to to

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,810
manually remove a file and with like a

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,240
views bulk operation view potentially

00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,859
and deprecated the entire concept of

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,350
file usage tracking we might show you

00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:45,590
like we think this file used in three

00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,630
places but if you delete it media does

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,400
also help actually resolve is

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:54,140
conceptually in a way because instead of

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,540
needing to track like every when you use

00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,250
media you've made a choice to embed the

00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,900
media and when you're deleting the media

00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,730
you're doing the media thing right right

00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,580
so maybe it's the only thing using the

00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,710
file and and you you only would run into

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,050
you at least you wouldn't run into the

00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,119
problem with a like we're not going to

00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,710
automatically purge your media for you

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,930
because you wrote that on the site for a

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,700
reason yeah that's that's what the

00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,070
backstory is there for people who don't

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,480
follow the quarry issue great wish you

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,960
counter every day of their lives

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,880
might need help people yeah so basically

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,690
it'll help but it's a little bit out of

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,790
scope for media specifically yes

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,800
my question had to do with the file

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,510
browser I noticed you said that it was

00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,890
basically going to be a view which I

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,740
agree is very powerful way of

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,109
approaching it I'm wondering how much

00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:44,890
thought you put into turning that into

00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:48,440
an API instead those so that you can

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:51,050
browse the the content that exists in a

00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,140
dam or some other external system two

00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,820
words entity browser it is very that

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,369
this is exactly what the kind of thing

00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,170
that any browser was built to solve the

00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:02,030
module entity browser actually reminds

00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,240
me the most of at the API level and I

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:07,120
say this in a nice way is views in the

00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,040
sends it like everything about an inch

00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,540
browser is based on plugins that can do

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,010
pretty much whatever you want if you

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,330
want to like implement integration with

00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,480
them or like you know some kind of

00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,100
special sauce stuff so for advanced

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,900
cases like that definitely enter the

00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,380
browser okay and I will continue to be

00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:30,330
stabilizing in contribs so yeah any

00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:46,900
other questions answers complaints No

00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:48,970
all right Miller time if you want to

00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,010
help with the media initiative you can

00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:53,590
come to the contribution Sprint's on

00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,660
Friday as Adams gestures just indicated

00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,130
um if you've never contributed to core

00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,810
before there is a workshop that will

00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,160
help you set up your development

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,020
environment and teach you how to

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,420
navigate the core issue queue there are

00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,860
mentored sprints where you can work with

00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,540
a group of people to collaborate and

00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,220
finally there will also be if you're

00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,360
like I don't need help setting up my

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,120
development environment you can find

00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,690
Adam add presumably a media initiative

00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,690
