00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,290
who is it that you are thinking about

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,540
when you were designing your digital

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,830
experience so we have one microphone

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,930
unfortunately so we have to kind of like

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,070
play past the mic but why is that word

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,670
salute can you hear me okay so hi

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,580
everyone I work for Princess Cruises

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,030
introduced and we have 18 cruise ships

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:30,130
and we are serving 1.7 million

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:32,860
passengers so what we do for Prince is

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,730
what I do for principal my team here so

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,580
we build the customer portal for all the

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,980
guests traveling with us as well as the

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,160
crew crew applications to support the

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,230
customers so the the we build the

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,350
application mainly for our guests and

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,000
then partially my objective is also to

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,690
make an application which works for a

00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,550
crew to support the guests what we do in

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:04,120
a variety of ways right from the guests

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,970
personal devices to digital signage is

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,599
printed newsletters as well as you know

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,260
the

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,549
room service and every interaction they

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,259
have Drupal place of role and our

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,289
application per control it's a suite of

00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:22,990
applications that we work with and the

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:26,800
customers being using the applications

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,900
of the major goal for us and the next

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,419
part is helping the crew members uses

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,770
the application promoter us with the

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:37,300
customers that's only where we can

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:41,169
succeed and so we have breakfast

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,630
ordering through our application and the

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,389
crew application that helps delivery of

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,180
breakfast so we in fact do 400-500

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,639
breaks first in the morning every day so

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,500
such things of application that we help

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,539
we have operational operational

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,020
supporting tools that we support so we

00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:03,190
think the crew members the shipboard

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,720
management who we need to support so

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,490
that they can help the customer have a

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,940
better cruise experience travel

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,180
experience so those are our customers

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:16,000
thanks Dave thank you hi my name is Dave

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,620
blade I work for Comcast perhaps some of

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,349
you've heard of Comcast were a small

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,849
media technology telecommunications

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,280
company we do about sixty billion

00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,289
dollars a year in business and I work

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,449
for a very small team called strategic

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:30,190
development and our focus and steady

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,470
development is to act as a sort of a

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,289
skunkworks or a an incubator for new

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,470
business ideas for Comcast and right now

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,780
the team that I'm on we're working on

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:46,470
seeing how we can leverage our core

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:49,210
assets technology internet and

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:53,860
information to help hospitals and

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:56,020
insurers provide services to people in

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,259
their home to extend what they call the

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,259
continuum of care from hospital to home

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,259
cool

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,090
so yep my name's Karl I think Steve you

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,640
did a good introduction so what flight

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:14,920
in a travel group is but our lab I'll

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:18,580
continue to talk about what I do so I

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,200
guess I manage about up to ninety

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,300
websites across the globe at the moment

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,370
we've got forty brands the the way that

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,780
we work is that our forty brands all

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,880
have a different customer experience

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,670
across each of the brand so it makes

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,050
things reusing things across different

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:39,010
sites quite hard especially from a

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,990
usability for anything my job has been

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,670
able to arms to basically build a

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,020
platform for each of these brands to

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,580
leverage as much as possible their

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,860
products and information and forms and

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,750
all that type of stuff to a point where

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,970
they can customize it so I have about

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,730
forty Drupal devs at the moment because

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,890
of that high lack of governance across

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,960
the brands and the way that they work so

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,320
each site has their own team and each

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,820
team has their own developers so it's

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:15,580
been a challenge but what we do is we

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,050
work with a whole bunch of different

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,480
levels of customer so we've got the end

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,180
user customer who interacts with the

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,730
site's makes inquiries around travel and

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,950
does their booking we have our internal

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,080
sites build as we call them not the

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,270
actual site developers site builders

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,100
people who build out the campaign pages

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,480
and all the tools that use Drupal we

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,240
have our consultants so they're the

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,610
people who receive the inquiries from

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,990
from the web sites and then we put our

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,900
marketing team so I've got model

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,120
multiple customers that I need to make

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:50,830
happy and it's a bit of fun but yeah

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,840
let's think and Steven said I work for

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,540

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,700
they've been broken out through PW media

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,800
and through Knack we are an education

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,220
company where we provide online and live

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,540
trainings and an LMS service and as

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,630
director of administration unfortunately

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,700
IP falls under that and only thing is

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,550
nobody else wants to do so I get to do

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,920
the i2 part of it as well thanks aunty

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,640
hold on for that so I'd like to start

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,490
off by thinking back at what the pain

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,040
points or the struggles the challenges

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,630
that you had sort of pre Drupal like

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,270
what were the things that really got

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,000
things moving and got the gears turning

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,660
on we need to make something happen here

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,300
you want to want to start with that

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,340
Brenden the pain points of our old

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,490
website when I first got to visit

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,320
Baltimore about five years ago we were I

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,890
was dealing with a six-year-old web site

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:18,020
that was that was built on a small

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:21,290
proprietary CMS when I first started

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,090
there my job was to start an RFP find

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,310
and I find an agency to help us review

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,870
our website that whole process got

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,449
pushed ahead

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,399
one day I received a call from the local

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:34,010
division of the FBI

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,070
apparently our website was blasting out

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:40,010
so much spam and and affecting so many

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,449
computers that the FBI called me and

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,709
said hey if you don't shut your website

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,130
down we're going to have some serious

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,779
issues

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,940
so the miles team was able to help us

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,199
eliminate a lot of those issues until we

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,800
were get it so we were able to get to a

00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:56,420
point to to rebuild the website and the

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,850
website build was actually pushed

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,350
forward because of this issue it got to

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,089
a point where it was either you know we

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,279
try and fix these issues or we shut down

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,290
the website and the team that we

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,370
partnered with was really help us was

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,269
really able to help us get off the

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,070
ground but it was an old CMS it was very

00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,490
convoluted very hard to work with and

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:22,399
the site in general was just very

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:25,430
unsecure as I pointed out there um yeah

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,839
we we had a we had an interesting piece

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:34,970
of machinery before Drupal come along so

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,850
we had some magical IBM Wickham CMS that

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,680
integrated with some custom crazy Java

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,370
back-end and the idea of that

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,529
architecture was around not giving

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,240
developers any power to help make

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,639
decisions for the customers it was all

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,949
just focus that they're around just

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,569
rendering content on the page lack of

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:55,250
touch it's supposed to be just for the

00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,810
business to get in there and they can

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,699
play around and put all these little

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,490
queries and that was the dream that was

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,740
sold what happened was as soon as the

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,500
business for quiet a pivot in their in

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,240
their customer experience it required

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,930
months and months of work on the back

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,459
end to actually get that out by the time

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,029
it did get there they didn't even

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,589
realize they requested that so one of

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,930
them at I guess the pain point is there

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,940
was the lead time was a big issue and I

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,579
think that's probably one of the things

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,050
that you know was overlooked at flights

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,910
and a travel group is the amount of time

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,620
it takes from an idea whether it was

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,440
good at bad most of them are bad to

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:37,550
actually going up to the customer and

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,740
actually validating that so with that

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,110
the way that was also built was

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,430
uninspiring so if you were a developer

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,780
and flight centers of about this

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,310
brightness of few team they've got to

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,190
look up to your people and then you

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,640
throw them throw on this thing we had a

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,750
very big turnover right so that's where

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,550
we went to look for something a little

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,720
bit more fun a little bit more inspiring

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,150
a little bit more touchy-feely I guess

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,220
because this was just a JavaScript to

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,600
run engine that the business had to play

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,730
with they had no idea what they are

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,180
doing so it was it was bloody horrible

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:16,030
so it's glad to get off it some

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:19,370
touchy-feely was running requirements I

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,930
guess they had a system our problem when

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,690
we didn't have a system at all if you

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,920
had no sister so if you think about a

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,390
cruise ship it is completely

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,160
disconnected from the real world and

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,670
when we call a cloud there's no cloud

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,380
it's the moment people come on board the

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,410
ship they set aside the phones you know

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,030
that's how the the negative nature work

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,470
they didn't want to rack up too much of

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:44,390
our data shock that happens a lot so

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,730
that's one part of the story but there's

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,860
a learned expectation that we all use

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:52,370
our mobile for beta activities like we

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,950
we engage of every customer or every

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,930
company through a mobile phone that

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,390
expectation is carried over when you

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,670
walk in the coolship as well so we as a

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,550
company had to provide a digital

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,740
experience for the customer then in turn

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,920
invest on that so that will get a lot

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,870
more data we didn't have much data and

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,090
they're like multiple reasons for doing

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,360
this as well a lot of the process were

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:19,010
very manual still our manual but say you

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
need that I said earlier you need to

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,850
look us for a break first

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,640
you need to fill out a form and then you

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,930
leave it out in the in the door hang

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,130
outside there'll be people walking

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,880
around the ship they're called the

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:35,720
runners who pick these cards 400 final

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,370
of them manually sorted before that

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,940
happens the last one happens around 3:00

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,210
in the morning

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,270
so you could order that and then they

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,980
manually and exalted by different times

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,290
different backs and then prepare

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,190
everything and start delivering by 6:00

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,810
in the morning

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:55,320
the moment we brought in a digital

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:58,920
platform and they saved 90 minutes of

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,430
process time which means that was among

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,290
15 people that's just one thing right so

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,010
we had a huge opportunity when we

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,810
started having little platforms on board

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,180
that the pain the challenges we faced

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,790
was the disconnected environment so we

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,880
had 16 and or 18 different cruise ships

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:21,120
each ship is its own data center so we

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,980
couldn't run once one site on the cloud

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,290
and source it to the ship because there

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,430
is no internet connection so each ship

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,750
had to run its own production

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:33,480
environment for that guest so we have 18

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,480
hour all the problems that we face is 18

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,970
times the problem so and to deploy to

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,760
the ship to give updates when in fact we

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,890
have a system now I am very glad that we

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,220
have system we release to the ships at

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,470
least twice a week and we also have

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,450
built automatic rollbacks or something

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,810
goes wrong it rolls back because is

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,760
remote maintenance is very difficult in

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,649
a ship environment so we had so much

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,800
challenges with that and Drupal played a

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:07,709
huge role because Drupal is the core CMS

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:10,410
providing data and then so overall I

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:13,170
think we have expanded Drupal is one

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,760
part but we do other application so

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,070
applications to to help this entire

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,070
process but we are on the wave of this

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,470
digital transformation so what we say is

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,810
we are trying to innovate on vacation

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,550
right to give a better experience for

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,850
the cab passenger getting more

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,850
personalized so that's all happening

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,709
another wave is happening from this

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,279
November where we are bringing in lot

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,480
more devices and machine learning

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,880
real-time decision-making on both the

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,820
ship is much more enhanced experience

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,350
this was showcased in CES in 2017

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,420
January and we are going to launch in

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,000
November it's pretty interesting you can

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,980
see it in YouTube it's a lot more

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,910
involved and Drupal is also playing a

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,620
key role there

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:06,230
I think I got a little lucky we weren't

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,120
trying to solve an emerging problem we

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,490
didn't have an emergency we didn't have

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,250
an existing site what we had was an idea

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:18,430
that if we could deliver high quality

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:22,160
video educational video and interactions

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:25,339
into the home in support of pre-op

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,320
post-op conditions then we'd be able to

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,350
help you know hospitals and insurers

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,560
help their customers what we had was the

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:36,590
need for the ability to rapidly publish

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:40,550
sites manage a multitude of brands and

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:43,610
sub brands need the ability to manage

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,550
content centrally and then publish out

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,830
to different end points we deliver the

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,520
experience over several set-top box

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:55,250
devices Smart TVs personal mobile phones

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,710
tablets as well as a responsive website

00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,690
and what we wanted to do is we want to

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,030
be able to create an environment that

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,290
was more self-service so through

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,970
leveraging site factory and content hub

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,740
by aqueon we were able to set up an

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,960
environment where you know relatively

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,490
quickly in a matter of you know a day or

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,890
two we can stand up a whole new instance

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,800
and I can connect that instance to

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,030
several other features as well as the

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,060
content itself and then deliver that

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,980
content you know anytime anywhere and

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,770
that's sort of the problem we're trying

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,430
to solve how could we create a an

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:34,430
environment where we could enable our

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,080
customers to be more self-service so

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,690
we've connected that to several other

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,820
you know interesting pieces we also

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,830
deliver what we call virtual interaction

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,790
which is really just a WebRTC based

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,010
virtual chat for groups so clinicians

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,860
and care managers connect with patients

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,020
in their homes or on the mobile devices

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,850
and again you know when we look at a

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,980
large insurer you know they have

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,380
multiple sub brands each needing both

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,470
localized content for the brand as well

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,270
as their own branding and using Drupal

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,840
in this way it allowed us to quickly

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,540
spin up and connect a lot of sites and

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,640
and manage information centrally and

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:20,230
add-on advised us to both on a lot of

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:23,920
capability we had a proprietary website

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:25,660
comm would not net website and we had a

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,790
need to get our conference registration

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,370
up and running and our developers were

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,590
in California three hours behind us and

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,060
we're unable to accommodate us and we

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,240
had a very short timeline

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,980
six weeks to get the conference

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,440
registration up and running so basically

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,770
we split out our e-commerce from a law

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,850
firm website because everything all the

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,380
credit cards were going to be run

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,880
through the same thing and we build a

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,920
registration website in Drupal used drop

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,650
boards labs to do all the work for us

00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,280
and it led into three additional

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,140
websites that we worked on with them to

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,810
address some of our other business

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,590
issues

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:10,690
so obviously you turned to Drupal as the

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,570
solution of choice if you could

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:17,800
summarize like what was the core reason

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:23,970
for using Drupal that's what they told

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:30,130
me to do you must have a great partner

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:32,380
alright for us we were actually in the

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,860
middle of an RFP so we would looked at a

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,070
couple other agencies smaller agencies

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,260
larger larger agencies and the team

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,370
miles was able to offer us a solution

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,650
that was really visually appealing that

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,990
allowed me the flexibility to go in and

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,030
do what I needed to do we were kind of

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,820
in a different situation I asked them to

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,220
build the template and then I went and

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,520
built out all the other pages we had a

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,230
really limited budget and if I asked if

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,510
I would have you know if I would have

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,850
had them do all the work it would have

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,590
been you know it would have been too

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,090
much for us to handle so they were very

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,210
flexible they helped me get up and

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,980
running and it just you know flexibility

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,080
security because that was the biggest

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,220
issue for us at the time having a secure

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,990
website

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,990
broadcasting spam all over the place so

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:34,340
one big thing will besides it being free

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:37,100
as our idea the biggest selling point

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,280
was when we actually showed a demo to

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,110
our internal stakeholders or our ten'll

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,180
users around how a content management

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,530
system could actually work and how they

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,780
could build out their pages and all that

00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,550
type of stuff and then it just drove

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,560
itself from there so once they saw it

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,240
and compared it to what they have they

00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:59,650
just rent yep we'll have one please

00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:01,730
we'll do that's pretty straightforward

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,310
you know it's funny I think we'd all say

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,110
you know I had limited time right I had

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,930
a limited budget but I guess all that's

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,540
really relative right probably not so

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,730
limited to some some other folks but the

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,400
dribble framework itself allowed us to

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,400
speed up development rapidly and it

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,140
allowed us again to be able to create

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,660
more of a self-service scenario in

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,340
multiple underlying sites much more

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,350
rapidly than having to roll any of that

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,530
stuff you know ourselves in the tech

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,850
team you know on top of that you know

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,890
I've been fortunate enough to be working

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,330
with Drupal now for nearly 10 years so

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,720
had a lot of experience with Drupal

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,670
itself made it a natural fit because the

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
rest of the the health platform itself

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,050
was loosely coupled technology pieces

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,000
through a pis

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,070
and so you know I have a video

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,620
management system that does transcoding

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,210
and storage and playback and you know I

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,640
feed data from that directly into Drupal

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,160
and then I feed the data out of triple -

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,520
via multiple other endpoints so it made

00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,280
it a very logical solution for us again

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,540
it was a it's a solid framework we have

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,300
a lot of role based and brand based

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,550
privileges or permissioning or

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,620
provisioning however you classify it so

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,760
again instead of having to you know

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,160
build all of that kind of capability

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,400
from the ground up we were able to

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,740
leverage a lot of what Drupal has in

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,930
in place today especially when we look

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,610
at you know we deliver you know video

00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,190
based content along with you know

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,930
assessments your watch this information

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,230
and answer these questions it allows us

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:39,910
to easily package content into

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,559
digestible chunks and aggregate those

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,120
chunks based on it you know metadata

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,520
that's associated with it or the content

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,170
that underlies it and again Drupal gives

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,270
a lot of flexibility in being able to do

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:55,600
that I mean don't let you do it all they

00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:00,100
said on top of it it's the speed to

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,470
market because what we use Drupal is not

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,400
just as a content management system it

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:08,800
essentially is driving three things for

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,990
us one is content of course multilingual

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,540
content that's another advantage on

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,340
Drupal how good multilingual is and it

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,740
can make it a little difficult but it

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,540
can be it can be done we currently

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,630
support nine languages onboard the ship

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,580
so to give that information for the

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,460
guests for that day in their native

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,140
language needed a lot of flexibility for

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,690
us to push the limit of our proprietary

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,630
CMS or any other application could do

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,610
and Drupal was able to do that helped us

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,840
do that so that's one thing that's free

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:43,410
to market second aspect that we do is

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,870
communication so when we had to create a

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,929
social network onboard the ship so that

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,910
the passengers could chat with their

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:56,950
fellow fellow beings like fellow friends

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,630
or roommates families so we had to

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,990
create something that could work in a

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,940
web web environment and Drupal even

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,760
though the CMS but had the community had

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,170
modules like private messaging so we

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,540
could start we could get a head start

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:13,330
and people have done similar things

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,950
using Drupal so we were using Drupal to

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,990
create that chatter still works that way

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,740
I'm not say that the best chat ever but

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:24,530
we got the job for us it it helped us

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,750
build that so enter translation for us

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:30,110
was done in two months on development

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,640
time the messaging was again done in two

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,790
to two and a half months development

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,560
time to integrate that so those are two

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,660
major sections where the continent

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,830
communication third thing came commerce

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,930
our initial goal was not to sell

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:48,580
services or anything to the passengers

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:51,770
but when it came to a situation where we

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,870
had 50% of passengers using our

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:58,850
application they were very comfortable

00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:01,760
with using our platform and the need

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,820
came to be for them to get more services

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,940
like booking shore excursions are

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,750
reserving kostik tables table for

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:15,350
restaurants are the room service

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,020
Drupal still had some solution that we

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,840
could start with and that that's the

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,850
flexibility that you know the speed that

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,890
we could deliver something I had Lena

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,650
the beta for the passenger test and

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,740
improve upon I think that's that's what

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,900
made grouper work for us

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,780
nice what really is amazing to me is

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,020
that this is one platform being used so

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,990
variety of ways you know very versatile

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,040
tool that you guys are using so few you

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,500
