Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Drupal 8 feels and look like Drupal 7 for the backenduser - Not the developer, that knows about all the REST, twig, cmi,  [insert more buzzwords here] awesomeness. Sadly this makes Drupal feel like its a dinasour from 2010 - and not the modern, fresh system for powering a web experience.

So What can we do about the presentation of Drupal 8. Can fancy design help us out to get rid of the smell of 2010 ?


Why do Drupal8 look like Drupal7 ??

Why is this very bad for the adobtion of Drupal.
The state of drupals admin experience.
Drupals lack of seperation of frontend & backend.
The wonders of Developer driven design.

Patterns  that became a truth "this is how we do it"
Tables - we Love tables they are made for data!
What if the Germans made the Design & the Italians made the Engine ?
Rethinking the design of the admin experience.

Dont reinvent everything.
Taking one step back, re think the experience for the user, not the developer.
What do we want to achive by this ?
a design language for a Drupal experience.

1em, 16px, 8pt - making simple rules for an advanced system.
Design first, implementation later.

This one goes to 11

The Eleven Design project.
Frontend Facing admin interface.
Backend facing admin interface.
eleven theme.
This talk is about showing  some the design problems that drupal over the years have inherited by beeing a developer driven project, and point to a way out of this, so we can make Drupal be pretty.
