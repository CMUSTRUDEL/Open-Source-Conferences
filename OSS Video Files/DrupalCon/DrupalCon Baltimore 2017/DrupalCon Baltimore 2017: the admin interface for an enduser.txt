Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: the admin interface for an enduser
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Drupal 8 feels and look like Drupal 7 for the backenduser - Not the developer, that knows about all the REST, twig, cmi,  [insert more buzzwords here] awesomeness. Sadly this makes Drupal feel like its a dinasour from 2010 - and not the modern, fresh system for powering a web experience.

So What can we do about the presentation of Drupal 8. Can fancy design help us out to get rid of the smell of 2010 ?


Why do Drupal8 look like Drupal7 ??

Why is this very bad for the adobtion of Drupal.
The state of drupals admin experience.
Drupals lack of seperation of frontend & backend.
The wonders of Developer driven design.

Patterns  that became a truth "this is how we do it"
Tables - we Love tables they are made for data!
What if the Germans made the Design & the Italians made the Engine ?
Rethinking the design of the admin experience.

Dont reinvent everything.
Taking one step back, re think the experience for the user, not the developer.
What do we want to achive by this ?
a design language for a Drupal experience.

1em, 16px, 8pt - making simple rules for an advanced system.
Design first, implementation later.

This one goes to 11

The Eleven Design project.
Frontend Facing admin interface.
Backend facing admin interface.
eleven theme.
This talk is about showing  some the design problems that drupal over the years have inherited by beeing a developer driven project, and point to a way out of this, so we can make Drupal be pretty.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
right it's uh it's 5 o'clock now and I

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,460
guess that I'm the last thing standing

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,730
between you guys and your world to serve

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,889
drink today so I better get this started

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,740
by the way and I have a tendency to go

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,910
for 60 minutes anyway so but I'll see if

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,340
I can make it a little bit shorter for

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,090
once but let's figure that so welcome to

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,710
my session here do Becan around admin

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,060
admin based theme so the admin

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,670
experience for normal people

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,369
you know the non developers we've been

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,300
looking into a little little while so

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:35,399
first of all you can just use the write

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,559
bigger instead one hmm yes so my name is

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,059
Morton also known as modern birch or

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,270
modern decay in this community was also

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,360
my my twitter handle actually I'm the

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,700
one who asked the business card it says

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,850
badass so if you do not know that that's

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,629
how it is I do want to shop called theme

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,859
machine it is themed machine not the me

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,050
machine which I've seen people yesterday

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,539
completely ripping my theme machine out

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,090
and now just taking the piss on me um

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,400
apparently because I stopped ranting

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,600
about this which I'm not going to talk

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,430
about today I'm not going to mention

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,750
anything around markup anything else

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,180
which have been doing for the last 10

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,850
years which also means that material is

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,830
new today but first of all just

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,869
previously I love to will very much

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,150
actually last you was so much that I've

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,430
named my my two biceps at the too

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,840
popular to both distributions lightning

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,939
and thunder so but today what I'm going

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
to talk about first like the whole like

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,890
Google history of what I called

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,450
developer driven design and so what is

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,490
developed rivet design well first of all

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,290
the first time I talked about design in

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,240
the world Drupal is almost 10 years ago

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,100
I did a bath at Cooper come in Boston

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,229
and the first thing that happened there

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,850
was Sam I came into the room and there's

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,490
two other people sitting there and they

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,899
talked about that young Google and

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,380
design yeah I've got a big database

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,850
design so B is a designer stay in there

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,960
talking icons and stuff they want to

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,320
talk about how we design the best

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,329
databases like holy crap we're far far

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,580
far from home in this world but that has

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,110
changed over the years and but Google

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,209
have always been very good at being a

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,590
developer driven design system as we see

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,099
here at the very first

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,989
version of Drupal almost 17 years ago

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:21,150
those of us who've never to open one can

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,849
see here some patterns that we all know

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,530
from from from from data on Drupal we

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,620
have no an account we have the block

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,660
block Annette box known Claire on the

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,660
comment and so forth we also have be

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,000
very useful to will blue blue as a link

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,200
tall is always a good thing and there

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,430
was actually a theme already at this

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,830
point and there's actually one thing

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,890
that you need to see here that is it is

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,959
modern and so already at this point we

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,780
are using the word modern as a thing

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,170
that we do if we go further down here we

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,239
see the use of tables a little bit of

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,299
spacing as it should be back in the days

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,730
it goes up a to before as well doing the

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,680
same thing and then at some point we get

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,599
to do with 4.7 and that's when your

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,069
Blumarine comes in but it still keeps

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,870
the same like design patterns you know

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,930
use a table because it's data and that's

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,140
what going to do in the same way how we

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,030
modify and have all of lists its form

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,880
fields it blocks its elements it's

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,370
always in the table that goes further

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,920
down as you come into a little bit too

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,560
fast year into garland as well as came

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,769
back and googled five and and Drupal 6

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,180
which was basically the admin theme at

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,150
that point there's no real difference

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,819
between having an SMT monolith we must

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,519
collect all solve together which is kind

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,799
of still this and then we come up to

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,549
this error of seven which is basically

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,889
from back in 2009 and up until now which

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,480
we all know so what I did here was

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,730
actually I took a bunch of screenshot

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,069
this is Google seven and this is two

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,660
blade as you can see this though a lot

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,569
of things happened over these seven

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,299
years of our admin themes or as the

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,549
structure here says you see those of

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,010
those have changed I really have a new

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,930
product in Drupal 8 we used what seven

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,639
years of our life to pushing through I

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,980
used four years of my life in the issue

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,470
through trying to get quicken and it

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,799
still looks the same if she content

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,750
types

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,459
changed a little bit they've got to drop

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,389
down or drop links and so forth the

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,719
themes as well

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,729
it's the same thing it's pretty much the

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,150
same theme that we build up it changed a

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,370
little

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,960
it but it's kind of if you have to go

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,160
all the way down to it so come here

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,449
here's my favorite part by the way of

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,830
two Commission's right this is like one

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,820
of the one of the good things as well

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,110
that we try to work a lot with the base

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,789
is actually kind of complicated because

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,740
there's a lot of data in there but again

00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,850
it's a table because everything into one

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,830
needs to be a table because we're

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,840
developers so of course we do a table

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,100
the biggest things biggest change I've

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,139
seen over these seven years actually

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,660
came into to blue eight point three

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,639
which is the state of states this is how

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,729
the state is paced you to look and now

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,580
it looks like this way to me I do enjoy

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,280
a lot but basically the only things that

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,070
we changed from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 a

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,690
so the admin menu as you can see the

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,900
color little bit of icons change a

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:23,970
little bit you know there's more white

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:29,789
space it's a good thing tabs change

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:34,889
position if it became responsive at

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:36,810
least so I'm like sitting in look at

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,550
this and and I got a little bit cranky

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,560
I saw one tweeted out like now I'm going

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,599
to and know about like everything

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,979
that's wrong in Google actually not I

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,659
was just like more looking at it from

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,550
from the perspective of know how to

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,169
design trench works because it's kind of

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,300
designs when when Google's when seven

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,370
came into Google seven we're all so

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,530
excited by and now they come a little

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,320
bit set and there's a reason for that

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,659
you know anything that's that was new at

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,789
some point it's gonna be okay it's gonna

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,349
go to this place is so so this is kind

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,479
of like I was looking at different

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:09,090
fashion elements this is basically me

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,550
you and our site 19 years old like Doc

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,020
Martens flannel shirt metallic like the

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,740
Lightning shirt I just bought a new one

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,650
actually two days ago yes that was a

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,280
good year 1984 you know and chair of

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,320
jeans so if you go back to 1992 you have

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,610
hill bands looking like that that was

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,159
how we were looking at that point and

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,380
then I was looking at men's fashion did

00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,380
a quick google certain you have the same

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,630
thing so we just have to wait you know

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,789
20 years and then seven is going to be

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,020
like the new hot thing I'm not saying

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,819
that seven is you know

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,710
it's bad design that's not what I'm

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,620
saying I'm just saying it you know just

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,889
as us who's 43 years old at some point

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,659
you know we used a lot who look like

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,979
getting a little bit to add so at some

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:55,770
point you elected next decade

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,449
it's probably going to be hard again but

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,139
I do think it's about time we begin to

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,759
look into rethinking these things

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,310
because if the difference between Drupal

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,169
8 and 207 is basically nothing you know

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,400
why would you then go out and you know

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:14,090
update it here we go why would you go

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,259
out and use a ton of money on a thing

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,000
where it's not really changing anything

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,840
because basically with with base till

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,310
then as a record as an album see I'm

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,289
that all I'm talking about ray Carter

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,819
found these two wonderful pictures but

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,770
if you want to go out and sell something

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,050
you just need to accept that you get

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,430
hope you get just by how it looks and I

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,530
do think it's a little bit sad that here

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,800
now Google world we've used those six

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,960
seven eight years of building a new

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,039
system and we can talk old all the

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,530
wonders about like configuration

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,509
management I can talk days and everybody

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,449
who knows me knows I can talk days about

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:51,569
quake and the wonders of that and but

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,340
nobody besides us who knows it can see

00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,930
it because anybody who's going to come

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,099
in and use if you were seven site versus

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,590
two blades is going to see the same

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,810
thing so how we even going to go to fill

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,940
are going to go into your boss at your

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,159
company and be like hey so I want to

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,610
upgrade my site to do blade look how

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,430
awesome it looks and then you show them

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,870
the 70 which is the same they had in 207

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,340
so why would they upgrade when they

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,279
cannot see that so I mean so it's kind

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,080
of like no 17 years of developer

00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,520
treatment design or let me do it like

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,169
this so this developers in the room you

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,240
can actually understand what it what it

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,169
does because I know when I use like call

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,839
us and do things like this it goes into

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,370
panic mode okay this is goes custom in

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,320
the world of Google is that code is

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,539
goals and you know designers it's a

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,950
pretty thing but it's an afterthought

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,300
it's always an afterthought it's not

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,919
like you come into the Google one blog

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,680
ear I'm a designer and you like

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,870
listening look here you war it's more

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,820
like I'm a designer and yet what can you

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,620
walk over in that corner and then paint

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,610
within the like the little blocks we

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,740
have made for you you can get

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,410
like red blue and green and just make it

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,170
pretty and it's kind of turning into

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,029
this mess so I've been thinking a bit

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,709
like why did we end up in this how come

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,140
did we end up in this kind of mess so if

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:10,560
I go back like 11 years this is my first

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:14,459
cubic on eleven years ago we're just a

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,660
bunch of nerds basically and we're never

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,149
thinking about like who the audience

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,980
were we just want to build a system a

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,630
system where we could pop us our website

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,610
and be done with it we never thought

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,680
about the audience I mean normally when

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,019
I think about my audience it's like this

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,399
dude they were standing behind me and

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,140
explained to me I can move to the left

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,899
you move to like to move to that little

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,870
bit little just a niche just a nudge how

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,300
big is that not I still don't know but

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,579
I've moved a lot of websites about that

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,440
way and the problem we have with this

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,740
method like it's undefined you know is

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,140
Google a tool is it's an aside are we

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,209
building websites of building a data

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,430
structure something something who's the

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,470
who's the user who's actually using the

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,180
admin interface is it you as a developer

00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,130
who's building all these things or is it

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,529
that site it'll put the data in and

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,420
we're trying to put everything in to one

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,300
big box and we trying to force everybody

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,279
into the same thing which if you work in

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,690
any level of design know how hard it is

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,959
it's kind of like somebody says well I

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:17,399
need a new logo that's that's modern but

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,120
timeless okay what when that doesn't

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,680
make sense right

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,510
it's like markup how many how many

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,449
designers in here have worked on a

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,820
modern but timeless design that's at

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,920
least three of you I am not the only one

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,260
to share this pain so I look at Google

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,540
as this Google is Jewish used to build

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,130
web things that's what it does actually

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,199
a couple of years ago Waller came up

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,810
with to try to figure out why I did not

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:41,550
fit into this Drupal like definition of

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,050
Google developer I came up with this

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,779
thing that Google is built by engineers

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,970
for developers that's basically what it

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,649
is it's a bunch of nerds

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,750
hammering around trying to build

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,720
something that they think are really

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,490
really cool and then we give it

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,980
to that into you so we don't really know

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,589
so what if we made Drupal instead after

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,209
something that's made by geeks or people

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,160
begin to think that way instead you

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,899
don't think about you as the target or

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,440
don't you think about that person who's

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,870
going to do

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,360
then Google turns into become another

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,519
thing it's like building this for people

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,949
not for ourselves anymore which I know

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,500
as a developer makes me scared

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,170
because they tell you they don't even

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,069
know how much a nudge is they just want

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,750
things and I just want to build my stuff

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:29,310
over in this corner but that's not why

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,589
we build touble we building Google

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,790
ragazzo we wanted to kill the developer

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,350
I want to kill the decide I want to kill

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,170
all these people so normal people could

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,970
build websites that should be the goal

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,579
so instead of just moaning about it how

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,100
could we fix it well this different ways

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,050
of fixing it this of course the trash it

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,120
all that's been like a good thing you

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,730
know just you want a complete checklist

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,649
murdery like rip everything out go as

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,199
much at this as we can drop everything

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:58,319
we've done and start all over you know

00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:59,490
kind of what no checks made here a

00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,170
couple of years ago when they were like

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,790
80 percent done with takes may 2 and

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,889
they skipped all the production because

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,209
they want to make it perfect how many

00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:13,680
here use takes place today markaba it's

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:16,170
still there you use it sometimes it's

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,240
like but no five years ago everybody's

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,120
using checks made even better you know

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,949
this logo yeah Netscape right Netscape

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,180
came out with Netscape 6 and I was like

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,529
year we're going to rebuild the whole

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,300
platform is going to be this amazing

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,949
thing and we're starting this small

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,829
project over here on the side called

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,089
Firefox well fast forward they were

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,009
building and building and building and

00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:39,060
building a building and nobody used it

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,069
and so my opinion what we should try to

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,230
do instead of going like checklist mode

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:46,230
actually the look is like how can we fix

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,420
it I'll fix it in contribute a sit in

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,480
call because anybody who's been into any

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,639
call uses call call issues and trying to

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,889
fix things inside a tuple call knows

00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,269
that that's going to be a never-ending

00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,130
discussion where it's going to be really

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,600
really hard to get anything done there's

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,279
a reason that I'm doing so much here

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,079
it's not because I'm getting old there's

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,819
a reason that I have gray here now it's

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,500
because of the issue queues and

00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,750
having to discuss everything with

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,069
everybody you know if that's one person

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,259
the room of things like you know what

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:15,120
hey I don't like that great they will

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,800
then stop the issue for coming in and

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
then we have to discuss color theory

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,189
once again you don't have to have any

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,850
kind of degree instant they'll decide on

00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,740
anything else you

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,980
just stop it because you don't feel like

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,690
it and so if we instead of trying to

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,000
push all this into tubule call by the

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,430
way do that in country instead then we

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,160
can actually get stuff done that leaves

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,839
my theory about ISM I might be wrong

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,259
happened before that I was wrong once or

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,470
twice

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,000
anyways so I was like taking a step back

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,069
and looking at the theme space what to

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,290
be doing the themes in trouble how does

00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:50,819
it work well basically your site has

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,529
three oh thank you there we go

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,949
basically you have three three themes

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,220
say that really fast herbs are three

00:13:54,949 --> 00:14:00,839
three themes

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,430
anyways we have three themes in every

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,319
Google site and go back

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,449
nope I have seven and my front end theme

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,519
that is not true my friends you have

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,709
three different one you have the thing

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,050
you use for your Google admin thing

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:17,040
right now bunch of use public on I use

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:20,100
seven then you have your group of

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,279
contents which is show

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,870
goddamnit this clicker is not working

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
right then you have your normal

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,269
front-end and then you have what I told

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,720
front-end admin tools you fart Jesus

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,220
Christ days I epic shows we have the

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,319
heckling roller if you want to hear go

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,759
me you need to sit over down here so I

00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,759
can actually throw water at you later on

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,470
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo well now I'm talking

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,630
about the front-end tools let's call

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,850
them front-end themes instead though so

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,360
the idea block for the front-end little

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,860
admin to also themes as you can see I've

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,810
not really figured out the names yet I'm

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,579
not calling it if eighty because that

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,899
would be fat and then you know somebody

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,670
might thinking something something

00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,959
that's not the point of it but the idea

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,389
is that we have three different themes

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,990
in your site so what is front-end admin

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,970
tools well that is your tool bar it is

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,459
there when you are developing your site

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,920
it goes over your at your normal

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,779
front-end and theme and it's using

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,880
something from somewhere and Google it's

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,290
actually using through koi lemons that's

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,120
where it comes with right now that's the

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,069
same as seven but that's not the same

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,540
thing at this it's the same theme you

00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,649
can actually overwrite these elements

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,529
the same thing with like the inline

00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,180
editing it's the same thing or

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,950
contextual links or the outside in

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,080
element

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,270
all of these things are different

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,870
funding tools and they are all like

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,490
inheriting from different places that's

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,310
just this is just how it added in is

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,860
that important so so all of these like

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,330
different funding airplane tools can by

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,400
separating these two different things

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,170
out you can then begin to focus on how

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,790
should my admin experience actually be

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,980
how should that look how should my

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,800
front-end site look as on a normal level

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,660
and then how does my tools when I'm

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,340
locked in as an editor and have access

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,110
to these elements how do they actually

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,580
interact because the whole idea of

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,040
saying well I'm not going to keep my end

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,660
users any reason to use that that's kind

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,650
of like saying well so you're not going

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,750
to give your end user

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,360
inline editing but you know all the

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,250
other systems is giving their uses so I

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,210
wouldn't use all these elements we need

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,730
to like rethink that and package it in

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:28,010
so with with those different kind of

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,440
things that that conceptual thinking I

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,840
started out by saying or I have I did

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,820
one FM team like last year and said okay

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,150
how do calculate change this so how can

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,760
we fix this issue so I came up with this

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,530
thing called 11 a theme that's not

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,680
designed for developers but actually

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,840
designed for more of the normal user so

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,220
it's actually with the idea of trying to

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,840
make stuff pretty and so kill the tables

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,490
and actually a funny story from

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,950
yesterday when I demoed this the first

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,460
time for anybody outside of pretty much

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,900
my own apartment because building

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,780
building layouts building design ideas

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,550
building concepts out is really really

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,530
hard if you only show snippet up to

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,480
people and can be really hire designers

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,459
get kind of sensible about their designs

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,990
so but when I showed this off the first

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,390
time the first comment I got from one of

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:21,410
the developers like but what if I want

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,120
the table just like yes exactly but I

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,130
have a solution for that so no no worry

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,600
about that so so this just visit the

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,310
very first like public showing of my

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,800
admin team 11 the idea here is like that

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:37,220
instead of having a table of data you

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,470
have a bunch of cards instead of so as

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,900
you you move around this side it's got

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,090
the separate elements having an icon on

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,220
them having call us on them having this

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,270
concept of it is these this used to be

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,550
tables it

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,780
not anymore completely rewritten same

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,260
thing when you go into your content

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,880
types

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,310
why are the content I put in our table

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,730
if you browse around that that doesn't

00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,900
look pretty

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,720
um no should we actually have like the

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,330
all the links visible from the get-go as

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,460
well same thing when you comment to

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,410
manage fields all these fields are now

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,180
just elements in the table which makes

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,510
things feel and look very very technical

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,160
and to put them into a card instead

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,860
which is basically a card means it's a

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,930
box that has like a specific or an image

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,180
and a title and some politic if we try

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,920
to think it this way instead then sudden

00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,660
you get away from the table look you get

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,550
away from the technical like like

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,060
interface and try to make it more human

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,920
and of course me and my life I hunt I

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,390
color graphically it makes it really

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,310
really fun to like adding these little

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,280
icons and find them that takes only

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,170
forever and ever the same thing as when

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,670
you go up and actually say well every

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,440
element that you have in this drupal

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,180
system why should the whole text why

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,640
don't we have little icons on them make

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,310
them fit why are we always limiting

00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,230
ourselves to these like well what can we

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,060
kind of agree upon what is the lowest

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,330
level to agree upon why don't we try to

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,950
push these things around and the second

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,680
thing I like so so the displace and a

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,050
potatoes tries like we think them know

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,150
even even though how juice is listed

00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,850
that wives views lifted out as a table

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,890
again it's an element that we built just

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,600
to show you about this is actually

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,580
working I'm not doing a live demo

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,410
because doing live demos means that my

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,830
machine will crash instantly and I will

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,740
bring down so this is views and how I'm

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,870
the secatur views actually looks as you

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,040
see it it still works it's just changing

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,010
a little bit of the math of changed a

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,750
little bit of the CSS changing quite a

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,790
lot of JavaScript elements around to

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,850
figuring out where stuff come from views

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,920
UI is the biggest beast I've ever tried

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,990
to wrestle with and the amount of times

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,320
I lost and I was like no it I'm not

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,060
going to do this and and I begin to use

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,620
the arguments as a well you know an

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,470
inducer is not going to use views

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,750
because why would you and then I began

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,710
to think about I've been attractive to

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,679
use having normal people inside of my

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,510
not nerds so having my my girlfriend and

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,580
her daughter there and my daughter as

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,559
well trying to talk like web design with

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:11,480
them and you know what they don't care

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,830
about Drupal at all not one bit so I

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,080
don't begin to like explain all these

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,360
technical difficulties like how it's

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,220
good like well it's not pretty

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,440
is it is it easy to use does it look

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,149
good can I use this for my phone and I'm

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,669
sitting there with my laptop and like

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,409
trying to explain the epicness of how I

00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,480
made an icon move around on the screen

00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,370
and all these things and you know normal

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,840
users don't care about they don't care

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,429
about it it's Drupal or not take care

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,620
but if it works they care if it looks

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:37,909
good in the case it feels good and we

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,470
are going around this conference like

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:42,409
high-fiving each other over how epic

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,289
Drupal is but as soon as you go out of

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:50,539
this room they don't care at all not one

00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:53,529
bit so I mean the idea of if an end user

00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:55,340
like no that's a mile I know epic

00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:56,330
somebody's never worked with you would

00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,299
never work with anything in these

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,620
actually I've a begin to play around the

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,390
admin interface and we then kind of say

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,520
to them all no you're not allowed to go

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,130
one play with views because that's too

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,080
big too dangerous for you like no come

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,260
on we need to like rethink and rebuild

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,690
these elements all the time which also

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,789
means that you know even views needs

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,870
like thinking how can you make views

00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,950
prettier how can you make these you know

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,929
these different elements will work

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,200
better and this is like a this is very

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,299
well and it kinda kind of works but the

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,789
idea aside to begin to look at this as

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,990
how would a non-technical person work

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,549
with this stuff how could you make it

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,890
easier for them to work but instead of

00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,929
us always going and finding an excuse

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,610
why we would not let them work with it

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:42,500
or you should not work with you because

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,029
that's way too advanced for you we

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,279
should not let them give them access to

00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:48,409
the user access because that's way too

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,390
advanced them or what if they just

00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:51,860
download the Drupal and built the

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,510
website on it and really don't care

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,990
about what we feel that they should use

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,220
is more I mean is it in my role as a as

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,419
anybody to say somebody should not use

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,880
Drupal in a certain way

00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,950
I thought you ghouls built for people to

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,730
build websites not for us as mayor to be

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,190
like no you should not use this or that

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,420
no I did leave one table in this system

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,660
still and that's the content

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,600
table which is still because I'm so much

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,480
caught up in the idea of data being a

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,480
table why is the preview of all all the

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,360
content here a list of data I mean with

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,460
the content type on who cares besides of

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,380
the developers of what kinds of type an

00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,180
element is I mean I don't we have this

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,390
shown in ways that would make sense

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,650
instead like make it a preview of the

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,110
data instead anyways

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,490
same thing with file so maybe they'll be

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,830
an idea tracked you have previews here

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,170
and so like all of these are the eg I've

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,900
only like scratch the surface here how

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,640
do we think if we can to rethink how

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,040
we're building this and thinking this is

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,290
a non-technical user coming in and

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,540
wanted to administrating the triple size

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,280
you can see how many things that we like

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,970
we're stopping them using it they would

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,470
become scared I went of course a little

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,210
bit further because what I was done with

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,790
this I was ok let's let's pick a pocket

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,110
how could the themes look what if what

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,200
it seems actually look in a different

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:14,240
way wise i steams just this long long

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,320
list of data why are we putting so much

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,820
stuff up there lies

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,420
why don't we have like little again

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,160
didn't I Sai cons or you know a little

00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,560
hardwood you said something as default

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,450
to these slight little things it's

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,090
things that makes people like happy and

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,860
yes I know that maybe blue moving

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,110
sneaked in there there's another reason

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,240
for that anyways later on the same thing

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,010
now we come into the place which I know

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,740
is that I make like people freak out you

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:42,110
know the modules page the way we install

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,420
a module today or no we don't install it

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:48,050
we enable and disable or whatever it's

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:51,290
called I don't know um anyways so here's

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,640
the modules page and what are we going

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,280
to play around was like why don't each

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,160
module half an icon have a visual

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,170
element that tells me this is Hill this

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,120
is this is action this is this is the

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,640
band module this is big pipe this is

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,380
this has an identity as a graphical

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,600
identity and each element had that

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,910
wouldn't that be way cooler wouldn't

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,710
that be epic if it did that same thing

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,900
here's like when an element is not if

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,150
I'm not able to show why do we put all

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,370
this data out one of the times like put

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,260
it into little cards make it human and

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,210
nice to look at I mean it's back to like

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,600
the apples this time thinking where they

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,789
went like wall-e Oh

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,580
everything has to be huggable why isn't

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,649
it like that why do we have like a

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,940
install and we have a and then we

00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,980
currently been clicking in more because

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,340
of this deform items it doesn't make

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,759
sense

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,350
um so as you can see here my machine

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,120
this machine is getting very very very

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,649
old by the way I'm getting a little bit

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,289
tired or to heat development on is not

00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:49,889
so good but still it's coming there

00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:51,779
hurry anyway so by beginning to think

00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:54,240
these things instead of they'll being

00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,190
dragged off in our our concept and our

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,600
ideas like everything is data tables and

00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,730
we're developers and we're just rolling

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,879
for developers I'm beginning to look at

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,649
all these interfaces as things I should

00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:06,840
play with and I should design and I

00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:09,509
should put colors on our to put identity

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,429
on because when I do that I I make it to

00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:14,879
a thing that's not a technical element

00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:16,500
it it's a tool that we use to build

00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,480
website and that experience should be

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,809
just as good as the website you're

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,799
building it shouldn't be hidden away

00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,080
another thing I began to play around

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,090
with like no configurations again why is

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,919
this tables it should not be tables like

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,940
what if what if he's part of a

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,129
configuration has its own little icon

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,210
own little element had maybe even has

00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:38,100
its own color

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,539
there's always symbolized with so when

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,340
you're navigating through the site and

00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,169
yes I know that well what if you're

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,740
colorblind and what if what if what if

00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:48,990
what if all these what ifs but what if

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,389
we try to stop ourselves constantly from

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,740
wanting to rebuild things because we

00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:55,889
have played with doing something wrong

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,870
and just like hey why don't we just do

00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:00,509
this stuff I mean as well as the

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,909
permission page um so when I did this

00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:04,289
this is the permission pages let me just

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,059
show you how it actually look now I

00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:07,679
thought about no permissions is a

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,590
there's a pain in the ass today to look

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,120
at what if we read begin to be saying

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,669
this and I put a screenshot out of this

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,600
on Twitter about two three months ago

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,370
and the first feedback I got was like no

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,860
all right why what are you saying no to

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,539
well I don't like that because I'm a

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,460
developer I need all my data to come

00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:29,279
fast and build this doesn't network what

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,899
but it's it's not for you it's for those

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,700
people who's not doing development this

00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:34,889
those who's not writing the C code

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,370
viruses for those people's just want to

00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:37,350
build it

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,470
what if we begin to rethink these

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,840
interfaces in

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,150
anways what are these these buttons you

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,150
can click down here actually show this

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,710
status of what's going on instead and

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,470
which by the way I also sent out a tweet

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,409
with a screen of that which had a little

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,630
locked icon on the person on and people

00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:58,750
went apeshit because I like checkboxes

00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,309
alright well that's all good but that

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,830
does not stop ourselves just because

00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:05,340
somebody says no this tries like built

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:08,020
these things around a lot of this is a

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,520
CSS detail so it's like what the element

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,169
I'm trying to build up around here oh

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,490
you have like tons of little elements

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:23,169
that I actually would make sense oops I

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:25,110
see was this demo about there we go yes

00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:28,900
so as you can see up if you look at the

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,000
little elements so here is like it's

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,830
trying to like do a little bit of very

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,390
small animations trying to play around

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,659
with that trying to figure out how could

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:40,059
we how can i maybe actually elevate what

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:41,919
we could do right now just with CSS what

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,020
if we like try to do these things I know

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,730
this much and I'm not work on somebody's

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,440
browser or boo-hoo-hoo

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,020
well actually this team was not working

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,730
with any icons on Firefox about till

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,070
last Thursday when they finally got HP

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,350
gmasks in and I was actually about like

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,590
 I need to rewrite every goddamn

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,669
page here to actually support Firefox

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,789
and then I was like you know what

00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,559
nope Firefox you I'm checking awake till

00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,909
you're going to catch up because this is

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,710
my little project right so I can do

00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,020
whatever I want I think or like but also

00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,820
requirements my browser climbers you're

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,710
going to use the latest gig as well as

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,299
you can find I'm sorry for that I'm

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,059
gonna use CSS variables because I don't

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,370
want to mess around with sass did you

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:23,230
say that yes I don't want to measure it

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,940
says I love CSS for help us and I know

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,039
there's reason to you said I know all

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,830
these things but this project is just

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,299
about getting stuff done um same thing

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,330
only begins like play around with mobile

00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:37,900
what I actually would love to do now is

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,520
see if this actually works yes what I

00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,090
would love to do was actually um maybe

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,970
change the position of where our are on

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,230
our menu is why is it I mean when you

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,899
use your phone like you have your phone

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,380
up in the hand like this and normally I

00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:55,870
then have something else in my hand

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,420
that's how it is why am I then you know

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm navigating my with my thumb wise

00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,280
wise my menu all the way up there why is

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,770
it up in the top well because that's how

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,500
we used to do it what if we placed it in

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,270
the bottom I know that again putting

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,920
that stuff out on Twitter well it

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,810
doesn't work in this browser that

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,340
browser whatever it is like well you

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,170
know it's not that we're saying that

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,030
this should go into Google : everybody

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,340
have to do it but let's try to rethink

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:24,340
these things let's use this space to try

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,290
to rebuild this things up and and just

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,460
to show you actually that my front-end

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,900
admin tools of themes I need I need help

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,250
with naming these things right as you

00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,230
can see I'm not the best thing as my I

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,060
need some people to do work working

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,870
marketing with me I'm to show that

00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,940
actually works though you have no this

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,760
is like custom themes built on top of of

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,480
Bartek same thing here with like the

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,960
outside-in

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,460
editing and you know editing up here as

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,110
well there's another design principle I

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,880
begin to what it was like how come we

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,430
always use blue what if we used another

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,410
color like pink streaming pimp

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,880
everything in assists and action what

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,340
have you try to think these ways is

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,050
there what what did we what if we didn't

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,870
have an admin theme those actually blue

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,460
I know that's like I was trying to

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,500
design something that was not blue and I

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,660
could not get my mind around it so I

00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,640
ended up just like socket first version

00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,760
just at the blue at some point is going

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,290
to change um at some point someday I

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,370
will also grow out of throughput am I

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,900
going to be people who don't want to

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,910
have a blue dream they might want to

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,860
have a green theme because their company

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,720
colors are Queen or what it could be

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,780
like this a million different ways of

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,760
thinking these things and and one of the

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,530
principles I came back whether they go

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,180
basically if you look at it as a data

00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,040
data it's always going to be a table but

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,430
then if I look at this on a card instead

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,420
it gives me other options I know that

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,310
designers and develops you looking at

00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,840
things very differently but this is not

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,280
built for developers it's built for

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,310
designers it's built for that for

00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,500
concept of where we could start it's

00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,870
built on there all these different ideas

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,310
around how a cart could look what is

00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,020
what is the way we're managing a field

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,000
is not even like with big-ass problems

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,010
but with small little buttons just with

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,030
icons that we would then recognize and I

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,920
know that some people then not be able

00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,200
use it but what about all the other

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,580
people who wanted to use it we try and

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,670
constantly actually stopping ourselves

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:16,430
from thinking around these boxes you

00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,680
know icons in colors so the way I built

00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,320
around the this 11 theme was basically

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,750
saying or let me start by defining also

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,910
a color plate not saying they should do

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,830
everything just a simple color plate so

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,680
I have no I have my different colors

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:32,630
based on though asphalt and concrete and

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,040
gravel and I have a blue style as you

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,140
need blue because we're in Drupal world

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,030
right I have that fairy and I have like

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,370
grass and strawberries and pumpkins

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,190
colors and even even yellow snow as a

00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,990
color which again is just my thumb sense

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,420
of humor which suddenly came in and now

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,920
is written in every she is fair ball on

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,750
his whole sitting like god damn it

00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,980
morning you're like why are you doing

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,770
this why are you calling it yellow snow

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,600
but then again it makes you laugh and

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,460
made me laugh every time I have to use

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,630
your like don't eat that yellow snow

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:04,220
um but doing these things then finding a

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,980
design language that we want to design

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,080
with the same thing here around type so

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,260
typography I'm always messing about

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,540
what's up Agra if it's an admin theme

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,250
let's then used whatever it's built in

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,290
let's make it closer to the element to

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,240
make it make it look like and maybe an

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,950
app someday when progressive web apps

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,560
comes for reals then we can just take

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,080
our stuff import it directly just mean

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,430
at least I didn't want to use those six

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,650
months to figure out what kind of funds

00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,330
I just want to like use the font that

00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,420
already built into my system also I

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,860
don't have to download that and the CSS

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,840
is pretty easy for that and if your

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,480
development goes completely into panic

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,730
mode here's the good thing you can still

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,590
just install Blumarine go back to the

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,170
good old day of four point seven and

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,060
nobody in the world is going to mess

00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,340
with you it's not like the morning

00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,800
precision of this sign is going to show

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,870
up and I knock on your door be like you

00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,760
need to use the 11th II know you can you

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,520
can actually just use Blumarine because

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,810
I mean I don't really care the only

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,310
thing I was sad about when I installed

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,340
through movie inverse I didn't get the

00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:11,990
create color I used to meet with such a

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:14,960
passion back in 4.7 so that was like a

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,370
really quick presentation of this I'm

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,070
trying to run it through fast because I

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,220
know that you guys like child

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,260
they and I do its last thing and they do

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,330
some crisis to stop I can show you more

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,040
like some of the files I do want to

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,670
thank out your fighter physical and

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,590
activation who pick me up about three

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,800
four months ago and actually just been

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,420
like funding my work here it actually

00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,970
saved hold bait show that that happened

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,490
doing you know normally venting but

00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,900
having at least one family to backing me

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,850
up in this world makes it possible for

00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,680
me it's hopefully to do this stuff but

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,200
you know I do really want to have some

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,940
help for it so if you want to play

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,280
around with this theme and I do need to

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,660
warn you all that as yesterday when I

00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,250
present it the first time and one

00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,340
developer took it down and he installed

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:03,010
it his first coming off well the error

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,170
message looks really pretty and it is

00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,630
really pretty because I found two

00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,570
different colors of raspberry I'm using

00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,610
for the a for the errors so I mean at

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,800
least the idea of baked it pretty

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,660
there's going to be a ton of box on this

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,040
of course there is because I mean I'm

00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,320
just hammering on stuff trying just to

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,360
get it all figured out and it's even

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,000
worse it's on github I have not even put

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,480
it over on Dido yet because I don't like

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,429
to do patches I really like o to just

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,179
work with this stuff I don't want to go

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:37,060
into technical levels so and then of

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,950
course there's the the usual pressing

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,140
again on this is is you know why did you

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,900
call it 11 and there's a there's a

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:50,700
simple reason for that and let's see if

00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:50,700
I can make this work why is it

00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:11,940
all right this is the this is the oldest

00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,319
oldest joke in any metal environment I'm

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,289
an old-school heavy metal fan so

00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:18,869
basically he he made this new his new

00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:20,700
amp and it goes to 11 he gets this

00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,589
question about why does it go to 11 I

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,529
doesn't just go to 10 why don't you just

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:29,880
make the chin higher like more loud I go

00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:33,599
up but it goes to 11 but but why well

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,190
it's one more and that's the whole

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,839
concept is that it's one more that's

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,799
trying to figure out how we can do that

00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:44,309
so here's a few links 11 theme is the

00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:45,269
hashtag I'm going to use for it if you

00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,930
want to play around with the github

00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:51,390
theme machine or the me machine / 11

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,039
getup theme machine 11 style guide

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,559
biggie is where I'm putting down this

00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,079
file guys I would love to get feedback

00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,670
and having especially designers coming

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
in and help out the technical

00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,749
implementations can be done at thousand

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,940
ways the whole content admin themes

00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:07,559
maybe we could put that into a module I

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,910
don't know yet I'm just trying to like

00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,170
see what kind of boundaries

00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:14,640
I can push if if you have crazy like

00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,109
what kind of icon sets I'm going to use

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,160
what at this point is going to be font

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:22,019
awesome and kiss font awesome is its GPL

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,130
feel we can release them data though

00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:28,769
people can use it and so forth so with

00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,559
that and I only spoke for 35 minutes so

00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,849
there's actually room for questions with

00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,920
that I would actually give you the

00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,829
chance to either come with some

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,210
questions or you can go out and get a

00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:41,969
piece of this sunny sunny lovely weather

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,259
we have here in Baltimore I'm so happy

00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,910
for the swimming pool I make sure that

00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:47,489
my girlfriend could swim in each day

00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:50,569
it's been wonderful to see the rain from

00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:53,700
our hotel windows it's good to nerd out

00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:56,940
so if there's any questions you could

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,739
use the mic there or I can like show off

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,869
a little bit more of the like other

00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:05,279
design principles are built in if you

00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:08,880
want to see that how much I paid for the

00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:10,650
icons well so so fun awesome

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,190
it just released a new version organs

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,280
about to release a new version and I

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,560
 ton of money for that which I put

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,680
in so it can actually get developed

00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,010
besides of that it's free because it's

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,390
GPL for you so that's good so if there's

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,040
no question I would like to like to show

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:31,150
off a little bit of the design concepts

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,700
if all people want to run run out so

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,819
there's I have a sketch file here which

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:43,990
have all the things in and if I could

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:55,329
like it my screen - oh god damn it

00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:57,910
Oh on screen hey what is please well

00:37:55,329 --> 00:38:04,930
it's got it when it's done when do you

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:06,369
think it's going to be done yeah it's

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,260
going to be done when it's done what now

00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:10,270
I hope to have a stable version out

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,829
within a couple of months I know the

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,770
guys at Pfizer I really want to use it

00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:18,339
fast quick so I need to like really push

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,540
up the speed a little bit on this so as

00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,369
you're one of those one of the funniest

00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,210
things that I begin to work around with

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:28,000
in this whole eleventeen thing was the

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,710
the concept of sizing funny enough it's

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,970
called eleven is built for Drupal eight

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,680
but I'm actually building everything

00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:37,720
around the idea of up stuff is being an

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,119
m1 m which is sixteen pixels so you can

00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,619
have something that's like and a half an

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,790
M which is like eight pixels and so

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,619
forth so everything is going to be

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,050
divided up in that but the good thing

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:49,180
about that is it makes it there really

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,520
really easy when we begin to like wanted

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,430
to this sign elements and how should

00:38:51,520 --> 00:39:04,720
they how should stuff let me just see

00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:06,550
here this is where we can see that so by

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,490
saying that everything has this size up

00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:11,170
one size is 16 pixels or 8 pixels and we

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,420
stop talking in pixels and talking this

00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,280
one or half a one and a half and two and

00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,540
a half or three or four one five also

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,310
makes everything actually aligned

00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,410
correctly same thing with all the

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,109
typography as well it's going to be 16

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,320
pixels or 24 pixels or 32 pixels but it

00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:28,190
always goes back to

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,620
being 1m or actually won them because I

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,550
like to more use films instead of em

00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,940
because then I don't get confused

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:41,410
anyways I'm not that clever I'm pretty

00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:44,000
but I'm not clever it's Jesus

00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:46,070
anyways so as you can see everything is

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,750
always taught in this idea of being like

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,460
this is like all checkboxes going to be

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,750
one and a half instead of one because I

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,060
want to happen big I wanna have big

00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:58,400
checkboxes the same thing if you go and

00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:01,300
let's say he'll the labels the checkbox

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,980
is the same concept

00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,080
everything here is divided up five

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,090
sixteen in some way so that just makes

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,230
it easy for us to pick up where do you

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,120
want to put stuff what do you want to

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,150
play to that so that's how that works

00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:19,400
out and we see this more fancy stuff I

00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:20,600
can show a different same thing with

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,910
different concepts or how we actually

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,940
want to install elements what if what if

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:28,760
it had so these kind of icons instead of

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,960
having things like begin to rethink we

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,460
play with these things figured out how

00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,460
to make it more doable how could make it

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,830
better because if there's one thing I've

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,690
learned over these years like well it's

00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,910
only ask developers also who's using

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,390
these laptops so we need to rethink

00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,710
these elements in so many ways and maybe

00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,930
we actually getting obsolete with our

00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,490
laptops even worse so stuff needs to be

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,030
bigger because needs to go into our

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,490
phones and so forth um see what else I

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:59,090
do have here start simple space drugs a

00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:03,020
heavenly ass yeah so basically these are

00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:06,410
the the key concepts of the system the

00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,840
same thing here if you look at my menu

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,070
here if you have anything this is just

00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,660
like conceptual ideas if you have

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,130
anything that requires an action like

00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,980
this detects what we want to focus on

00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,990
well then you know it's going to use my

00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,770
strong signal color which is my

00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:23,840
screaming pinky or uncharged like break

00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,510
away from these like standard elements

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,310
same thing everything needs everything

00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,710
needs to basically have some develop an

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,050
icon on it because if it's if it has an

00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,570
icon if it's not only the words on it

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,480
but adding the little icons it takes a

00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,579
ton of time I know but that do make

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,619
the system way more appealing to look at

00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:44,230
and that's basically concept of this

00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,849
make Google pretty first contact was

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,440
like change everything in rebuilding few

00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,030
things but at the end of the day is like

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,680
how do I make it pretty because I'm not

00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,240
expecting be able to from the theme

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,220
perspective to rebuild everything I'm

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,520
expecting to at least make it prettier

00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,380
and make this a stepping stone so if if

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,420
anybody want to come and help out you

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,089
know I would I would love to hear about

00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,829
it I have a bunch of of cars up here for

00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:08,650
my little shop you can ping me and talk

00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:10,150
with me about this the way this is going

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,450
to be built because it's out in

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:15,160
contributing to be like hey I have a I

00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,540
have some ideas some concepts I want to

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,570
go you have scenes on them if you like

00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:23,829
it fine if you really really hate them

00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,480
you know you can always go on you see if

00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:27,010
I can find that slide you can go up and

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,450
get help and just clone it and build

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,089
whatever you want with it and that's the

00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,560
idea I start to build these things but

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:34,180
not build them in the idea of like want

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,400
to change everything in Google I just

00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,380
want to build an admin design an admin

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,290
theme that makes me happy when I use

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,450
duple and that's the plan of it so with

00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:47,950
those words and if there's no questions

00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:49,900
at all yes just go up take the mic yeah

00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:54,220
I know I'm hey I'm standing up here

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:57,069
sweating so it mainly so we can hear it

00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,540
on the recordings outdoors so is there

00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,369
any chance that something like this

00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,460
could be ported over to the front end so

00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,800
if you have a site that regular users

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,230
are going to glog in and start using the

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,800
backend elements that they'd also have a

00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:13,930
front end to match it well hopefully

00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,010
this theme is going to be so amazing

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,569
that you want to use it on your

00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,220
front-end that's actually one of my file

00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,810
I know it sounds like arrogant this way

00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:24,010
I have a company called the me machine

00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:25,810
right but the idea is I have to inflate

00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,550
it because if I don't impress you guys

00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,770
economy mock me for years

00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:33,339
no but the idea is to make admin themes

00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:35,079
that are so visual appealing that I mean

00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:37,240
we're using the admin theme more than

00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,069
using the fondant theme and it should I

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,170
would hope that we could like completely

00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:42,609
remove that barrier so our site would

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,170
become that pretty actually that we

00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:47,740
didn't even have an admin theme which is

00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:51,359
like beautiful all the way but that's

00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,359
really really hard and complicated

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:57,260
so is this a Drupal 8 theme just because

00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,910
you started now and Drupal 8 is out or

00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,680
are you actually using things about

00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,700
Drupal 8 that are different from Drupal

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,440
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:08,780
so about almost a year ago when we were

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,970
done doing got Drupal 8 out and I was

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,280
sitting and looking at the last Google 7

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,860
side I did I decided never again to

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,810
trust Google 7 because it doesn't have

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,910
trick inside of it and that I used a lot

00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,369
of my life on it it was simply a

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,560
personal choice - never again worked in

00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:27,590
Drupal 7 because I got I got frustrated

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,080
angry and hateful and instead of being

00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:32,750
joyful and smiling as I'm usually all

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,150
kind of is I'm now so right now it's

00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,430
only Drupal 7 the true blade I could

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,590
totally see if somebody take all the

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,680
design principles and begin to pull them

00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,540
back I can tell you to see that happen

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,190
which would make a lot of sense which I

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,619
would love if somebody want to build

00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,730
that come and join the fight or the

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,790
party

00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:55,400
I would think personally ever to do

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,230
anything in Drupal 7 again I've said no

00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,300
to a whole bunch of projects because I

00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,160
don't want to work into a 7 and I hate

00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,869
to go sailing with a passion and it does

00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,850
not make me happy and I really want to

00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:06,410
move forward the same thing here's like

00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:09,230
the way I'm building this is very much

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,420
cutting it browsers because as I figured

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,850
out with like you know icons that was

00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,869
not supported by Firefox well Firefox is

00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:19,640
going to catch up and that might going

00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:21,830
to be a little bit dangerous but this is

00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,690
not built for Google core it's built our

00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,910
Lincoln trip we can always fix those

00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,040
those are technical issues this project

00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:30,770
is not about checklist it's about fixing

00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,720
design issues first and then fixing it

00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,280
technically so there might going to be a

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,280
bunch of things that I have no idea how

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,290
to fix and that's why I need other

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,210
designers to play with me and I need

00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,530
other developers to hopefully fix all

00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,250
the things I don't know anything about

00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:49,600
because I might it's why we have a

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:52,580
community for it any more questions

00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:55,580
should I actually let you all - well

00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,770
then thank you for not heckling me too

00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,930
much and thank you for attending and I

00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,060
hope that you're gonna jump in and

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,599
they'll give me feedback on this play

00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,739
around with it download it

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,210
we're going to break this side it

00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,190
probably will because it's highly

00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,779
experimental but this is a thing I'm

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,420
going to be keep on pushing at least for

00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:14,970
the next six to eight months thank you

00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:32,579
for to Pfizer for doing that and thank

00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:37,940
you guys for showing up at what I am I

00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:47,670
considered what oh yeah we are

00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:51,380
dude I'm old as hey man I know it's

00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,380
just going to be like nice to work with

00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,539
