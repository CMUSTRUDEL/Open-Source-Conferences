Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Baby Steps, Lessons Learned & Big plans for Drupal Diversity and Inclusion
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	The Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Working Group (DD&I) was formed after DrupalCon New Orleans and has spent the last year working to build a more inclusive, diverse and respectful Drupal Community.  In this session, we’ll review our successes (and challenges) of 2016 and share our plans for 2017.  

The DD&I working group was founded after a session (co-presented by drnikki) and a BOF at DrupalCon 2016 in New Orleans.  Participants called for an on-going process to continue this work.  Since then, we've continued the conversation every week, have created a space for discussion about these issues, and have made immense progress on diversity initiatives, including helping the Drupal Association craft the Inclusion Scholarship and learn more about presenter demographics for DrupalCon Baltimore.  We're proud of the work we've done, but we need more voices, and we need your help.

We want to discuss the motivations behind our work, the community’s priorities, and what actions we can take for 2017.  This session is an invitation to all conference attendees to participate, have your voices heard, and affect change in the inclusiveness and diversity of the Drupal community.
