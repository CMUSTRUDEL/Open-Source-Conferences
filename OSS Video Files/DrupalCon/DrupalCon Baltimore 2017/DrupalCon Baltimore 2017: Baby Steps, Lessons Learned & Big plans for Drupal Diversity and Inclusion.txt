Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Baby Steps, Lessons Learned & Big plans for Drupal Diversity and Inclusion
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	The Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Working Group (DD&I) was formed after DrupalCon New Orleans and has spent the last year working to build a more inclusive, diverse and respectful Drupal Community.  In this session, we’ll review our successes (and challenges) of 2016 and share our plans for 2017.  

The DD&I working group was founded after a session (co-presented by drnikki) and a BOF at DrupalCon 2016 in New Orleans.  Participants called for an on-going process to continue this work.  Since then, we've continued the conversation every week, have created a space for discussion about these issues, and have made immense progress on diversity initiatives, including helping the Drupal Association craft the Inclusion Scholarship and learn more about presenter demographics for DrupalCon Baltimore.  We're proud of the work we've done, but we need more voices, and we need your help.

We want to discuss the motivations behind our work, the community’s priorities, and what actions we can take for 2017.  This session is an invitation to all conference attendees to participate, have your voices heard, and affect change in the inclusiveness and diversity of the Drupal community.

Attendees Will Leave With:

An understanding of the DD&I group, its policies and its members
Ways to get involved in the DD&I group regardless of your available free time
Opportunities to participate in strategy and logistics conversations throughout the conference week

hello well the last couple of stragglers

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:18,270
come in yeah if you could maybe not

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,119
leave random empty seats on the side so

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,550
that late comers can find seats I'm

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,720
sorry that we're behind a podium I wish

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,939
that we could sit at the table and do

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,250
this but they have to record audio so I

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,020
know that this is an ideal and maybe for

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,219
the comp like the conversation part in

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,620
the question/answer part we all kind of

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,890
come forward a little bit

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,260
hello welcome this is the talk about the

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,149
Drupal diversity and inclusion group

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,879
this is our official title we wanted to

00:00:45,149 --> 00:01:01,559
pick something catchy but also long so

00:00:49,879 --> 00:01:02,699
this is what we picked before we have to

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,360
figure out how to make the slides go

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:10,650
forward okay okay everything's fine

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,270
before we even tell you who we are I

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,720
want to talk about the goal of why we're

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,790
here and it's not to define the bounce

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,280
not to talk about what the intricacies

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,869
of diversity are it's not to talk about

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,759
all the ways that we can include people

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,520
is to talk specifically about what our

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,990
group has done over the last year and to

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,229
give you just enough context that we can

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,640
have a conversation about that just has

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,470
a little bit of level setting so I'll

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,150
not speak for Ruby I'm Nicki

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,650
I've been in duple for about nine years

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,290
I don't know how old my ddoddo account

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,070
is but I've been a programmer back in

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,110
devs for about 19 years and I started

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,860
this whole thing after New Orleans and

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,860
we'll talk about that in a minute

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,540
hey I'm Ruby Sandra I've been making

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,180
websites mostly for nonprofit

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,680
organizations since the mid 1990s and I

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,930
mean it says it up there already

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,160
I usually when I'm doing a flight I like

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,530
to tell people like other stuff like

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
that I'm a human being I'm a mom I live

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,090
in Durham North Carolina

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,010
and I love music and stuff like that

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,580
like we're regular people and obviously

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:27,550
you can you can find us there I'm also

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:30,280
human being so just a little bit of

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,660
background then on how the Drupal

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,090
diversity and inclusion groups started

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,280
didi and I for short this is my little

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,380
kind of rah-rah background I am here in

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,210
Drupal and I started this group because

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,640
primarily I believe in open source I

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,680
believe in the values that it stands for

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,600
I believe in doing work and giving it

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,660
away and I believe that that benefits

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,760
all of us and I also believe related to

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,230
open source in the power of community so

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,820
I believe in doing open source work by

00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,890
yourself and I believe in doing open

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,300
source work with other people who also

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,100
believe in open source I believe in the

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,959
power of individuals to change the

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,950
communities that they're part of and we

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,810
see this all the time with local

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,110
neighborhood boards and we see this on

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,290
large scale with voting right

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,600
individuals as discrete units have the

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,700
power to affect change and individuals

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,780
and collectives have even greater power

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,959
to affect change we all have heard that

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,340
Drupal is a democracy so when I looked

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,350
at the Drupal community and I thought

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:39,130
well um I wish someone we're doing this

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,170
man jeez if only someone would do this

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,840
and I thought about that honestly for a

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,200
couple of years wow we really need this

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,230
why hasn't someone done this yet um

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,630
finally I was like well hell damn it

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,209
cool okay if I want this badly enough I

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,890
will just do it myself and I have not

00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,810
done it myself I started it and then

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,299
have done it with a ton of other

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,580
wonderful people but out of this

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,739
philosophy came the Drupal diversity and

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,730
inclusion group and we are and these are

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,280
probably the most important things to

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,580
know about us we are volunteers and we

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,799
work totally in the open so all of the

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,720
work that we do happens on github

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,039
because I'm a developer and I want to

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,250
start something and so I just go put it

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:26,920
on github and in retrospect I could

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,410
maybe made a different choice to make it

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,910
more accessible for everybody but that's

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:38,980
where we are we might change that moving

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:44,830
forward and I have a slide about that

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:47,590
it's not important that's right we

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,030
people have said that we work in secret

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,030
whatever work it is that people think

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,470
that we do but we don't every literally

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,450
everything that we do is on github

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,270
everything is accessible all of our

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,470
meeting notes are there all of the

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,240
things that we're going to be working on

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,900
exist in our issue queue and our

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,340
meetings are in flux which is also open

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:14,530
some important things that we are not we

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,000
are not you're laughing because

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,370
affiliation with the DEA is funny I

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,440
think I'm sure that you I'm sure that

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,090
that's why you're laughing

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,220
we're not affiliated with the Drupal

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,130
Association although like Ruby said they

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,390
gave us booth space very generously and

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,640
they helped us they printed the banner

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,780
that's that designed but we're not

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,010
affiliated with the DEA we're not

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,950
affiliated with the community working

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,419
group we're not affiliated with trees

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,800
you know he mentioned us this morning

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,560
but I didn't even know that he knew

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,000
about us until a couple of weeks ago and

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,669
we're not a bunch of other things we are

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,260
not funded we had a couple of people our

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,870
generous donors donate to the photo

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,330
booths that we're doing a company paid

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,400
for our stickers but would not in no way

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,930
are we funded we don't report to anybody

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,080
except ourselves and our own sense of

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,479
right and wrong and we in general don't

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,590
let people boss us around to the best of

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:16,510
our ability so Ruby is going to tell you

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,410
about the things that we actually do one

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,940
of the things that I've been telling

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,130
people a lot who visit our tables is

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,860
that because we're just a group of

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,510
volunteers and members we what we do is

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,150
based on the interests of the members of

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,669
our group so for one thing we're

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,340
advocating for a more inclusive and more

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,730
diverse Drupal community

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,430
the other thing about this right

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:42,440
now I have to drive you're right it's

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:45,350
trickier than this on these right so

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,420
when we say a more diverse community any

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,800
time as you probably know any time you

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,260
try to list these kinds of things it's

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,490
extremely problematic but we thought

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,020
it'd be helpful to give some examples of

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,000
what kind of thing we're talking about

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,460
so as you can also understand what kind

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,460
of thing we're not talking about and

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,080
there's been there's there's been

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,520
there's been many different issues that

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,560
they even come on to our radar in terms

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,970
of different types of diversity we might

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
not even thought about like I wasn't

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,020
really thinking about ableism six months

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,740
ago in the Drupal community but now it's

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:20,180
on my radar so we are we are pretty

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,860
broad but not everything the next thing

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,620
we do is advocate for more inclusive

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,230
events there's a couple of ways we've

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,940
done that what does that mean inclusion

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,920
means not just like you look around the

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,470
room and you see people who aren't just

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,540
white men but they're actually people

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,270
who aren't white men are a part of the

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,880
process are are engaged in every way as

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,440
much as anybody else would be there's a

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,580
lot of interesting language around this

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,860
and I recommend googling it because

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,150
there's some great articles actually but

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,380
specifically some of the things we've

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,570
done are helping the DEA with organizing

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,240
DrupalCon when they wanted to measure

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,070
the diversity of the group here

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,420
they added some demographic questions to

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,100
the registration form this year which

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,780
I'm sure you all saw and we helped

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,130
advise them about how to do that because

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,020
again those things are very fraught and

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,360
there's no perfect way but we try to get

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,120
the questions framed in a useful and

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,830
productive way also some folks in our

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
group are working on a packet for camp

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,880
organizers about how to make more

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,920
inclusive events at the local level as

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:25,640
well things happen if I'm forgetting

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,870
anything so I don't know how much to say

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,330
about this this is something that comes

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:37,550
up you know diversity doesn't mean

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,900
universalism and for example and we have

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,790
another slide that mentions this later

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,030
but the but the thing that I think

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,590
explains it the best is if you make it a

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,060
point to include every single person

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,410
that actually inherently excludes

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,480
certain people

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,730
because just to use the ridiculous

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,930
example of Nazis right like oh well we

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,940
can't exclude them just because they're

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,709
Nazis well if you include those people

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,829
then some other people may feel not so

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,180
welcome right so there are some limits

00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:04,610
when we want to include people it

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,230
doesn't actually mean universal it means

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,730
making the space an inclusive one for

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,129
people who want to be in there and be a

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:15,769
part of it that making sense so here's

00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,800
the here's the resource packet for for

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,790
organizers and this is all living on

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,949
github right now too

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,189
so anybody can contribute and help us

00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:28,189
out did we talk about our meetings looks

00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:30,889
like yeah outside of it hey that's us

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:34,910
that's our photo booth so yeah look

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:38,420
we're wearing the same clothes no

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,029
trickery here so another awesome idea

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,279
that one of our one of our group members

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,759
had was to have a photo booth here at

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,379
DrupalCon

00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,329
to take pictures to highlight the

00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,769
diversity of a Drupal community many of

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,079
you all have already had your pictures

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,800
taken if you haven't you should come by

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,880
and we're taking little tiny Polaroids

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,290
that you can see on the back there and

00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,300
we're posting those on Instagram as well

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,959
and we're using the hashtag which I love

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,910
and partial humans of Drupal hashtag so

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,170
if you like humans of New York it's kind

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,970
of awesome

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,970
so that's another example of making this

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,410
event more diverse and inclusive for

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,389
people because it's highlighting some

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,040
yeah your your Drupal and your Drupal 2

00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,040
and your Drupal and all these people

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:28,579
creating safe spaces such as our slack

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,430
right so if you all this is there's no

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,259
official Drupal slack but one of the

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,839
contributors to Drupal decided hey we

00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,519
gotta have slack and we have one and

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,649
it's just a few volunteer moderators

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,199
it's totally free functions a lot like

00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:47,329
IRC always has except that it's usable

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,399
look slight improvement there I know

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,449
sorry I know some people love their IRC

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,370
and much respect but I turn it on and

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,350
then I never go back there but slack I

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,890
leave it open all day and I'm there so

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,410
we we started a channel there and

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,110
in addition to our meetings weekly in

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,920
flack we're hanging out there all the

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,240
time so that is a really great space for

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,800
especially for if people are having

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,110
issues where they can come and talk

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,240
about them and we can figure out what

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,649
might be needed we can help back them up

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,529
and say no you're not crazy that was

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:23,920
inappropriate or whatever it might be we

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,500
can rally the troops if needed and it's

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,209
been a really great space is that our

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,269
current number 363 members yes I think

00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:37,630
it's 400 now right we used to have about

00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:41,470
a hundred or so what was it before but

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,180
there's been some greater interest but

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,980
to be honest not that many people are

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,000
actually participating in the group they

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,709
are just hanging out in our slack

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
channel but maybe I think because they

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,680
feel like they can learn from us and I

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,329
can a lot of people have come to our

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,820
channel frankly just to sort of learn

00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,050
and get different perspectives again

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,279
especially recently when things have

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,190
been really confusing and very

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,160
complicated we have had a space where

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,070
people can safely talk about stuff and

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,970
it has been very very helpful possibly

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,640
too helpful no another great idea one of

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,190
our members had was to have this flag of

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,050
approachability because DrupalCon could

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,899
be kind of intimidating and it's also

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,610
just hard to talk to strangers always so

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,680
you can come to our table I've got a

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,230
couple right here and get me smiley pin

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,730
smiley face pins to put on your badge to

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,829
show that strangers can come up and talk

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,570
to you and lots of you already have them

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:32,860
they're really awesome I think it's

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,430
perfect because I hate talking to

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,579
strangers so it's really great opening

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,560
and then building capacity of our allies

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,940
this is about people a lot of people

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,370
want to be allies in the Drupal

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,630
community people want this to be a more

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,560
inclusive space but they don't always

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,510
know how and nobody's a know bits of

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,100
expert but it's another thing that we

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,690
can do by hat by even having the space

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,910
where we have the conversations and

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,860
where we talk to each other and we share

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,779
resources and new perspectives with each

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,570
other so this is sort of showing on the

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,380
right going going from active opposition

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,760
all the way over to being active allies

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,430
and I have definitely seen some people

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,580
and even I on certain issues have have

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:19,450
moved across the spectrum on different

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,800
issues people we really we have a really

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,360
great group in there and we have really

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,840
been able to help each other a lot and

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,490
learn a lot from each other and hearing

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,660
each other's perspectives is fascinating

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,190
for example as you can see I've been

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,480
involved with Drupal for a long time but

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,550
I don't really know how those inner

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,960
workings and stuff go but there's some

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,580
people in our channel who are core

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,360
contributors have been involved for a

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,560
decade or more

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,940
and they have some different

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,590
perspectives that I've that I've never

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,320
been exposed to and I learned a lot from

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,840
that they also didn't realize what it

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,880
looks like to be someone like me who's

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,610
like what the hell is going on here what

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,720
is trees like what you know because your

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,860
core contributor you work with trees

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,250
every day you don't know what that's

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:01,360
like to be us so we're all benefiting by

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,710
sharing those perspectives and making

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,850
better allies within the Drupal

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,390
community so that folks can be more

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,400
effective advocates and just on an on

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,930
just in a like a technical ecosystem

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,700
it's been really good for me personally

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,410
to remember that people are not not

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,910
everybody's a developer just like I

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,890
started my thing and I put it on github

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,570
everybody will be fine

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,560
and so talking to people who are site

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,120
builders and project managers and

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,410
content strategists and designers and

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,430
all of those things has been really

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:32,370
helpful oh yeah here's how we got here

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,370
hey on a calendar I'm not a designer

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:39,790
yeah y'all know so just if you're

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,370
curious we started in New Orleans we met

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:45,450
an IRC in June we migrated over to slack

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,450
in June

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,810
so the wonderful folks at Drupal camp

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,100
Costa Rica highly recommended it they

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,320
had me down and I key noted about

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,940
diversity down there which kicked off

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,100
some more stuff we went to bad camp and

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,690
a bunch of people who are more organized

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,250
than me or like hey probably get a

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,529
domain name probably sign up for Twitter

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,750
so I had a lot of help with that and

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:13,000
then we did a diversity of the web

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,540
survey which is still going on we still

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,339
need people to take that survey and then

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,100
in January around that time we helped

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,750
the DA with some Baltimore stuff up next

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,750
is a meme ready

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,960
[Laughter]

00:15:42,240 --> 00:16:06,640
we made it yet we didn't we didn't find

00:15:45,610 --> 00:16:08,440
it online so I'm I think most people we

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,870
love most I love most people I'm not

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,270
trying to speak for as a global we and

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,880
for our organization there is no global

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,850
we we as an organization are just a

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,320
group of people if anyone says we as

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,640
DeeDee and I do X and we believe X we

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,050
don't have any positions on anything

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,510
officially right we have some guidelines

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,339
within which we work we have a strategy

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,260
meeting tomorrow at which point we may

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,910
decide that we have an official

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,500
spokesperson or we have an official

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,910
position on something but right now we

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,250
don't we're just an organization that's

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,750
doing things and we're just here to talk

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,430
about the things that we do and to get

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,160
more people involved and to answer

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,390
questions that you have do you want to

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,040
talk about the things that we have

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:53,260
accidentally done over the last couple

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,959
of weeks one of the things I was worried

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,360
about a lot just in making this meme in

00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,650
general and all this stuff is to avoid

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,020
the perception that were by

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,790
two white women doing this stuff is

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,650
actually a much more diverse group than

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,600
that and a lot of you are in the room so

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:12,790
anybody who's been active in our black

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:21,250
channel please stand up right now look

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:22,390
at our awesome Posse and there's more

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,530
but that's just who's here just so you

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:32,200
can see it's not just that so the recent

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:34,809
unpleasantness so what happened is there

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,190
we all know about the situation with

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:42,670
Larry Garfield right was gonna be the

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:45,070
first time anybody you for sure okay

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:50,980
so I've had some practice with this

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:53,230
hopefully I'll you know okay so as Drees

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,510
mentioned this morning recently a

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,190
contributor a very involved core

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,070
contributor was asked to leave the

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,280
community and was also relieved of his

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,800
position as a tract chair for DrupalCon

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,230
and there a lot of people have strong

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,710
feelings about it it's a very

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:14,020
complicated issue some people in my

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,900
opinion have looked at it as sort of

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,900
black and white but there are many many

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,040
shades of grey it's very complicated

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,280
I'll tell you what happened to me

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,840
the morning I woke up and found in the

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,200
slack channel someone who's in Europe

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,390
had already posted a link to a blog post

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,750
by Larry who had been asked to leave and

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,760
I read that and I was like yeah this is

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,270
not this is unfair what the hell burn it

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,830
down this isn't right and so I start you

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,200
know we're all in there posting around

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,120
white sofa but because of the benefit of

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,300
the many perspectives that we have in

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,480
our channel I learned much more about

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,400
the various complexities of the

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,900
situation the history I never even

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,070
worked with this person which most of

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,200
the people who have opinions about it

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,490
don't as a matter of fact right I've

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,010
never worked this person I didn't know

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,200
what they were like I learned about the

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,880
history of their relationship I learned

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,310
about the process because I didn't

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,429
understand what the community working

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,539
group was doing and what it wasn't and I

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,950
think we all agree

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:18,009
one thing that I think everybody agrees

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,539
on is that we have discovered if you

00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,729
didn't already know that there are some

00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,499
real problems in our community structure

00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:27,220
we're lacking the infrastructure to

00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:28,389
handle issues like this but through

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,159
participating that channel I learned

00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,960
about what how things went and that it

00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,379
did follow the process it's supposed to

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,249
follow and throughout the day more and

00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:39,909
more people we're going through that

00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:41,559
same process I was going what and in our

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,539
channel we just kept talking to each

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,710
other we kept processing things we're

00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,080
like well but I'm still concerned about

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:52,809
this and they're just that you know

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,609
endless concern yeah yeah we are thank

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,399
goodness for the adorable dogs in our

00:19:54,609 --> 00:20:02,440
channel because I think that's what I

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:03,940
look like and all day long people keep

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,960
coming in and actually not all day long

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,269
but then actually for weeks and because

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,580
we were and frankly we're pretty active

00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,169
about moderating our Channel

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,899
and I have a lot of experience running

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,489
online communities locally and in

00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:22,539
various places actually not just locally

00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:24,129
and but we stayed on top of it everyone

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,599
in our channel who we had already been

00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,979
there and this is important that we had

00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,869
been there working with each other for

00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:30,970
months and months at that point so we

00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,470
trusted each other if someone else said

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,849
well but you need to think about this

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,779
Ruby I thought yeah but you're saying

00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,129
that because you're white man or

00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,429
something but I knew these people and

00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:41,649
they knew me were allies it's true that

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,909
that trust was really important to us

00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:44,529
being able to have a good conversation

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,979
there

00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:50,169
and so because we had these great

00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:51,580
conversations and were able to be

00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,399
rational about it which there wasn't

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:57,159
that much going on at the time more and

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,379
more people were referred to us and when

00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,479
people had concerns folks from the

00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:03,279
drupal board and others were just saying

00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:05,289
go talk to the diversity and inclusion

00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,769
group because they I don't know

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:10,599
understand it or something which was

00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,789
interesting because it meant that we

00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,129
were that we were very busy acting as

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,529
therapists for several weeks of all the

00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:20,049
angry people coming in there now some

00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,340
people were just like of your therapist

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,770
would say right some people were ready

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,980
to change

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,450
some people not so much

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,570
and people who came in with their guns

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,159
blazing and not listening usually left

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,899
really angrily after a little while

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,460
because we didn't really tolerate that

00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,440
foolishness it's our space that's like

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,399
our room where we do our stuff and we

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,700
weren't going to have them coming in

00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:45,630
there you know crapping all over us and

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,419
over things that we care about so that

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,120
has caused our groups profile to be

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,899
raised a lot much more than we intended

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,610
or anticipated but you know there's the

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:58,529
silver lining obviously is it now people

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,419
know what we're doing and a lot of

00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,370
people did listen a lot of people joined

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,919
our group since then and and became

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,870
participants and a lot of people are

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,149
seeing the needs for improvements in the

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,919
community partially related to the

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,159
situation with Larry and partially

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:22,399
related to the broader perspective

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:25,649
second so what's cool about this is

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:27,419
you're all here right all of a sudden

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,190
all of these people whether they had

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,140
thought about it or not are like we need

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,990
to think about how people experience our

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,640
communities well whichever side you're

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,659
on if you believe in taking sides even I

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,500
there are already sides I'm just being

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:46,679
diplomatic but but still people are now

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,190
thinking well how do I feel a member of

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,899
this community

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,520
do I feel safe in this community because

00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:52,260
the person next to me feel safe in this

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,700
community and those are things that are

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,070
important those are questions we should

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,720
always be asking is this person who I'm

00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,250
passing in the hallway having an okay

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,520
experience are they feeling threatened

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,799
are they feeling safe which means that

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,190
it's time to join the duel Chrissie and

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,649
it's time to get involved one of the

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,649
common pieces of feedback that I got

00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:18,149
before recent events was people would

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:20,240
say oh well I'm you know I'm just I'm

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:22,380
just me I shouldn't get involved

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,000
whatever dimension of identity they

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,580
thought that they needed to have in

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,500
order to be an ally they felt like they

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,909
were missing does that make sense people

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,110
would say you know what I'm just I'm

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:35,960
just a light guy I don't I can't

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,660
I can't help and I'm here to say that

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,460
that's not true if you didn't receive

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:45,320
one in the mail this is your official

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:48,260
invitation to join us to get on the

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,060
Allied spectrum and to let us help you

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,160
figure out ways that you can be an ally

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,110
that's sustainable for you I'm going to

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,120
do a tiny plug for my talk on Thursday

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,090
called a hundred ways to be an ally

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,790
there are literally 100 there more I'm

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,410
only sharing 100 of them with you in 30

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,850
minutes ways that you can be an ally and

00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,280
in there you'll find ways that are

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,950
sustainable for you to be a part of this

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,130
but specifically you can get involved in

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,020
our github repo and if you have github

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,610
phobia or other github challenges come

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,650
talk to me we'll figure it out

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,600
we have weekly meetings in our slack

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,310
channel you can follow us on Twitter

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,090
Ruby runs our social media which is a

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,290
Herculean task especially lately and you

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,170
can come to our booth and take pictures

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:33,550
and for minutes early we will start the

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,550
question thank you very much

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:48,870
oh yes Kathy just made a great point of

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:51,250
reminding me to explain how this works

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,900
core conversations is where we talk for

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,640
30 minutes and then we do Q&A for 30

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,300
minutes so that's the track that we're

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,310
in so we have done our 24 and a half

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,480
minutes of talking and now we have about

00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,860
30 minutes if you want to talk about

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,630
what we're doing you have questions

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,820
about diversity or inclusion or the

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:13,410
Drupal community or anything that you

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,410
want if you don't have any you can leave

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,450
hi my name is Vlad win' I'm a human as

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,030
well

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:28,000
welcome human thank you it wasn't hard I

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,370
was born this way so you mentioned

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,080
tolerance and you were we specifically

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,210
mentioned you can't tolerate intolerance

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,920
it's like you can't rationalize with the

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,940
irrational which is a really good point

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:43,150
to make right so where do we draw a line

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,880
but actively but not not make that a

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,370
hard line that is discriminatory right I

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,650
think that's where this makes that this

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,740
becomes complicated like how do we set a

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:57,070
guideline to be inclusive and have

00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,110
certain tolerances without objectifying

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,480
other people based on those tolerances

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,040
and those values because if we create a

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,230
box or a white list or a black list

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,890
that's immediately discriminatory right

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:12,370
so that's I think why this group exists

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,820
so that we can Evan flow with the

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,410
community at large and and kind of

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,870
define our diversity by our actions

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,780
right so not exactly a question I did

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,760
this wrong you did okay you did great

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,290
thank you it's hard to go first grade

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,700
but I think that kind of that's kind of

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,310
the impetus for this right like why

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,810
we're having this mop now at this event

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,370
you know and why we're getting a lot of

00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,740
people involved in this group even more

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,900
now because it's really in the lights

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,620
right we we all see this as a big issue

00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,320
and just like when we went from archaic

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,360
PHP to new PHP we don't have to go from

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,670
old governance to new governance it's a

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,960
hard transition well we're not going to

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,450
talk about governance sure sure

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,090
so I will draw one line there but

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,250
diversity plays a role in that it does

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,120
so I will just address this last part

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,130
and then I'll let Ruby talk about

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,640
tolerance I'll tolerate Ruby talking

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,930
about tolerance governance conversations

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,400
are happening community governance

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,620
conversations are happening for those of

00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,920
you who don't know they're in an office

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,290
a couple of sky bridges away

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,460
we have pamphlets on our DNI table if

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,870
you want to figure out how to get there

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,070
and what they're about and they're

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,690
specifically for people who have

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,370
concerns about the governance model

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,750
about how the working group made the

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,040
choices that they made how Drees made

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,540
the choices he made and whether or not

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,290
those are the right choices in the right

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,210
way those concerns are real and valid

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:37,030
and also outside of our initial scope

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:39,500
such as their exact as for tolerance

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,830
well I wanted to say if you think about

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,890
the that little diagram of the ally

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,200
spectrum one of the things that I think

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,110
is useful to think about is if you're

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:55,130
thinking about a person who's who seems

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:59,060
intolerant there's there a person just

00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,650
like us and there's personally I believe

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,060
there's potential for good in every

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,760
single person that's just like a

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,650
personal belief that I have and so I

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,480
would think that spectrum included

00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,520
started with active opposition that's

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,290
what's on that but that's but it's not

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,440
there's no big line between it there's a

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:19,820
gradual little process so if there's a

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,220
way to work with someone to help convert

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,530
them from a from opposition to neutral

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:28,100
you know and possibly onto Ally ideally

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:30,020
right then I think it's productive to

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,870
make that space and to be open to people

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,420
who want to you know who are open to

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,700
that and have the potential for that but

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,460
the on the flip side is we do want to

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,340
have a safe space and so if people's

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,410
behavior is a problem that is disruptive

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,690
to others it is threatening to others

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,070
that is making people just not feel

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,140
welcome in the space because that's a

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,760
real problem I mean you know and not

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,900
just women have impostor syndrome last

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,730
year I went to the little impostor

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,490
syndrome talk and I was like there's

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,830
moon here man habit it's true like all

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,860
of us really all of us travel with like

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,990
do I belong here

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,000
right and so that's why I think it's

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,320
important not to make space for people

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,929
who are going to make others not feel

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,210
welcome so there's never going to be one

00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,710
single line and our group doesn't have

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,600
any official positions about that so we

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,970
don't have like a talking point this is

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:33,390
okay and this isn't okay there's a

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:35,340
spectrum so the people who are actively

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:39,919
intolerant right there has to be a

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:42,330
willingness on or actively opposed right

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,860
well I meant actually opposed sorry on

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,900
the spectrum I misspoke

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,390
so correction actively opposed there has

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,880
to be a willingness in those individuals

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,520
to want to change their behavior so how

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,100
do we as a group as a community as other

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,270
humans kind of facilitate that change

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:02,160
how do we do it in a way that is not

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,830
discriminatory or defamatory or negative

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,000
well I think is a really hard I think

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,830
you do it with things like codes of

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,790
conduct where you basically say if you

00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,799
want to be a part of this community

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,900
here's some of the baselines of the

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,940
community agrees are needed and if

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,559
people can't deal with that they can

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,690
then they've made the choice to opt

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,640
themself out of it basically so I mean I

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,179
think it's by it's by defining what your

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,679
norms are going to be and and so that by

00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,740
that way you can say well this action

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,970
this isn't conforming this is not okay

00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:35,190
of course that is very hard to write

00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,240
those um so you kind of already answered

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,760
my question so maybe I shouldn't even

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,120
ask it but it was a on a similar vein to

00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,429
that like where to draw the line for not

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,559
being tolerant of intolerance like the

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,000
the ideas of course that you won't want

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,770
to include people who make other people

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,010
feel uncomfortable and the Nazi example

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,660
is so easy I know because it's lazy

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,280
well yeah because he's not to to

00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,010
actively want the genocide of certain

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,080
people but then there's so much gray

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,400
area like for example and I don't want

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,770
anyone to take sense of this but to say

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,510
like a trump voter they don't actively

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,460
want to kill someone but they might have

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,280
or someone else might assume that they

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,169
have opinions about for example Mexican

00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,429
so if you are have Mexican heritage

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,299
maybe if there's a Trump person there

00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,940
you would feel on

00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:21,059
cluded mm-hmm so then how do you make

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,679
those well again that's why it comes

00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,210
back to the sort of saying you know this

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,950
is a community that respects people and

00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,129
doesn't tolerate racist speech for

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,840
example so that if so that you know we

00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:34,470
have to you can't police people stuff

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,419
you know only their behavior one of the

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,960
problem is that a lot of behavior isn't

00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,389
recognized as being problematic when it

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,999
actually is so I think that's something

00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:46,259
that we need to work on more if you

00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:48,570
think about you know the history of

00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,340
people you know the like nfx going to

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,609
split like this is the famous thread

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,359
about the gender forum on on drupal.org

00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:56,970
right

00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,049
like people can all be very polite and

00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,789
they're not breaking any rules of

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,230
civility but they can still be doing

00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:03,509
things that are hostile and make other

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,889
people not feel welcome by by literally

00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:07,950
not recognizing their own gender

00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:10,230
identity for example so I think it

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,919
should still be focused on on actions

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,299
and not thoughts but that we have to

00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,419
recognize a lot more actions as

00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,489
problematic than we do right now and it

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,710
will add that as a developer I want to

00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,269
write everything down and I want things

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,309
to be explicit and I want to factor for

00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,629
edge cases right and I want to I want to

00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,239
have a flowchart for everything and I

00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:31,529
want to be prepared for everything and I

00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,909
mean not even that that always works in

00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:36,059
engineering right but that's the

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,769
instinct and I think what I have found

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,720
over the last year and before is that

00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:42,600
this is so much on a case by case basis

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,299
and so much conversation and empathy and

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,619
back and forth and listening and

00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,330
clarification is needed that it really

00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,269
is it's like okay well in this case it

00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:52,919
seemed offensive but it's actually okay

00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,509
someone you know to people in good faith

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,769
and understood each other in this case

00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,379
it seemed okay but it was actually very

00:32:55,769 --> 00:33:00,590
problematic and that's really

00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,590
frustrating

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:14,140
so kind of in response to Eric's

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,340
question / problem statement and it

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,650
responds to a couple of things I think

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,380
Ruby said during the dialogue I think

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,780
it's important to remind ourselves that

00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,760
intolerance is not a trait of a person

00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,780
people have the capacity to change and

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,260
it's an important to remember that

00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:34,360
people have a variety of different

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:40,730
motivations or exposure to like how to

00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:42,860
not be exclusive right so it's I just

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,380
want to encourage us to be careful to

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:49,010
not assume that there is a binary thing

00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:51,680
just just if someone does something once

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,600
and the first time you call them out on

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,220
doing something that was maybe you

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,650
shouldn't have said this horribly

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,150
offensive thing their first reaction the

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,160
first time I hear it might be just to

00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,710
get defensive and put up a wall and not

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,030
listen and then maybe the second time I

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,700
hear it maybe they hear it and like

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,810
someone told this to me before

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,340
why are they saying this maybe I'll

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,899
listen for a little bit before I get

00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,780
angry or else I'll get angry and then

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:16,490
I'll listen the second and and I think

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,470
that we like it's important to remember

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,600
that that when someone like we're all

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,460
going to screw up at some point and do

00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,770
things that are on site wanted acardo's

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,669
to not say this person is intolerant

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:31,669
because people have the capacity to

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:33,590
become you know better and and and learn

00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,030
from others so that's all that's my

00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,500
comment which is not a question oh I'm

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,850
Jessica and I'm all for human sorry I

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:45,800
didn't follow the rules sorry Kathy

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:47,210
she only cares about to Mike and I and

00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,120
that's exactly what we saw over those

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,350
weeks after the Larry Garfield situation

00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,380
happened we thought people come in with

00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:56,720
guns blazing being very oppositional

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,030
it's saying oppositional things and then

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,840
being exposed exposed exposed and kind

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:04,100
of being really killer about it even if

00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,180
their beliefs hadn't change right they

00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,950
were able to engage in constructive

00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,140
conversation that helps people and it

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,030
went from like no you're dumb to like oh

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,840
okay we disagree but I still respect you

00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,460
the person right and that's the goal

00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,350
oh I mean ultimately that's the goal is

00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,360
like I think your idea is stupid but I

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,550
still respect you and I'm you know we're

00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,920
still physically safe with each other hi

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:27,530
Angie hi I just wanted to say on that

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,410
note that I really appreciate what you

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,980
guys have sorry what you folks have been

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:37,400
doing um no seriously because um it's

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:41,800
been a bit cementum really shitty couple

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,430
of weeks and I think having somebody

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,260
disconnected from the different

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,970
organizations and power structures that

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,990
you are doing the important work that

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:52,310
you're doing has been insanely valuable

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,780
because I've witnessed that I'm sorry

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,210
I'm not very active in your channel I

00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,920
didn't stand at the time but but I

00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,830
observe and I observe that that

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,930
literally anyone is welcome in that room

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,760
even if they're hot-headed even if

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,410
they're they're mouthing off at first

00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,900
they'll be treated like a person I'll be

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,430
saying I understand you're upset you

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,080
know talk to me about what's going on

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,540
they're able to have a sounding board

00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,910
that is neutral and and encourages

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,190
dialogue and I've seen you change hearts

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:21,650
and minds by treating people like people

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,180
and I think that is really important

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,340
because this issue has been so

00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,160
incredibly divisive and it's required

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,230
all these people to choose sides and get

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,400
pitchforks and stuff and it's like no we

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,620
don't need any of that we need to

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,530
remember that we're all here because we

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,200
love being here I like these people are

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,730
like my people you know it's like and I

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,350
just wanted to say thank you because

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,410
I've been on the back end of this kind

00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:48,800
of you know talking la don't say that

00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,420
you know it's what I do but um but you

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,030
know I'm just trying to

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:56,120
that whole situation and so having folks

00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:59,210
on the front lines who are really really

00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,920
genuinely interested in in in actual

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,020
diversity and inclusion of all broad

00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,400
spectrums of ideas and trying to get

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,320
everyone to a common understanding in a

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,330
place where we can like talk to each

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:22,820
other thank you I just want to say thank

00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:25,760
you so I'm Cathy and I have some

00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:30,320
experience working in open source and I

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,720
hear some words that people use like

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,890
Angie like we value the work that you do

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,020
and in the keynote you know like things

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:42,140
are really important and what are we

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:50,270
going to do about this and it reminds me

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:53,960
that it upsets me because uhm I see

00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:57,430
people who it's difficult for them to do

00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:01,240
this work and and they're being asked

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,240
sometimes to do it

00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:11,090
without an assistant support that could

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,630
be useful to accomplish that important

00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:19,120
work that we're really thankful for and

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:21,350
so I think it's frustrating to be like

00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,090
when something happens in the community

00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,310
like hey go talk to those diversity and

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,050
inclusion people like they have all the

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:30,140
time in the world and their lives aren't

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:33,290
hard so let's add some more work to them

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:37,070
so I find that upsetting in a similar

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,830
way that I have wanted the way that we

00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:41,630
fund development on open source to

00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:44,030
change I feel like if something is

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:48,680
really important to us then we need to

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:50,960
make it um really important and not

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,970
burden people who may not have the

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,500
resources or the power to be

00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,750
accomplishing the work or make changes

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,990
so it's just there's like an element to

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:05,430
this that is worrisome

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:09,480
also not a question it's more questions

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:12,060
its core conversation yep I agree with

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,130
that I will say personally I couldn't

00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,810
have done it this is here without canopy

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,310
without working for canopy and letting

00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,810
them be flexible with me to work later

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,930
hours because I'm running meetings or

00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:24,810
just even being here so I've been very

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:26,370
lucky but I do think that canopy

00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,100
shouldn't be subsidizing some work for

00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:31,110
the community we need to figure out a

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,120
way to do it we have a strategy meeting

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,100
tomorrow we're looking into it but to

00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,990
Angie's point we exist outside existing

00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,120
power structures that's also part of

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,920
what's so valuable and so it's how can

00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,600
we be sustainable and how can we prevent

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,280
burnout and how can we care for the

00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,840
people doing this work myself included

00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,180
right how can we care for everybody

00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,260
who's doing this and also not makes them

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,940
beholden to someone's bank accounts and

00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,110
I have to believe like any new

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,450
engineering challenge there is a

00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,980
solution to this we'll probably get it

00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,930
wrong maybe maybe we'll get it right the

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:05,190
first time who knows probably not so

00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:06,810
cassia probably not it is tricky but

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,270
it's something that we think because if

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,920
we were just at the next year were like

00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,140
the last two months we wouldn't make it

00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,500
the next year right so something has to

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,790
shift a little bit and I really

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,960
appreciate you saying that because there

00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,790
has been a lot of that and it's hot you

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,140
can't really see it we had people come

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,180
into the community who are just like

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,100
really angry and talking about

00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,420
everything and governance and we were

00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,890
just like look can you go to the

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,390
governance channel or something and

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,340
they're like well I was told to come

00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,290
talk to you but like that actually

00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,970
happened then I was like who told you

00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,200
that what you know so that is that's

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,880
been happening and so I do appreciate

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,350
the recognition I think that's getting

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,730
better though I think people were just

00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:47,160
everyone was freaking out and just going

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:48,630
back you know getting better I was going

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,400
to something pretty similar to Kathy I

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:58,500
guess sorry my name is Matt and yes I'm

00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:01,020
a human yeah this is amazing initiative

00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,640
that you and a few other people are

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,230
doing but like you

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,550
I'm I'm assuming you can only be the

00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,100
unpaid therapist of the Drupal community

00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,640
for like a like it's probably already

00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,680
too long yeah and then on top of that

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,830
there's the burden method like this is

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,150
people who have less privilege in a

00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,500
community for the most part who are

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,870
stepping up because they're the ones who

00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,430
see this as a problem

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,960
there's even though they're probably

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,880
already doing more work than other folks

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,880
just to like tread water and stay in the

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,740
community there's the fact that I see

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,300
often in mostly male communities that

00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,570
like a small number of women are

00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,130
responsible for the like emotional tone

00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,450
and maintenance of that because that's

00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,800
work is just invisible to everyone else

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,530
despite the fact that it's obviously

00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,300
necessary so yeah I guess my question

00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,650
was like how long do you think you can

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,470
keep this up slash what's your strategy

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,720
for going forward because like like

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,040
other than like just you know handing

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,690
out stickers and getting lots of people

00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,160
to join this channel and get excited

00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,950
late I'm assuming you're thinking about

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,790
that with some of the time so yeah yeah

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:05,890
we are and how can so it's like and

00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,060
you're and you're talking about how how

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,560
you said you're going to give another

00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,390
talk about how people can be allies

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,210
which I guess maybe this is a segue into

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,730
that but like how late yeah what where

00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:18,280
do you see what's going how can people

00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:20,880
help specifically with this issue if you

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,640
are someone who is business minded or

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,890
human network minded come come give

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,390
suggestions if you're someone who has

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,020
organized large groups of people in

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,240
sustainable ways

00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:35,260
let's talk and brainstorm how we can

00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,520
apply that and the other challenge

00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,680
though is that a lot of this work is

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,410
one-on-one work and it's hard to scale

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,540
one-on-one work up right so getting more

00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,880
people in the channel it's not always

00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,300
it's more work because now there's more

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,440
people so one thing that I've personally

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,880
been thinking about is how to make a

00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,860
network for men to do this work with

00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,210
each other because a lot of the problems

00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:59,050
and this don't take this the wrong way

00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:01,570
men are making these homes and it's the

00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,890
problems are trickling down right so how

00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,480
can we have men on the frontlines

00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,130
supporting other men to do this work

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,350
with each other and that would take a

00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,000
huge burden off of so many people who

00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,619
are already marginalized

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,930
and so if anyone wants to leave that

00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,109
mail initiative come at me that would be

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,109
amazing

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,109
come Atta throw there are some white

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,640
male longtime contributors who have been

00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:27,280
really active with this and have been

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,619
incredible allies and advocates and it

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,690
helps us so much when they are visibly

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:33,400
on our sort of team or whatever you want

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,690
to call it it's been that's been very

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,220
helpful so they've all did a great role

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,220
for allies to play there for sure

00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:48,609
hi I'm Molly I'm a human maybe part

00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:52,750
alien so you know um I just wanted to

00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:55,300
thank people for your work I recently

00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:59,230
actually had an incident and I had to

00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:01,119
sort of come to the channel and look for

00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,390
some guidance and some some support and

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,400
it was just really really amazing and I

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,349
really appreciated that so I wanted to

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,109
say that and I also wanted to sort of

00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:13,570
ask the question sort of posit sort of a

00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:15,220
comment around and the work you guys are

00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,710
doing a lot of it is online right if

00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:20,650
it's communication in a text-based

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:22,839
format online and I was just wondering

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:26,770
is there been any strategies you guys

00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:29,760
had around like this week DrupalCon are

00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:32,380
there things that one-on-one in-person

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,480
can be achieved that maybe you've been

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,030
we've been building up to with certain

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,520
interactions or are there things that we

00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,310
can do while we're here this week to

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,290
really help forward that I know you're

00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,180
going to talk about stuff in your allies

00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,730
talk or something maybe attentionally

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,680
but I was just wondering sort of we have

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,380
an opportunity here we're all in person

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,010
we're not necessarily in a chat room so

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:59,680
what can we do this week to really you

00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,589
know foster inclusion and togetherness

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,230
and unity and and look at everyone like

00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:07,330
the beautiful humans that we are and the

00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,790
work that we're doing and open source

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,410
and free software yeah that's a great

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,330
question I'll start

00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,760
we don't have like a specific you know

00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,800
there's no like do this one thing but we

00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,500
do have a table again generally hosted

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,030
by the Drupal Association and you can do

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,370
our humans as Drupal which is a very low

00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,320
bar ask of anybody but really want you

00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,450
all to come there I'll tell you all a

00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,600
funny story I think this was funny when

00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:34,940
we were planning this somebody so they

00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,620
hit me if not when we were planning our

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,240
the photobooth the humans is Drupal and

00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,170
the woman who is a mastermind of that

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,430
it's not even in the room but I really

00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:45,410
want to give a shout out to Alana

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:46,130
a lot of work amazing amazing work we

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,270
were like so we're going to get these

00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,490
pictures I'm going to post them online

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,990
and it's and it's we are Drupal as our

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,270
hashtags are we are Drupal and humans of

00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,920
Drupal and we were like what if a bunch

00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,390
of white men come and take their picture

00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,610
and it's like Basinger well bunch of

00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:01,730
white guys and we're like well that is

00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:04,190
Drupal in a certain way so we're like

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,900
well I guess you know and and as a

00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,580
matter of fact that has not been a

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,630
problem at the table we've had so many

00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,220
different kinds of people that I

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:12,430
actually have been actively reaching out

00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,900
to white people white men who walk by

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,950
because I'm like please come take your

00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,390
picture here so it doesn't look like

00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:20,210
we're just setting this up as a thing

00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,230
you know but so I'm telling you that to

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,580
tell you that all of you please come

00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,440
take your pictures and especially if

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,280
you're like oh I'm a white guy I'm not

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,960
who they're talking about

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,550
you are who we're talking about we want

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,430
your pictures in there too because again

00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:33,230
the whole point is the this is important

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,640
for all of us there's you know all those

00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,710
articles that are like diversity is good

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,330
for your bottom line it helps you think

00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,770
better and stuff like that the diversity

00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:42,710
on women's problem or people of color or

00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:44,390
queer or you know whatever problem it's

00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,760
everybody's problem and you can show

00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:48,500
that you're an ally by by coming to our

00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,910
booth and having your picture taken and

00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,770
saying yeah this is what I'm down with

00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,090
also and then you can retweet it when we

00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,100
post your picture and stuff like that

00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,630
and definitely do come to the Ally talk

00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,220
because again that's really what's been

00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,750
so helpful with people having allies so

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:05,090
far and there's tons more everybody can

00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:07,700
do I think something else just if you if

00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,140
you say okay well I can't do anything

00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,330
for the rest of the year I can be an

00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,320
ally while I'm a triple con I don't know

00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:16,130
why that would be true but if that's

00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,780
true makes direct eye contact with

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:21,650
people when you see them in the hallway

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,250
and smile at them especially if they

00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,570
look like

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,760
people you don't see all the time

00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:28,160
whatever that means to you right

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,410
literally just say hey how's your

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,760
morning good morning and that's really

00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,860
hard if you're introverted or have

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,120
social anxiety but that's one way that

00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,660
you can just make the space feel

00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,220
friendlier yeah thank you for that and I

00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,440
think that that's a great idea just if

00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:45,140
you see someone alone who looks like

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,420
they're a little bit lost or feels out

00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,770
of place just reaching out to them so

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:53,450
thank for that all right thank you guys

00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:55,250
thanks my hello thank you so much for

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,990
your work thank you for all you do and

00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,950
everybody in this room for being a part

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,920
of this conversation I think that's

00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:02,750
that's really huge to be proponents for

00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,810
more diversity and inclusion in Drupal

00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm Justin as a white Ishmael I'm

00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,040
interested in in not being part of a

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,510
problem anymore is there any resources

00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,940
that you could actively suggest or

00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:17,990
recommend come to atop Gunther besides

00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:24,590
Papa dating but we also have a resources

00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:28,550
page yeah University that our website is

00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,780
Drupal diversity comm and there's a

00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:32,330
resources section there where we've

00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,590
collected links and if anybody has great

00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:36,230
links about this stuff they want to

00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:37,640
share of like videos talks articles that

00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,310
help explain these things we do get a

00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,210
lot of requests from people just to like

00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,290
they're like okay I think you have a

00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,880
pretty good point how do I get my

00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,500
co-workers to understand this stuff like

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,770
that so come check out the resources

00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,770
page and send us other good ones yeah

00:48:54,490 --> 00:49:01,430
gender is over if you want it I also

00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,890
think coming to the slack meetings and

00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:06,170
even just observing I see so many good

00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:08,900
constructive behaviors modeled there

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:11,990
every week well actually 24/7 right now

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,670
but I just think it's a great way to get

00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:17,480
into the conversation and to hear what

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:21,830
people are concerned about and dip your

00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,200
toes in oh also if you want to help but

00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,830
are feeling weird and you are someone

00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,170
who feels really comfortable

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:30,020
contributing code and doing patches and

00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:31,340
that kind of stuff one way that you can

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,200
contribute is just to help us gather

00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,270
information put it out in a way that

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,780
makes sense that like organizational

00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:42,440
stuff

00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm really bad at hey I'm Chris my

00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,950
organization's digital bridge solutions

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,050
were sort of interested in improving the

00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:49,310
diversity of the Drupal community here

00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:51,560
we are actually doing an event tomorrow

00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,960
with Palantir we are bringing six

00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,900
students from organizations called

00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,630
empower they represent disadvantaged or

00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,770
underrepresented groups and we're going

00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,080
to bring them out to Drupal con we

00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,760
sponsored their tickets I think that's

00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:08,030
really cool I would encourage other

00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,160
folks attending but the same accounts we

00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,950
would love to make this bigger next year

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,270
instead of do six do like sixty so for

00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,520
instance being part of that I would love

00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,410
to talk to you about increasing

00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:26,480
representation of underrepresented

00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:27,800
groups at Drupal and in today's point if

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,570
there are ways you want to get involved

00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,970
but none of our ways work for you we can

00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:33,380
figure out ways it'll work for you right

00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:38,660
so that is another way that you can get

00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:41,300
involved hi I'm Michael I'm a

00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,450
cisgendered white male but I'm here

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,100
ready to go haha not it's not a but it's

00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,120
an end there's nothing wrong with being

00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,090
whoever you are

00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,530

00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,060
of all thanks again so much for

00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:57,770
everything you guys did you in like leg

00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:59,690
would you know it's it's so it's so it's

00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,930
unfortunate like like we're talking

00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,880
about that it's coming down to the kind

00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,620
of I guess you consider the like kind of

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,450
minority group like having to do most of

00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,370
the work so I think that's why we do

00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:13,040
need to encourage involvement I think

00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,840
just having this core conversation is so

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,390
helpful in that I think hopefully this

00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,880
will be some kind of standing seeing a

00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:24,320
triple cons going forward with the booth

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:27,140
but my question a conversation point

00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,440
would be going forward you know

00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,910
hopefully there's silver lining to this

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,070
controversy similar to you know the

00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,810
Trump election how that has spurred a

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:39,320
lot of political activity across the

00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:41,480
country a lot of engagement I think this

00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,740
similarly seems to be a great thing you

00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,080
know who would think that this would be

00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,700
such a full room you know people

00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,290
involved right now

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,060
and I'm thinking especially with Drupal

00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,310
8 being so much more integrated with the

00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,200
larger community now like everybody

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,430
we're tied in to so much more the PHP

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,119
community and beyond

00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:02,250
now that Drupal is opening up itself it

00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,829
seems like we can actually be a beacon

00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,470
to the rest of the kind of tech

00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:10,859
community in general as we open up our

00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:12,300
own API s and everything and so I'm

00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:14,220
curious if there's been conversations

00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,320
around that or like any kind of plans

00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,000
ahead of that you know how can we then

00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,250
even reach out beyond to further

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,230
communities and try to kind of spread

00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,849
this message encourage these kinds of

00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,700
conversations going forward in

00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:29,430
communities even beyond Drupal yeah

00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,230
that's a great question I think for me

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,970
personally again not speaking for the

00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,050
group for me personally I always feel

00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,460
like you know you should make sure your

00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,310
own house is clean before you go clean

00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,869
someone else's and so it would be great

00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,490
you know we do have this wonderful

00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:45,390
opportunity to affect change in

00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:47,040
governance in community culture and so

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,540
it's like well let's give it a year

00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,130
let's make some changes give it a year

00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,500
and if we make great changes I think

00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,430
other communities will pay attention we

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,800
have 10 minutes left

00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,960
thank you but but if you want to start

00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,480
talking about how do we do outreach now

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,609
let's go come to the dance come to the

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,040
music all right Damian hi Damian's

00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:12,720
human-alien but anyway um funny I'm

00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:15,660
running yes have you heard any positive

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,060
results yet of people who said like I

00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,130
was considering leaving but because

00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,990
there's so much theoretical hopeful

00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,940
momentum behind inclusion that they've

00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:29,849
decided to stick around longer only like

00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:31,410
one honestly yeah they might not be

00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:33,540
reporting to us I've talked to

00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,579
specifically with people who like I said

00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,560
were really really really angry and they

00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,869
felt very personally slighted by what

00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,319
had happened come into the channel and

00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:45,359
say okay well now I'm back to neutral

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:48,200
not hopeful but I'm back to zero and

00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,460
maybe I can get to hopeful in the future

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,470
but I haven't heard of anyone who's like

00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,089
I'm out and then totally change their

00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,839
mind I thought people are lobular

00:53:54,089 --> 00:54:02,130
cautiously often

00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:09,450
yeah hi I'm Eric I'm a human at his

00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:12,569
first DrupalCon and I think it's a great

00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:15,450
time to be on my first Drupal con and

00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:18,479
that is because of this idea of crisis

00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,920
is opportunity and I got to experience

00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:22,529
this in a couple of ways one very

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,509
personal but one very public in the form

00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:29,539
of I work if I could college and last

00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:32,880
and 2015 we had a diversity crisis and

00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:34,799
you know at a time it was seemed you

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,640
know to shake the foundations of our

00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:41,880
community

00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:45,739
what is the diversity crisis there were

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,640
there was a lot of racially charged

00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:50,819
issues I don't want to try to

00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,709
characterize that specifically because

00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:58,319
what I think it is important is that the

00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:59,849
community felt threatened by by division

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,069
that were around these kinds of issues

00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:05,339
and the response is what I want to point

00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:08,130
out because you know these things are

00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:10,650
very hard and they are they are long

00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:14,219
work and one of the most amazing things

00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:16,920
to me out of that process that has that

00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:20,670
emerge from that is people coming

00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,650
together to have conversations and doing

00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,880
this over time not just like okay we're

00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,829
going to have the public meeting we're

00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,930
going to have a conversation today but

00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:30,420
coming back week after week after week

00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,459
and I hear you talked about a slack

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,650
meeting that you have those kinds of

00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:38,339
conversations are the kinds of events

00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:40,499
that I have found in the process that we

00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:43,109
experienced are the most transformative

00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:45,209
you know showing up and starting to get

00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:49,440
other perspectives that take a lot of

00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:51,989
trying to get through so I want to

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,140
applaud you all for being in the thick

00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:58,709
of this and yeah I'm going to check out

00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:01,739
the weekly slack meeting it sounds like

00:55:58,709 --> 00:56:03,390
exists and would say people please be

00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:04,529
engaged in those kind of things you know

00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,240
if you can be doing those kind of things

00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:07,400
at

00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,380
Drupal meetups finding the ways to have

00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,150
these hard conversations to do it in

00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,920
person and be vulnerable and be open to

00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:17,540
connecting with people I think that's

00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:19,520
that's where you get thank you we are
