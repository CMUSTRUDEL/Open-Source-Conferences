Description: 
	It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the developer buzzwords that are constantly being thrown around and talked about. At the end of the day, no matter what library or framework helps you finish the project, it’s important to remember the basics.

We often forget, it’s the client’s happiness and their ability to carry on with their project after we step away that matters most. So how can we do our very best work so that our client’s are receiving a top notch website and not just a site filled with the latest and greatest libraries & frameworks. 

It’s easy - we get back to the basics.

Aesthetically pleasing design
Responsive, browser-friendly code
Version control the entire team can use
Excessive testing
Client-editable content wherever possible
Easy to manage deployment & devops process
Maintainable code after deployment
Documentation, documentation & more documentation
We all know that these things are important, but how do we do all of these things and still stay within the project budget? By creating best practices that you can follow over and over again.
