Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Back to the Basics: Best Practices for Front End Developers
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the developer buzzwords that are constantly being thrown around and talked about. At the end of the day, no matter what library or framework helps you finish the project, it’s important to remember the basics.

We often forget, it’s the client’s happiness and their ability to carry on with their project after we step away that matters most. So how can we do our very best work so that our client’s are receiving a top notch website and not just a site filled with the latest and greatest libraries & frameworks. 

It’s easy - we get back to the basics.

Aesthetically pleasing design
Responsive, browser-friendly code
Version control the entire team can use
Excessive testing
Client-editable content wherever possible
Easy to manage deployment & devops process
Maintainable code after deployment
Documentation, documentation & more documentation
We all know that these things are important, but how do we do all of these things and still stay within the project budget? By creating best practices that you can follow over and over again.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
I just want to prefix this with this is

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,370
my first Rubicon and I feel like I'm in

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,250
social heaven it is amazing

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,139
so thank you all for being here and for

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,610
attending my session as we're going to

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,350
talk back to the basics of front-end

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,550
development it's not gonna be a lot of

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,140
code stuff it's going to be a lot of

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,350
things that we don't think about because

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,170
we're too busy writing code so let's

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,640
just get started so my name is Tessa I

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,400
am an agency and community engineer at

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,320
Pantheon I am also an instructor for

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,719
girl develop it as well as an instructor

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,309
and director for kotas of tomorrow which

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,340
is a nonprofit organization that teaches

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,300
kids to code and I also love dogs I feel

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,590
like that's really important to mention

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,260
so I have 25 minutes to tell you

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,059
everything and that's not going to

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,910
happen so I've pulled out the things

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,230
that have felt very near and dear to my

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,309
heart in front-end development and the

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,449
things that I've started to learn

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,789
working with agencies and different

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:02,820
companies that have helped us become

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:05,489
successful there's so many things all of

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,760
the libraries how do you keep up I

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,380
definitely do not keep up so beyond all

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,850
of these things like what can we do to

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,509
make sure that our projects are actually

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,970
successful first ask designer and

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,490
developer collaboration it's really easy

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,880
as developers to see designers as our

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,890
anti friends and if we want to be

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,470
successful we need to see them as our

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,680
very close friends so it's a very

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,150
important thing to consider

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,680
so I actually implemented this process

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,470
at an agency that I worked at and it

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,150
ended up being insanely successful saved

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,909
us a lot of time saved us a lot on

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,860
budgets so I wanted to share it so we

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,689
started a design review process and what

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,180
that process was is that the developers

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,130
actually reviewed any wireframes and

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,689
design concepts before they went to the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,549
client as well as before they went to

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,200
the creative director that allowed us to

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,189
find things that were essentially

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,649
uncodable

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,890
or at least we can code everything but

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,299
do we want to code it like that so we

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,009
would discuss these wireframes that we'd

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,869
also compare them to the scope of work

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,119
so we had a budget that we were all

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,129
trying to stay within and looking at

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,720
that budget and being able to say hey is

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,340
this inside of budget or is this outside

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,870
of budget and be able to

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,879
is that before the client saw something

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,849
and essentially at that point we had to

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,769
do it and then we also reviewed our

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,269
coding decisions with them I know that

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,950
sounds brutal but if you're creating

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,150
like transitions or animations or

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,670
anything that has to do with the

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,349
aesthetic of the site they feel super

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,209
important if you actually involve them

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,810
in that decision and that helps build

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:40,170
that relationship so let's all be

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,700
friends outside of that like have social

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,739
hours I know it's easy to go have a

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,330
happy hour with your fellow developer

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,540
friends but try to include your designer

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,519
team as well offer to do a Lunch and

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,049
Learn on dev topics I actually did a

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,060
Lunch and Learn for my team on git

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,470
because they didn't understand like oh

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,250
why can't you just push it where it

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,049
needs to go it's not really that easy

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,000
but and the return if they actually did

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,500
a Lunch and Learn for us on some design

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,209
aesthetics on buttons that they really

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
enjoyed and like if they were codable

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,840
and how we could set up an actual

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,190
process or like a library that they

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,390
could essentially pick from when they

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,670
were working on design so an after hour

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:22,590
or after work happy hour solves all

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,150
problems right I feel like this one is

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,620
really tedious and I don't even know if

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,120
I should mention it but yet it is super

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,329
important because there's so many sites

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,069
that are not responsive so there's lots

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,269
of devices and they're all changing so

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,190
we need to make sure that we're not just

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,690
hitting those certain breakpoints but

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,280
that were actually like making them

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,019
responsive so that they are good for all

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,940
breakpoints and all of those crazy

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,709
devices doesn't always have to look the

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,380
same but it needs to function and this

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,000
also plays into the designer piece like

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,260
lay that out with your designers let

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,150
them know that it's like we might not be

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,099
able to perfectly match that design that

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,139
you have but as long as this functions

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,489
and that we can agree on this medium

00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,630
place then it's a safe place to be

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:04,250
installing Twitter bootstrap is not

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,250
going to make your site responsive oh

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,609
version control this is an important one

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:14,400
have you ever had this where you created

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,889
like or made some changes to a file and

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,359
then you uploaded it via FTP and you

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,799
broke your entire site and then you're

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,979
like I don't actually know what I did to

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,760
that file has happened to me more than

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,160
I'd like to admit so get this is a buzz

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,300
word and I'm trying to stay away from

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,340
other words that this is an important

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,170
one to free an open source distributed

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,180
version control system that allows you

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,440
to handle everything but ask you with

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,040
your large projects with speed and

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,740
efficiency so if you're new to get this

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,210
is a super great tool and I actually use

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,310
this for that lunch-and-learn that I did

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,540
with my designers we went through and

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,210
they literally were writing commands

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,160
based on what get was this get - Ettore

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,330
was telling them to do and it's super

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,620
great because it actually walks you

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,300
through all the different processes and

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,500
it's inside of command line so it also

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:04,250
kind of gives you that comfort level

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,390
with the command line and this is kind

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,860
of an example of what it would look like

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,720
in source tree if you're not a command

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,400
line person so you can see like in the

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,500
bottom corner whatever is green is what

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,240
was added to that file so instead of

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,640
changing the file and uploading it via

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,170
FTP you can control it and get and

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,540
actually see what was changed and know

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,930
like oh that broke my site I should

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,420
revert that piece of code so there's

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,910
github there's bitbucket and there's

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,050
Pantheon these are all places that you

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,480
can store your git repository while we

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,490
are on the topic of Pantheon I can't be

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,820
up here and not do a little bit of self

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,170
marketing it's important to find a

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,000
deadlocks workflow that works for you

00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,200
you know you might have servers that are

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,340
set up and you might have staging

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,419
environments when you're cloning all

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,880
these things all over the place and

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:52,220
having to replace databases there's

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,660
there's a better way and my friends down

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,760
at the Pantheon booth can tell you all

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:00,890
about that so has anyone done this like

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,360
you've copied over a file and put it

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,580
like from the server onto your computer

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,620
and then renamed it yep

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,930
show hands come on don't be bashful and

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,980
use that as your backup it's not a good

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,160
way to do it so this is a super obvious

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,690
one write good code actually we should

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,690
take some time to read this picture and

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,630
if you can't read it I can read it for

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,180
you but I don't have a moment basically

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,440
you should write code with the intention

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,090
that the next person that's going to use

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:38,479
it is a psychopath and they know where

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:40,770
you live avoid technical debt again this

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,110
kind of lays into the psychopath thing

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,330
any code that is written in a manner

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,580
that is difficult to work on in the

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,930
future is technical debt so ensure that

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,490
you are not being lazy the first time

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,620
code reviews you can ensure everyone is

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,120
following proper internal code standards

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,520
code reviews is something that I don't

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
think enough people are actually doing

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,090
have another developer review your code

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,770
you have no idea you might have been

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,090
putting something in a weird place and

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,710
they're going to be like hey this

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,630
doesn't make sense or maybe you could do

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,220
this and it's not even it's like don't

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,180
be shameful like just allow them to give

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,480
you that feedback we all make mistakes

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,950
let's find them before the client does

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,390
and what a better way to learn new

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,160
techniques than by reviewing other's

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,650
code I actually really enjoyed that at a

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,060
previous position of mine because I

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,350
would review ways that they were writing

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,570
the code that I would not even imagine

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,740
of doing them and it was really great to

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,710
see different techniques for writing

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,660
that code some really great tools for

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,060
code reviews is github the pull request

00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,830
process is super smooth probably my

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,570
favorite way to do them there's also

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,500
code break collaborate and get labs if

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,060
you're looking for other tools for that

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,760
comment your code I think this is a

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,140
super obvious one when you have to come

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,490
back to your code like two years later

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,040
and you're like I know I made like this

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,840
custom slider but what did I do

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,020
if you comment that that process will be

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,330
so much easier and just acknowledge that

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,980
we don't know at all there's always

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,810
someone that can help you grow and

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,100
become a better developer and for me

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,180
especially at the beginning I didn't

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,170
want to admit that I didn't know

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,150
something because I didn't wanna look

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,350
stupid I didn't want to look like the

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,480
developer that didn't know what it was

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,130
doing but I've come to realize that

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,930
other developers are super great and

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,540
they like want all of us to be super

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,770
great developers together so share that

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
like talk to other developers and

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,610
acknowledge that I don't know how to do

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,240
this I'm willing to figure out or listen

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,160
to what you have to say and if you have

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,020
a team if you're team leader encourage

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,120
your team to go to things like Drupal

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,640
con or other continuing education places

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,750
to help them grow as well it'll just be

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,570
an overall good fit for your team I'm

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,830
not a wizard accessibility but we should

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,480
definitely be considering this when

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,100
we're building websites you have no idea

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
what kind of disabilities your end user

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,350
are going to have and make sure that you

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,900
are considering these things

00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:01,990
writing code so this comes back to the

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,880
lazy thing I've had this happen don't be

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,570
lazy because the next time you come back

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:13,600
to that code you might be even lazier or

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:19,270
busier one of the two I like this

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,700
picture it's pretty fun testing there is

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,530
so much that I could mention with

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,960
testing so I'm really just going to kind

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,150
of cover the basics here but testing is

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,580
super important it's more important that

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,130
you find any issues before your clients

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,690
actually find them so there's nothing

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,240
worse than building the super great

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,680
feature and having Internet Explorer

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,940
literally smack you in the face

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,650
I built this like super awesome

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,000
responsive like a mega menu with Twitter

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,680
bootstrap which if you use bootstrap

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,070
it's actually quite difficult to like

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
edit their menu structure and it was

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,620
awesome

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,370
I opened in an Internet Explorer and it

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,230
was like non-functional not even working

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:03,690
so that was not fun so you should

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,520
definitely review your code as you did

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,870
um so there's lots of tools I'm Shirin

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,700
some of you know lots of other great

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,890
tools browser stat chrome dev tools

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,220
browser shots there's all lots of great

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,870
services Microsoft edge and I'm not a

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,490
Microsoft person but I was reading that

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,090
Microsoft edge actually has like some

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:25,090
pretty great tooling or testing in there

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,280
inside of their platform Xcode if you're

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,680
testing Apple devices and then like the

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,690
actual devices for me I find that to be

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,120
a really good reason to need like the

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,850
iPad and the iPhone and the MacBook and

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,460
the like gigantic iPad like I have to

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,690
test on all of them right you have to

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,310
buy them for me url fessing I think this

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,290
gets a lot of people and we don't even

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,790
realize that it should be a thing I

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,490
found the super awesome tool called

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,070
integrity it is for only Mac like Mac

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,140
users but it allows you to like look it

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,140
browses your entire site and then brings

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:03,400
back any URLs that are broken super

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,900
slick tool and b-hat I don't get into B

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,470
hat and it is a little bit or at least I

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,700
haven't dug into it much yet

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,320
and it a little bit deeper than

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,240
front-end development but I wanted to

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,700
mention this because my fellow Panthea

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,930
or Steve is actually doing a session on

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,250
this at 3:45 I think it's so 3:45 in

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,990
room 315

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,430
so if you're interested in further

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,450
testing you should definitely attend

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:30,090
this session so actually worked on a

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,680
website for so long you no longer see

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,750
the issues it's like when you're writing

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,950
a blog post and you're like keep reading

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,560
it and you don't realize that you say

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,420
like what what twice you just don't see

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,430
it it's just not there so have others

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,690
review your website client idle okay I

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,160
got like four minutes so I'm going to do

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,190
this really quick sorry guys I like to

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,900
talk so things to consider

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,420
you need to make anything that your

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,270
client is ever going to want to edit

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,950
actually editable we do not want to deal

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,120
with clients calling us like six months

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,450
later saying can you change my phone

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:08,580
number you can change it yourself if you

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,870
make it client editable I just love like

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,000
this story from the oatmeal have you

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,800
guys I read this where they like turn

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,860
the site into like this horrible

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,620
kiboshed like completely fluorescent

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,360
colored website this will happen if you

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,750
don't allow your clients the correct

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,350
amount of client and ability and

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,560
documentation documentation is huge yes

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,920
this is a really great meme right the

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,590
docs

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
sometimes they suck but if your client

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,620
can review those documents and actually

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,570
go into their website and change that

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,430
phone number themselves without calling

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,500
you that's going to save them time it's

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,360
going to save you time I know it's nice

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,620
to have that client that is going to

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,930
come back to you for that recurring

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,340
income but if you can alleviate some of

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,930
those pain points for them they're going

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,060
to have a more successful experience

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,530
with you don't tell anyone but I

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,010
actually write that I like writing

00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,810
documentation there's some tools for

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,280
documentation writing Google Docs that

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,020
one's really great if you insert like a

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,270
table of contents and use the headers

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,820
correctly it's a super slick tool for

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,830
that on Google Sites Google Sites like

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,170
just redid their platform and their new

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,760
platform is pretty awesome at last in

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,110
confluence wikispaces or any type of

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,050
wiki offerings are super great for

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,529
client documentation and I suggest that

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,420
if you're getting into this career

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,249
like a template that you can copy so

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,439
create all of the Drupal basics how to

00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:28,089
add all the different content and then

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:32,199
allow that to be your copy point for any

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,959
of your new client documentation your

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,610
client will destroy your masterpiece

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:40,809
allow them the information to wreck it

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:42,279
correctly that's all I had does anyone

00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:54,189
have any questions we only have like two

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:57,240
minutes but thank you thank you everyone

00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,240
