Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Using Machine Learning to Personalize Web Experiences
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	How might we personalize web content experiences based on subtle elements of a person’s digital persona?

Standard personalization mechanisms recommend content based on a user’s profile or past activity. Search for a shoe? Here are some more shoes. Read about celebrities? Maybe you would like this other article about celebrities! We can do better.  

Deep-Feeling is a proof-of-concept project that uses machine learning techniques to make better content recommendations to users. Using the Instagram API to access a user’s stream-of-consciousness, we’re filtering their feeds through a computer-vision API and using it to detect and learn subtle themes about the user's preferences.

Once we have an idea of the kind of experiences the user thinks are worth sharing, we then match the user’s characteristics against our own databases. In this proof-of-concept, we’re recommending travel experiences based on the kinds of things a person shares, using Acquia lift and Drupal 8. The applications of deep learning for content recommendation, however, are wide reaching and pretty awesome.

This is an intro session, no previous Drupal or machine learning background is required.

What you’ll learn:

How you can use machine learning to surprise and delight users
How a machine can make better recommendations than you could program yourself
How to apply emerging technologies to your current and future design challenges

very full room hi everybody so my name

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,980
is Charlie Moscow this is actually my

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:16,529
first triple con which I'm super excited

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,600
about so I work at my planet and I've

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,939
been working on Drupal projects for

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,529
about seven ish years now so I've been

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,119
benefiting from a lot of the work that

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,000
the Drupal community has put out and

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,929
I've I'm not actually a developer I've

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,669
been working in a product management

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,040
role so this has been my first

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,510
opportunity to actually contribute back

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,960
something that I've learned which is

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,050
pretty exciting for me so what I'm going

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,899
to run through with you is a piece of

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,460
conceptual work that my team has been

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,219
doing over the course of the last few

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,289
months that's very very cool where

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,140
essentially we have decided to look at

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,930
how we can apply some of the emerging AI

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,980
technologies in different ways in the

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,559
context of content-heavy websites like

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,640
the kind that I'm sure many of you built

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,010
specifically we're looking at are there

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,170
new interesting ways that we can learn

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,250
things about our users in order to

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,020
tailor their experience to their needs

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,159
so one way we're looking at doing that

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,090
is through recommendations so we're

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,430
going to try and build the world's

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,509
fanciest recommendation engine and the

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,210
main thing we're actually going to be

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,100
looking at today is how people make

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,020
decisions how people choose the kinds of

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,509
things they like how people choose the

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,329
kinds of things they need and how we as

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,060
people strike a balance between those

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,439
different things and we're going to be

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,570
looking at how we can use machine

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,030
learning both some off-the-shelf options

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,119
and some roll-your-own to deliver those

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,770
kinds of experiences to users so I'll

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,049
talk about what we did I'll then go

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,299
through why it's really hard and may not

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,380
work right now but could probably work

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,240
pretty soon and hopefully at the end of

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,310
this presentation you would have

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,140
basically a two to three week head start

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,770
over where you would be if you just

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,660
tried to pick this stuff up from scratch

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,940
so the case study I'll be walking you

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,770
through is a part of a series of case

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,140
studies we've been doing

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,310
and it is looking at how we can reduce

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,780
the burden of choice on on people in

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,650
terms of decisions that they're making

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,670
in this case fashion decisions we've

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,650
been trying this on a lot of different

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,680
kinds of decisions on decisions about

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,840
where to travel on decisions about where

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
to go to school I'm going to focus on

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,490
fashion and I'll get to why in just a

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,160
second but first little disclaimer not

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,800
really a drupal expert i've worked on a

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,600
lot of drupal projects but if any real

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,950
drupal questions come up throw them at

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,540
Jeff with the camera I'm also not really

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,340
a machine learning expert my educational

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,560
background is in developmental

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,120
psychology and computer science so I

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,920
definitely roll in those circles but

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,190
I've not been applying it heavily and

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,190
definitely not a fashion expert so we

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,370
were leaning on a lot of people with

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,180
expertise in industry for this project

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:18,270
not me so if I am NOT a fashion expert

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,670
why fashion for this particular case

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:25,410
study fashion is a really really cool

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:29,100
thing where it is primarily an emotional

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,540
choice where you see an article of

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,630
clothing and you make a decision about

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,370
whether you like it or not and that's

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,570
sort of your primary guidance on whether

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,490
or not you're going to go ahead and

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,260
purchase that thing price will play into

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,210
it size will play into it like with

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,780
anything there's a bunch of restricting

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,160
factors but it's primarily a means of

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,200
means of preferences more than

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,610
requirements which makes it a really

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,350
really interesting thing to try and

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,850
search for and a very interesting thing

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,710
to try and recommend it's also a thing

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,170
that people really struggle to describe

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,120
so this we talk to a lot of people who

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,670
do fashion recommendations in department

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,620
stores and in higher end boutiques as a

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,940
way to sort of suss this out it's very

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,060
difficult to get someone to describe

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,440
what they are actually asking for and a

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,810
lot of that is because fashion is very

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,170
relative what is formal to a developer

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,730
might be casual to a banker and also

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,830
it's very culturally relative for

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,150
different people of different ages and

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,980
different cultural backgrounds or into

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,380
very different things

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,390
and what makes it cool

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,450
is that apparel on the sort of sliding

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,340
scale in terms of how we make decisions

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,920
skews emotional but still with a bunch

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,820
of requirements thrown in so for example

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,730
in your shopping for something like

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,980
jewelry or entertainment music or video

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,840
products it's almost exclusively an

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,880
emotional decision where the users are

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,500
thinking about what they like or in some

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,530
cases what their significant other might

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,520
like at the far end of the spectrum on

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,470
the other side we have things like

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,570
insurance and education where you're

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,220
going to buy what suits your needs the

00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,870
best and then we have this wide scope of

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,780
things in the middle where users have

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,820
some wants and some needs and we're

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,460
going to try and fit those together so

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,500
apparel skews emotional but is very much

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,900
in the middle of the spectrum and some

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,850
fantastic recommendation work has

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,800
already been done kind of across the

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,510
board here where a lot of the big

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,960
players in the media industry have been

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,790
doing a lot of heavy lifting on emotion

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,740
based recommendations for a long time

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,060
Spotify is very good at figuring out

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,820
what your taste in music are and

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,020
recommending things Netflix has been

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,280
doing the same thing with video for a

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,110
long time and now they're really

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,550
cranking it up to the next level where

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,370
they're actually deciding what content

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,580
to produce based on what their viewers

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,230
would like and then Amazon has clearly

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,670
been able to show you products that are

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,740
like the things you need for a very long

00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,300
time we've done a lot of great work with

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,470
Drupal commerce historically on some of

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,630
our e-commerce tours and we're now

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,790
playing around with aqua a lift a lot

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,800
which is also showing a lot of promise

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,770
and the question for us now becomes four

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,330
things that sit in the middle where we

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,890
want to be able to recommend things that

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,990
a user will both like and that suits

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:08,480
their gamut of needs how do we do that

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,190
few more little last words on fashion

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,070
before I stop talking about it and start

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,080
talking about AI I promise we

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,720
interviewed a lot of people about how

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,880
they dress and most of the feedback we

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,440
got back was along these lines where

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,810
it's a representation of their self so

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,460
it's a very personal choice and there's

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,580
some additional complicating factors

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,210
that make this particular challenge a

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,150
lot of fun

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,310
one is that trends change over time so

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,350
something that may be very stylish today

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,419
may not be in the future so any sort of

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,760
learning model that we're building here

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,890
needs to evolve

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,470
over time as fashion senses do and as

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,720
trends come and go and as I mentioned

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,270
earlier the descriptors are relative so

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,010
what one person says is casual may not

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,710
be universally may not be universally

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,770
casual one person says his chic may not

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,120
be universally chic this last bullet

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,120
point that people want to stand out

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,490
while fitting in is actually sort of the

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,890
crux of how we managed to pull off some

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,280
of this AI implementation so if you look

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,750
at a user's digital persona all the

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,070
things they post online you could have

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,690
it you get a very good sense of who they

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,880
are you also get a very good sense of

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,490
the kinds of circles they roll in which

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,770
we can then use to learn a lot about

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,690
that person so are both with this

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,880
product with this project is we wanted

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,340
to see what we could do to gain a better

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,110
understanding of users preferences so by

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,300
looking at some portion of someone's

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,640
online persona the kinds of things they

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,710
post to assorted social medias what can

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,650
we learn about them and then we wanted

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,180
to provide some of our retail customers

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,130
ways to better serve their customer

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,080
needs to make better recommendations to

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,590
do things that might surprise or delight

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,300
their customers and the way we were

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,700
looking at doing this is by applying

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,590
some new AI tools and we sort of had two

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,210
tracks going at the same time so we were

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,130
rolling our own neural networks and

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,260
spinning up our own tensorflow instances

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,000
which was a bunch of fun but we also

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,550
decided that to accelerate the process

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,350
we would lean on some of the existing AI

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,270
tools out in the wild just to sort of

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,390
jumpstart the process and let us try

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,820
things without having to have a full

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,290
infrastructure already built out which

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,270
by the way I highly recommend to get

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,880
started with any of these platforms is a

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,470
couple hours two days of work and to get

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,700
them to start producing useful things is

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,950
also pretty quick although I will also

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,530
get to later why some of these are kind

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,220
of problematic in production especially

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,780
in an open-source context the reason why

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm talking about our fashion example

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,540
and we have a bunch of great ones is

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,190
there's actually a really incredible

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,010
data set that you can use to play with

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,430
this yourself Lou at all did some

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,910
fantastic work for the I Triple E Co CB

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:53,480
last year where they did some great pre

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,270
work on actually building out a fashion

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,920
identifier

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,290
so they've built some really incredible

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,210
tools that can look at a picture and

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:05,290
tell you what kinds of clothing are in

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:07,450
it they can for example tell the

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:12,180
difference between a maxi dress and a

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,380
romper which is something I can't do so

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,550
this went a long way and the most

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,080
important thing is that they then

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,240
decided to share their data set for

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,370
non-commercial uses so if you want an

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,170
awesome data set to play around with I

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,230
recommend these guys you can download

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,430
the whole thing oh edits it's pre tagged

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,130
which is really helpful as well so

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,600
they've put it through a bunch of their

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,760
learning already so you know what is in

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,980
each of those pictures so here's what we

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,440
were trying to do we wanted the user to

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,960
be able to state a goal like I am

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,390
looking for a dress then we wanted to

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,390
grab a social media input from them and

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,220
we tried a bunch so we would get access

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,170
to their Instagram feed or look at a

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,910
particular Pinterest board or get access

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,430
to some of their recent Facebook photos

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,350
we would then hit those images with a

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,940
computer vision AI so we're going to do

00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,440
some magic under the hood we tried a

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,510
bunch of different implementations that

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,250
I'll get to shortly and then magically

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,770
at the end it would spit out some

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:09,220
fashion recommendations and what we did

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,540
was essentially validated this with two

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,310
kinds of groups of people people who

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,720
would be shopping for fashion and see

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,830
whether or not they liked to what was

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,630
put it from the system and also with

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,980
people who do this for a living so is

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,250
this the kind of thing you would

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,990
recommend to this kind of person with

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,660
people whose job it is at a retail store

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,010
to make these kinds of recommendations

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,290
what we built ended up looking something

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,600
like this so the user would input a

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,550
statement they would then get prompted

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,650
to connect to one of an assortment of

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,260
social media feeds this is the Pinterest

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:44,140
one it's actually pretty easy to get

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,660
started with these api's both Instagram

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,670
and Pinterest make it relatively easy to

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,400
get at the users photos if you give them

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,320
the permission to do so if they give you

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,740
permission to do so

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,020
and then we had basically a set of 30 to

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,750
100 images per user and we're going to

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,600
try and recommend things for them to buy

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,810
based on things that they've uploaded

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,499
online in the past so how do we go about

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,589
doing that

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:13,959
tried three things with very varying

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,189
levels of success so the first thing we

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,189
wanted to try look something like this

00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:19,839
we would get the most recent 30 images

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,209
from someone's Instagram feed which is

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,089
what Instagram provides sort of their

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:29,769
standard API level access to we would

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:31,869
then run them through and a visual API

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,999
in this case we use the clarify API and

00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:36,609
it would give us back a series of tags

00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:39,999
we would then basically input those tags

00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:41,919
as a search into our existing series of

00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,689
products that we had for the user as if

00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,829
the user had searched themselves for

00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,899
those things and then we would spit out

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,719
the recommendations to the user here are

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,179
some things that you can buy here's what

00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:55,869
that looks like so these results are

00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,309
from clarify which tends to be sort of

00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,489
the current frontrunner in terms of

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:03,849
these things there's actually a great

00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:05,799
see if I can pull this up here there's

00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:09,819
some great comparison work that's been

00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,529
done on sort of all of the different API

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:14,049
s and who has the best outputs it's

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,389
extremely variable for different kinds

00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:20,499
of visual recognition where's my Corgi I

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:23,589
like that one there's a collie it's

00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:26,199
pretty good so this compares recognition

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:29,499
Microsoft's open API IBM's Watson API

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,729
Google View cloud site and clarify and

00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,529
depending on the kind of thing you're

00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:35,409
going for it's sort of variable who has

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,389
the best data set kind of based on who

00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:39,159
has used that API historically because

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,289
these things are learning as users

00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,239
upload images so whoever's uploaded the

00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:47,259
most images whoever's had the most

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:49,599
images uploaded is the best so that is

00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,309
the we decided to go with we tried a

00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:54,069
bunch but we decided to go with clarify

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,979
for this tagging process and even with

00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:58,899
the best of the bunch on this image as

00:12:56,979 --> 00:13:01,479
an example with the clarify API spat

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:04,689
back to us was fashion urban City Auto

00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:06,279
woman sunglasses sweater which is a

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:09,849
pretty good description of what's in

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,919
that photo but functionally useless in

00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:13,569
terms of making recommendations the fact

00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,039
that someone has bought a sweater does

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,959
not mean that they will buy another

00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,089
sweater and it definitely does not mean

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,979
that out of our series of eight hundred

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,149
thousand images of sweaters we can pick

00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:25,370
the right one

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:28,520
it's time to try something else

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,180
so another service that a lot of these

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,000
public ap is offer is the ability to do

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,730
direct image to image visual comparison

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,800
so you feed it an image and it gives you

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,620
an image with similar characteristics

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,330
from your data set along with how

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,440
similar it believes those images to be

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,089
disclaimer we didn't think this would

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,459
work going in it sounds like a pretty

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,070
bad idea but we wanted to try it anyway

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:58,610
and here is basically what you come back

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,020
with so you can see how there are

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,970
similarities in these images they're

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:07,040
both people they're both wearing white

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,779
and beige but beyond that if you were to

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,690
actually try and make recommendations

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,690
based on the output from this sort of

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:17,630
simple untrained what you get back from

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:21,010
IBM without any qualification also not

00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,910
useful so then a designer on our team

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:27,500
showed me something really interesting

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:30,709
so this is a British millennial fashion

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,650
juggernaut Topshop and they have built a

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,480
style quiz on their website which is

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,360
basically attempting to get the users of

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,770
their site to decide to describe what

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,630
kind of thing they're looking for on

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,880
this page you basically say whether

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:49,160
you're more of a Beyonce posh glam style

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:52,279
or a Florence Welch eccentric cool look

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:57,380
I think we can all agree that I am a

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:59,150
Beyonce so we decided maybe there's a

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,730
way to do this without having to have

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,810
the user automatically define themselves

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,029
and what we came up with was something

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,740
like this so we were going to pull a

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,020
user's Pinterest feed that one actually

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,390
came from feedback from people we were

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,740
testing these things with who said you

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,540
know my Instagram really has a lot of

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,740
personal stuff on it I may not want to

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,380
share that with you but I have this

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,329
Pinterest feed of dresses I really like

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,339
maybe you can look at that and then make

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,470
a dress suggestion that sounded like a

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,779
good idea so we went with that we then

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,180
did a visual pre-screen for noise so we

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,490
hit basically every image with the

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,740
clarify API once and only processed

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,310
images that had people or clothing in

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,660
the

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,520
which is something that these api's are

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,890
really good at telling you and then we

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,560
did a visual corpus comparison to make

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,690
recommendations so here's where it gets

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,760
fun we had our big data set of images

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,440
some of them were pre tagged and what we

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,110
essentially did was we started to build

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,210
up knowledge of some fashion terms and

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,010
descriptors that can apply to specific

00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:01,310
kinds of entities so we tried to

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:04,040
basically teach the Watson API what

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,110
Cheikh looks like and what glamorous

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,450
looks like and what sporty looks like

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,240
and we had about 30 of these descriptors

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,790
which we had enough of a data set going

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,220
in that we could hit the API and sort of

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,740
teach what kind of thing we were going

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,660
for and what that does is the design

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,580
sure is it essentially builds up a

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,040
corpus of knowledge around what a

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:29,870
specific kind of pattern is we get back

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,600
to creepy cats again which is always fun

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,120
this is sort of a famous image from 2013

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,580
where Google decided to have its visual

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,700
engine visual recognition engine sort of

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,620
spit back out what it had learned this

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,820
is what Google thinks a cat looks like

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:49,460
this is the prototypical corpus cat you

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,290
can see it looks kind of cat-like maybe

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,420
but this is sort of the visual

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,630
representation of cat and what we did

00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:00,080
was essentially train the Watson API on

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,020
what a visual depiction of several

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,220
different kinds of fashion were we then

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,530
validated those with some scraping of

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,079
some social media sites so our idea of

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,380
what was glamorous basically matched

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,670
what people on Instagram had tagged with

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,620
glamorous in the last few months and

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,780
that sort of thing and then we were

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,819
ready to try and use that based on these

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,380
Pinterest inputs to make some

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:27,170
suggestions and here's how this tends to

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,990
work so we I've been Watson has a

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,820
similarity beta which is a visual API

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,130
that they're getting close to publishing

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,470
which does basically exactly this you

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,900
train it up on separate corpuses of

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,230
knowledge and then you give it a new

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,090
series of photos it compares Series A

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,610
with Series B and tells you how similar

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,920
those photos you uploaded are two

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,600
different entities

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,030
from your preset series of knowledge so

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,280
in this case we bet in just a single

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,830
image to make it a bit clearer what was

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,680
going on but what we got back is from

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,140
this one image you can see that this is

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,340
considered primarily casual fashion with

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,550
elements of sporty chic and classic I

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,710
probably could have told you that a bit

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,540
where you can see it's a semi casual

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,300
dress she has the sporty shoes going on

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,160
the sweater might be a bit of a classic

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,850
look we did test these sorts of

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,650
input-output chains with people who

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,510
worked in department stores and also

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,100
with some friends who we had who we

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,350
thought were just relatively fashionable

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,610
people and the descriptors came back

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,270
pretty good so what we have here is

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,700
actually at least nominally functional

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,290
to the point where we can use this as

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,280
the basis to start making

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,690
recommendations so if we compare what

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,300
different articles of clothing within

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,790
the the store we're working with or

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,170
selling look like and compare sort of

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,050
how they line up with these indicators

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:56,710
to the inputs from a social media feed

00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,400
we can start to make pretty useful

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,140
predictions and also interestingly

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,690
predict things that a user may not have

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,860
thought they wanted so this is where

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,350
we're starting to bring back a little

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,880
bit of the human touch to these

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,290
recommendations that you can get in a

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,360
store where someone goes well if you

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:16,060
like that sort of thing maybe you'll

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,030
like this kind of item even if it wasn't

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,150
directly what that person was asking for

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,350
so this is really cool and we've now

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,300
been putting this in front of some of

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,040
the the commerce merchants who we work

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,050
with and asking if they would like this

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,610
sort of thing and the response has been

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:35,230
relatively positive so to run through

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,140
what we learned so you don't have to

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,920
learn it yourselves there's some good

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,510
news and some bad news

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,970
so these api's are pretty awesome you

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,740
can as opposed to spinning up your own

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,300
neural networks on your own hardware or

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,070
buying some pretty expensive cloud

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,440
hardware to do all this processing for

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,240
you hit some of these public api's to

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,000
validate the concepts and then either

00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,260
keep using them or do it yourself

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,330
subsequently the the barrier entry on

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,050
this is really low there are a lot of

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,920
pretty nice

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:08,980
JSON API so as long as you can feed in

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,720
JSON and images and deal with JSON

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,710
coming back at you you should be good to

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,390
go it's really good to validate these

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,770
concepts and another important one and

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,010
this is sort of the classic machine

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,660
learning learning is that the further

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,370
away you move from something that's

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,890
human readable the better the results

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,270
tend to be so when we were asking for

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,190
tags back from the machine where we

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,990
could see what was being searched for it

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,850
didn't work so well when we let the

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,530
visual the visual algorithms more just

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,970
do their thing we tended to get

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,710
significantly better results so some bad

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,200
news which would make this application

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:49,540
not super useful in a lot of actual

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,550
production deployments in fashion a lot

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,170
of people do their selection by merchant

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,090
as opposed to buy items so people choose

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,900
where they're going to shop as a way

00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,310
that matches their personality versus

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,130
the actual items that they're picking in

00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,620
stores so this could almost be a good

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,180
tool for a fashion store recommender as

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,980
opposed to a fashion item recommender

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,810
the biggest barrier to deploying

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,340
something like this in the wild is that

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,980
if you're going to use social media

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,810
images as an input they're quite

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,210
accessible but the terms on them are

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,550
quite restrictive and on the flip side

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,130
if you're using these public machine

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,020
learning api's the terms tend to be

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,460
pretty open in terms of what those

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,860
services can do with the images that

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,150
you've uploaded so there's there's a

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,830
pretty significant legal challenge in

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,720
terms of pairing up the source of the

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,640
images that you're using with whatever

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,650
you're using to do the processing if you

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,970
roll your own that's less of a problem

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,730
but you still have to make sure that

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,520
you're compliant with all of these

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:51,250
social media api's and some of them are

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,840
intentionally restrictive because this

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,820
is the kind of thing that a Pinterest

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,260
for example wants to be able to do

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,060
themselves and they need to maintain

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,640
their strategic advantage so a lot of

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,610
times are kind of hard to get at this

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,140
stuff is still expensive today so to hit

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,970
these public api's you're looking at

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,740
anywhere from half a cent to five cents

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,940
per call and that really adds up both in

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,440
the training stage when you're hitting

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,820
it with hundreds of thousands of images

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,310
to build up corpus

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,230
knowledge but then also on the learning

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,470
side if you have to feed many images in

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,450
it's expensive to get it's expensive per

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,250
user where you're looking at cents per

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,420
user to run the system so you need to

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,450
have a pretty good return in order to

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,760
make it work if you roll your own it's

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,830
also still expensive because at this

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,170
point that typically involves powering

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,350
some GPUs one night we accidentally left

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,570
an AWS GPU running all night and came

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,970
back like a $600 bill in the morning

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,070
just for the one computer so right now

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,770
the costs are high but with Moore's law

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,060
they should come down we hope and then

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,110
we'd be able to do these things all the

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,730
time

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,730
and there's also a significant challenge

00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,340
right now making these sorts of systems

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,440
mess mesh with an open-source mentality

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,810
where a lot of image data is very

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,370
closely protected both by the producers

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,080
of that information and also by the

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,890
different repositories where it's stored

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,040
and there isn't really a concept of open

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,560
data today so there aren't really

00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,090
collaborative pools that we can use for

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,430
training like we couldn't actually

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,690
deploy this directly into production

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,690
because our data set had a strictly

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,130
non-commercial license on it so you're

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,320
either working with someone who has a

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,580
big pool of data already like a fashion

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,070
retailer with a whole bunch of tagged

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,780
images or we need some way to

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:39,400
collaboratively source these things

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,050
which is more difficult so key advice

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,210
you have to sort of trust the systems

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,770
the more you try and monitor them the

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,370
harder it is to actually get anything

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,710
back and things for all of you to pick

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,530
up if you're interested one thing we're

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,720
looking at is sort of living corpuses of

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,060
knowledge so things that evolve over

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,490
time where our definition of what is

00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,980
stylish may be different in two years

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,810
than it is now ways we've looked at

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,200
adapting that or either datasets that

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:11,080
change over time or potentially matching

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,150
a user's input to a real live human with

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,720
similar taste some kind of taste maker

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,940
where we could then pull their results

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,590
another big next step is machine only

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,020
trends in patterns so right now we try

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,290
to teach it some human classifiers of

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,320
fashion

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,640
things like chic and sporty those

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,240
probably don't mean much so it's

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,100
possible that if we instead let a smart

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,900
deep learning system pull out trends on

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,970
its own it could potentially make even

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,690
better recommendations even though we

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,680
would understand them less and a big one

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,690
with all these things is sort of

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,670
reducing the the ick factor where a lot

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,820
of people still want a human touch in

00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,080
their sales systems and will need to

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,120
work on that along with the

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,390
collaborative data set piece so this was

00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,400
a bunch of fun I learned a lot and I

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,400
hope you learned a bit too so thank you

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:14,030
and I think we do have a few minutes for

00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:14,630
questions if anyone has questions looks

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,010
like we're good

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,010
