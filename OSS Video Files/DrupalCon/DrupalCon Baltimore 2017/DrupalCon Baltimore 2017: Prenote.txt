Description: 
	Balti-more Prenote: the Balti-most Fun at DrupalCon!

The Prenote!
Don't miss it! 8 a.m. Tuesday! Get a good seat for Dries's keynote!
A DrupalCon institution, Robert and jam's opening "Prenote" has been getting people out of bed early and excited about DrupalCon since 2010. What's not to like about an infotainment extravaganza featuring Drupal community stars and friends; music and sing-a-longs; bad jokes; technical tutorials on Git, yodelling, use of the alphabet, or proper beer pouring technique? Especially eye-opening if you've never been to DrupalCon or never gotten up early enough to see one of these yet.

Dries says "Be there."
After his Keynote address at DrupalCon Portland, Dries revealed who is his favorite community speakers are, "Actually, I love the session before my keynote by Robert Douglass and jam. It's just hilarious. It's not a very technical session, but it is really, really awesome. I mean, I was watching it and I was laughing all the time."


Come along to get solid practical advice about Drupal, DrupalCon, and how to thrive as a member of the Drupal community ... and come to the Prenote, too! :-D


"Rob and jam put their special twist on the meaning of DrupalCon. It's been a fun-filled – and useful – surprise every time. If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it. And hey, at least you'll get better seats for my keynote right after." - Dries

low bass voice this morning to get

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,390
started you might or might not be aware

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,850
that our community's been going through

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
a rough time recently I've personally

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,160
lost a lot of sleep in the last month um

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,050
many of us involved in the pre note have

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,489
been consumed by stress and fears and

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,820
and have seen people that we know and

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,239
respect caught up on all sides of recent

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,160
events Campbell and I thought long and

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,650
hard about how to do a prenup this time

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,930
around and you know that the challenges

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,840
to our community to our values of

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,700
structures or practices it meant that we

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,270
couldn't just get up here looking

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,979
fantastic in spandex as usual you can't

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,820
just dance your silly way until yet

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,210
another DrupalCon

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,630
in this kind of an environment but our

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,070
answer part of our answer was I

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,979
published two blog posts called Drupal

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,670
I'm taking sides where basically say I

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,119
say that this community is worth

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,420
everything to me and I posted another

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,250
post about deciding what values we

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,869
really believe in and how we can then

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,850
live those and for me I posted about how

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,310
important something like the pre note is

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,950
as a reminder to all of us of the things

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,110
that we do all value together no matter

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,390
what else is going on there's a lot here

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,219
that we all love and believe in so we we

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,710
should remember that you know we've put

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,409
15 or more years of hard work into this

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,479
and we enable people around the world to

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,509
work and make a living and communicate

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,030
and simply make a difference online and

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,420
in

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,900
real-world to what we do actually does

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,810
make the world a better place so we can

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,280
and we should pick ourselves up dust

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,440
ourselves off figure out how to do

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,340
things better next time and fix things

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,160
so one of the things that Campbell and I

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,980
cherish the most is DrupalCon it's one

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,660
of our community's treasures and the pre

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,040
note that we've come up with this time

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,319
celebrates a lot of the things that we

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,750
love about our community by looking at

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,630
this very institution that has been

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,250

also when I started preparing for this

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,100
presentation I figured you know maybe

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:55,009
not all that much has changed over the

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,500
past couple of months all right so let's

00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,840
get started equal noise we only release

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,990
the bull nose a month ago so we worked

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,479
on Drupal now for more than one year and

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,690
if you look at a statistics you see that

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,000
compared to Drupal 8 people not many

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,669
more contributors almost twice as many

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,699
from four hundred seventy something new

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:19,669
for a seven hundred forty and as well as

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,229
in terms of patches we have almost nine

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,849
that we have nine thousand four hundred

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:28,250
and twenty five batches triple das has

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,590
many more features so for example forums

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,599
are actually now a little bit more

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,209
powerful where we can import moderators

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,490
which we all try to open ID which

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:39,380
they're known to be a great move we also

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:45,440
added things like actions and triggers

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:53,750
we added an installer everybody we have

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:56,589
sticky table headers the old nowadays is

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,589

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:22,120
I am the very model looker - Poulos

developer I published woven hats abyss

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,210
with every core contributor I know the

00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,010
seven function stack I've got in my

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,770
memories altered forms to entity so

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,480
those are elementary a very well

on foreign keys and joins them using PHP

00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,060
while launching sites I say how loud

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,710
your code deserves to see the cloud

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,820
where scaling is commodity and packets

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:08,220
come for almost free

this all about a website eat some

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,360
modules to get to lots of visit towards

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,650
the tasks that dress makes trivial but

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,450
make sure you have some ofourse and

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,950
teaming is a simple test with CSS and

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,360
javascript but easy says you should not

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,360
use the entity construction kit

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,370
now if you want some firm advice you

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,860
need not ask me even twice I'll give it

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:17,120
to you at half price because I could

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:20,059
tell you're rather nice a warning stems

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,980
from ancient lore that junior devs

00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:29,000
should not ignore the wrath of Greece

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:31,330
watch much more be falsely shut you hack

appears with every core contributor I

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,640
know the seven functions stack I've got

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,020
it in my memory from altered forms to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,020
entity so those are elementary

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:12,930
I feel like I really got a lot out of

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,470

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:31,620
there's a mentor Once Upon a midnight

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:34,049
dreary while sty programmed weak and

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,220
weary working on a quaint and curious

00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:40,320
website with its own web store whilst I

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,470
coded keys are tapping I found myself

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,539
considering hacking hacking just one

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:50,100
line I thought I'd never have to answer

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:54,210
for on my IRC there came a DM I could

00:29:50,100 --> 00:30:01,049
not ignore quoth the mentor don't hack

00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:05,070
core does he always talk like that it's

00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:07,259
either that or in song this is a huge

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:14,250
improvement though at least he's not

00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:18,720

easy way to start the day a simple

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,539
little issue that was perfect for him

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:29,700

00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:34,649
problem excuse me

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:43,280
wait-wait-wait-wait we tweet so this is

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,480
where my flight notes ran out

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,630
aha this is where we're supposed to

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,030
break into song one more time and send

00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,300
everyone out to enjoy their con but

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,980
before we do that we want to reiterate

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,020
the things that we said at the beginning

00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,630
of the pre note cuz we noticed some of

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:04,830
you weren't here very briefly the Drupal

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,350
community is in the middle of a

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,240
transformational crisis right now we're

00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,550
reading our fundamental values and how

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,890
our structures support them we're asking

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:16,920
difficult questions and finding common

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,020
answers we believe we believe that part

00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,690
of the reason this is so hard is because

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,609
we all care so deeply about this

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,800
community and the software we've built

00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:28,050
creating the pre note as silly as it is

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,930
is our way to celebrate the things that

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:36,359
we all of us here love about this place

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:38,310
these people and this community and this

00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:42,510
power chord it's extremely important

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:46,080
right now so let's celebrate this thing

00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:49,470
that we love together so and now for

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,880
