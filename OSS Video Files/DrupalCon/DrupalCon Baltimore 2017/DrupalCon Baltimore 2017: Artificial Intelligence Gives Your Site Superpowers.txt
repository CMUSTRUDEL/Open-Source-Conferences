Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Artificial Intelligence Gives Your Site Superpowers
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Drupal's core feature as a CMS is the collection and organization of content. It's been said that Data is the "fuel" for the latest machine learning (ML) techniques called "Deep Learning" and "Neural Networks". It turns out that Drupal's structured content is exactly the type of fuel these techniques need to learn useful patterns and provide state of the art functionality that wasn't even possible 5 years ago.

The audience for this talk should be interested in machine learning and it's applications, but no coding background is necessary.  You will learn how to look at your data from the perspective of an ML engineer. You will also discover how you can leverage Deep Learning and your own site content to give Drupal superpowers by using the same technology that's exploding at Facebook, Google, and Amazon.

We will cover:

What is Deep Learning?
What types of problems is Deep Learning good at and how reliable is it?
How to mine your Drupal content as the fuel for Deep Learning.
When should you use existing ML models or services and when should you create your own?
How do you deploy these ML models and use them in production?
Alternatives to training your own. Writing your own classifier isn't that hard, but it can be prohibitive for those without an ML background or compute resources. Luckily, there are solutions for implementing existing ML applications to analyze your site's data, even if you don't have any ML experience. We will demonstate some alternatives using free pre-built models and paid services from Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and others.
Use a Drag and Drop interface to create, train, and deploy a simple ML model to the cloud using the Microsoft Azure ML API
Use Google Speech API to turn spoken audio into text for use with chatbots and virtual assitants.
Sentiment Analysis (i.e. are reviews positive or negative) using the Watson REST API
Uploaded images can add Face, Logo, and Object detection using the Google Vision API module
Automatically creating summaries from node content using Microsoft's ML API

so this talk is how AI gives your

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,050
project superpowers as written as gives

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,310
your site superpowers but you know being

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,109
that we're all digital experience

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,480
creators now not just website creators

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,760
this seemed like a better title a quick

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,019
reminder code Sprint's around Friday if

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,010
you haven't participated you're

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,480
interested in participating more in the

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,239
Drupal community this is a great way to

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,270
get some kind of hands-on help get your

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,530
first core contributed patch over the

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,059
week so I'm Frank Carey I'm the CEO of

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,040
Healy core all those business cards you

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,190
got around his company that partnered

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,110
with I've been a Drupal is for 10 years

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,840
so I've been around the block seeing how

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,360
Drupal and the web has changed over the

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,199
last 10 years quite a bit it's crazy to

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,180
think like 10 years ago was right around

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,039
the time I don't think that the iPhone

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,500
was debuted just yet but feels a little

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,030
bit later in the year so 10 years ago

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,320
there was no iPhone something think

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,260
about so 2007 was interesting but 2012

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,320
was a big year too you guys might

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,640
remember this this movie I don't never

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,759
saw it I think it was terrible

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,640
but the whole idea was that in 2012 the

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,049
Mayan calendar was running out and it

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,400
was going to be some sort of apocalypse

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,380
people started taking this pretty

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,579
seriously I remember there were some

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,070
things in the subway of like you know

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,759
come join our cult so 2012 was a big

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,159
year for me

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,650
I left my position lucrative position at

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,079
Sony Music to go back to school get a

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,979
degree in machine learning in AI and in

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,540
the middle of my grad program the

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,659
there's a program called imagenet it's a

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,450
competition where different researchers

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,360
try to best each other by taking

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,939
millions of images across thousands of

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,660
categories categories like different

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,970
types of dogs cats bottled beer and

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,619
[Music]

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,480
classifying them correctly using

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,150
whatever technique they want but

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,910
generally machine learning

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,910
so it was big about 2012 was previously

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,460
people were using hand coded techniques

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,900
techniques were used to where you go in

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,670
and you write some if-else statements

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,310
I'm exaggerating a little bit but that's

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,050
basically what they were doing and this

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,860
was a body of work that was going on

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,870
since the 50s

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,170
to figure out what image features to use

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,459
how to segment them and things like that

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,020
but at the end of the day effectively

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,150
was not machine learning but it was more

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,709
statistics they knew how to cut these

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,030
things up and they'd show them what

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,470
worked over time but is sort of human

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,840
labour figuring these things out not

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,330
machines and then in 2012 the winner

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,750
dropped this is the error rate on the

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,280
left hand side the winner dropped the

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,450
error rate significantly so this have

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,459
been going on a few years prior to this

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,930
and things were kind of plateauing you

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,709
know humans were only able to improve

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,150
this thing so much in 2012

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,410
everything you see in purple is this new

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,660
method new method was called deep

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,480
learning how many people have not heard

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,480
of deep learning okay

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,280
so deep learning is a new methodology

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,930
that uses the uses of it's inspired by

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,820
the brain let's say it's not using

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,200
neurons but it's inspired by the way the

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,900
brain works or the little bit we know

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,100
about it and it's a technique in machine

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,810
learning that allows us to deal with

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,430
very let's say noisy difficult problems

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,769
that have some sort of hierarchy and

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,440
it's proved to be very effective so in

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,900
this case 2012 you can see how much the

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,450
rate dropped it dropped from around what

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,400
30 percent down to 15 percent and then

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,110
each subsequent year including now it

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,680
keeps dropping what you'll notice is

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,079
that the human performance is in red so

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,340
once we become superhuman at this task

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,350
and some of these tasks are Hardware

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,030
it's like you know different types of

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,730
dogs I'm a dog lover but I don't know

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,170
all these different types of dogs the AI

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,730
was able to correctly predict you know

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,670
the difference between a poodle and a

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,230
dots under something like that so it

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,680
continues to be better so these I would

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,120
say are superpowers that we're gaining

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,430
when it's better than human it's say a

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,680
human superpower but even if it's not a

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,570
human and it's just a machine I think of

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,690
these as superpowers because even if

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,730
it's not as good as a human at the task

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,720
still can alleviate a lot of work that

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,680
the humans would have had to do

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,100
otherwise so what are these superpowers

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,360
that I'm talking about so one thing to

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,910
keep in mind is that you may already be

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,410
using machine learning right now and the

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,910
goal of my talk is to say hey we should

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,990
be exploring these things you should be

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,190
interested in these things because

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,410
they're going to become tools you're

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,150
going to be using very soon but you may

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,250
argue most of you how many are familiar

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,260
with this logo

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,780
so it's malam right malam uses machine

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,930
learning behind the scenes to figure out

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,480
what's PAML it's ham and it does it

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,120
pretty effectively and it learns over

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,120
time so just the idea that you're you

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,870
may already be using some these tools so

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,000
some of these superpowers you could

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,940
categorize into large swath like

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,080
interpreting images or categorizing

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,510
images like we talked about with image

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,860
net natural language processing so if

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,390
you're working on some sort of box and

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,190
you want people to ask a natural

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,420
question they may ask it in a few

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,490
different ways and you want to be able

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,550
to figure out what what are they really

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,669
asking for it being able to listen so

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,310
right now Google has technology where

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:37,960
for the hearing-impaired I could speak

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,790
it could start typing and people could

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,370
people use that red way speaking it can

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,169
generate speech so you've used a Garmin

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,570
or something you know Google Maps and

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,940
the person speaking that technology is

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,580
getting much much much much better than

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,560
it was just a few years ago and then

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,350
translating the traditional way Google's

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,240
translating was taking two pieces of

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,830
text that had been translated by humans

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,930
and just sort of mapping them one-to-one

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,210
roughly what the new techniques are

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,990
doing that we'll get into in a minute is

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,910
using deep learning to actually

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,040
translate and end so it's able to

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,680
translate between languages that it

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,970
didn't have examples for so maybe going

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,650
from like I don't know Swahili to

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,930
Hungarian or maybe that's like a very

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,430
uncommon pairing but now it's able to do

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,330
that because it's sort of like learning

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,070
a meta language in between and then

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,450
content creation and augmentation I

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,770
think this is a really exciting space

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,210
accessory for the Drupal world because

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,090
we sort of live with content all the

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,770
time that you know we're used to like

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,450
user-generated content but what about AI

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,640
generated content things like that so

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,440
we'll explore all these

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:47,430
so how do we create this this

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:48,840
Frankenstein monster so we're going to

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,040
keep it very simple we're not going to

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,180
dive in if you want to dive in please

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,160
come to the box we'll talk a little bit

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,900
more in detail but basically what you

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,020
want is you need to collect some data

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,210
and what you want is label data meaning

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,030
that you have sort of here's a bunch of

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,860
images say an image net here's what the

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,810
right category is for that image so you

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,460
sort of leave this pair right the input

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,650
data that you want to end up being able

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,180
to predict in the future and the correct

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,650
label that is supposed to be labeled and

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,420
when you have the correct labels you can

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,890
know when it when the model goes and

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,360
predict something that are predicted it

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,280
incorrectly and you can say how

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,690
incorrectly did it creates it and that's

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,490
how it's learning it's learning based on

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,720
just like a child saying you know this

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,620
is a cat and this is a dog right and

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
Drupal is great at this because it has

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,460
all the structured data so in this case

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,350
we've got a set of taxonomy tags so this

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,640
is a great example where you could maybe

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:43,350
have a site that exists where you let's

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,490
say it's a articles news articles and

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,950
they're supposed to go in some app

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,870
category on your site you can use the

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,520
existing data on your site the more data

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,380
you have the better or you can use the

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,480
existing data on your site to actually

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,520
predict in the future when someone say

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,300
creates a new article what is that

00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,830
article

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,900
supposed to be tagged with so you can

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,900
recommend tags that they should consider

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,030
for instance so Drupal is really good at

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,590
having this data in a structure that we

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,480
can export and you may export it through

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,920
like a sequel query or something like

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,420
that to get it out into a format that

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,450
you can use the process by a some other

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,070
system so you take these two sets the

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,280
data write your X's your inputs and why

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,960
is that what are the correct outputs you

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,490
put it into a model right and this is

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,250
where black boxing and I'm not going to

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,020
get into details but you put it into the

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,550
model and you do this basically over and

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,950
over and over again and the model just

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,630
like a toddler just talking about Josh

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,160
Kay about this sort of like a toddler

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,440
learning to walk or learning to speak it

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,630
gets it wrong first it's not like goes

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,460
from 0 to 100 right away but it slowly

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,340
improves over time as it figures these

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,780
things out so once you've built your

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,010
model and you get it to a state where

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,510
you like you like how it's working

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,470
you're looking at the predictions it's

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,269
making it say making it you know

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,970
80% is good enough for your use case and

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,230
you move on and put it into production

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,399
so how does this work in production you

00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,139
can think of it as like a black box

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,029
behind your REST API is probably how

00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,730
you're going to do this with Drupal so

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,639
you're going to say upload a body of you

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,250
know JSON throw the body of your your

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,790
node into something into the model and

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,290
then you're going to get back a

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,120
prediction maybe here's a bunch of

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,829
recommended tags and that's how you

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,860
would use this with your poll right now

00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:21,100
PHP is not a great language for machine

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,110
learning Python and Scala and some

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,339
others are very popular so what you're

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,019
probably going to be doing in this case

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,459
is writing this as a separate you know

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,279
service oriented type thing that you're

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:32,139
going to connect with and it gets a

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,730
little bit more complicated but yeah

00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,399
there's this idea of having different

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,930
sets of data so you take your both set

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,029
of data your training on the data you

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,379
don't want it to just blindly remember

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,879
the data which can happen which is

00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,579
called overfitting you want it to

00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,589
actually figure out the data in a

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,029
generalistic way you want to generalize

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,579
about where these categories should be

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,410
so you see keep a subset of your data

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:58,449
and then that's the data that you're

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:59,769
testing with so the easiest way to do

00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,110
this is to forget everything I just said

00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:04,000
right and just use something off the

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,110
shelf right so just like Mahlum it's a

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,069
service you have to use you don't but

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,839
think about the machine learning going

00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:12,639
on so we have face detection face

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,089
detection has been around for a while it

00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,939
works very well so we'll move on that's

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,230
not that impressive as a superpower

00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:23,139
image classification we talked about is

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,839
an example with clarifying clarify uses

00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:29,139
a deep learning model behind the scenes

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,639
and they have a lot of categories and so

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,019
they come back and it's hard to see what

00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,630
the predictions on the right but these

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,529
are almost all in like almost 100%

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,860
predicted and we've got things like

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,600
sunset dawn boat reflection it even says

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,519
at the bottom that this is there's no

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,309
people in this photo so that can be

00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,639
helpful

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:50,019
we've got not-safe-for-work photos

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,939
there's an interesting documentary on

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,069
Vimeo that's called the moderators which

00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:57,100
looks at the people has anyone seen it

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,750
it's a basically the folks in India that

00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,949
has to look at all the smut that gets

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,860
uploaded every day to all these sites

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,370
and that is really a human driven thing

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,620
right now so

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,850
with a not-safe-for-work model you can

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,600
think about having a lot of your content

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,680
moderators job be handed off to an AI

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,660
but then they don't have to do with like

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,880
the obvious cases of pornography or

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,500
whatever they can just handle these sort

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,360
of in-between case so in this case it's

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,770
predicting sort of 50/50 accuracy

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,450
between not-safe-for-work and say for

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,980
work which is probably good right it's

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,210
like it's borderline I don't think

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,890
Arnold could lose too much clothing here

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:32,410
and still be safe for work we can also

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,930
do this with video so in this case it's

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,850
looking frame by frame across this video

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,660
and it's saying what are the different

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,070
categories in those frames so it's very

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,900
similar to image prediction but in this

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,580
case we sort of get a continuous line of

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,279
this and this could be really useful you

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,440
can imagine where if I'm a media company

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,200
and I want to find what was the video

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,180
that we had that had baseball in it and

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
it may have only been like a two second

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,779
clip inside a larger video but I can

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,779
search across my videos in this way

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,630
this is Watson so this gives you text

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,890
categorization so I would upload an

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,270
article in this case it was an article

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,890
about sort of how AI is going to take

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,240
over everything and it would give me

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,950
back predictions on different

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,750
hierarchies of categories so in this

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,850
case they're like I said these are off

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,550
the shelf so you could maybe think about

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,930
mapping some of these categories into

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,180
your own taxonomy if that was

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,470
appropriate for your site or maybe just

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,750
throwing a lot out your existing

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,550
taxonomy and just using the sort of

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,550
standard stock ones that they provide

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,860
check summarizing so this can be really

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,050
useful

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,660
we have oftentimes a lot of legacy

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,550
content or we've imported importing

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,050
content from other system through pool

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,130
has a summary field that can be really

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,190
useful or a pain in the neck depending

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,959
on your case and what we may want to do

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,080
is even have sort of a dynamic summary

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,650
where maybe 500 characters was okay for

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,300
our previous summary but now we want to

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,040
have it on you know Twitter or something

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,110
like that we want to provide a 100

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,430
character version of it this is an

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,070
example of a site that allows us to do

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,900
it so I uploaded the same article that

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,170
was all about how AI is going to take

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,050
over and it cut it down by 90% and just

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,510
gave me like a one sentence output and

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,040
if you can read it it's a very

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,720
impressive very accurate what it would

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,389
have cut it down to we talked about

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,800
speech-to-text

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,360
they're still running gag of house you

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,620
know stupid series that doesn't

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,470
understand what you're saying but

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,110
believe me like it we're at like say 90

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,220
95 percent predictability rate and we're

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,680
getting better and better and so those

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,940
last like nine we all work on the web

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,899
you know how many nines maybe you have

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,800
to worry about so getting those last few

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,930
getting those last few inches can be

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,430
some of the toughest to do so in this

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,079
case I just read something on the back

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,430
of a book I was pretty far away didn't

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,860
have a very good like headset or

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,970
anything and it picked it up pretty well

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,589
some companies are starting to get smart

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,360
with the environment so they're taking

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,070
their there X right there input data

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,529
they're actually mixing in the audio

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,209
with you know conference noise or

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,500
outside noise or restaurant noise and

00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,240
they're actually maybe able to make it

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,079
handle those situations better because

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,959
they're able to augment the data we

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,310
talked about translation let's talk

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,519
about language detection so this could

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,480
be really useful if you say we're taking

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,370
queries and you want to send it off to

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,019
solar or elasticsearch it might be

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,880
helpful to know even if people land it

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,230
on your comm site and they didn't switch

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,670
the language that you could detect the

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,709
language beforehand automatically

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,980
provide their read queries so that could

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,420
be useful so those are all kind of

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,430
off-the-shelf either available right now

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,649
here's some ones that are a little bit

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,750
hybrid so you're using your own data or

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,100
at least you can start with their model

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,600
and then expand on it with your own data

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,660
but it's still much easier than starting

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,060
from scratch in this case it's a text

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,800
classification so if you're making say a

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,360
chatbot or something like that people

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,829
may ask the same question multiple ways

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,180
and you can sort of just think out or

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,519
maybe you could look at your existing

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,680
conversation data or search data and you

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,690
could sort of hand categorize hand label

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,069
well what are they asking for by asking

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,660
for movie recommendations they're asking

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,949
product information and you have all

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,630
these different permutations of the

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:09,279
questions that they would ask you can

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,079
upload that data that x and y data we

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,300
talked about up to the watson service

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,819
and it will actually process do the

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,470
learning for you so it's nice sort of a

00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,750
hybrid solution that is also available

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,670
from the others Google etc where you can

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,959
easily just give them your data and they

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,160
already have the model and they handle

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,959
the training and then once it's trained

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,089
you just hit up a REST API like you

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,200
would with something else so this can be

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,670
handy

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,500
here's an example with image

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,300
classification now these are two

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,670
different types of dinghy sailboats or

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,260
whatever I'm not a sail person so they

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,810
don't make a lot of difference to me you

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,510
can see they look very similar in this

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,860
case someone uploaded and labeled and it

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,970
what's cool is like because most of the

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,010
training was done they only had to ham

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,480
label maybe ten different examples for

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,630
each and they made their own custom

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,370
classifier that said this is a opti or

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,380
whatever a brand and this is a laser

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,209
brand so you can think about like

00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,829
products if you're doing like product

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,209
related things or maybe you're

00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,940
automatically importing products maybe

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,860
this would be something handy for you so

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,740
we get back to sort of the DIYs the

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,149
harder machine learning do-it-yourself

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,630
but it opens up a lot of cool things

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:15,790
like yours file transfer and you know I

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,709
forget if you know I'm not an Instagram

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,420
or snapchat person but I don't know if

00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,820
they have these these things yet but if

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,709
they don't they will soon so you know in

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,740
this case we're able to take the Mona

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,510
Lisa and we're able to re re implement

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,160
it in the style of other things other

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:34,930
paintings face detection isn't available

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,680
as far as I know from a service but it's

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,320
something that you could implement

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,480
yourself it's actually very good you can

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,130
notice Facebook and other programs of

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,649
how good they are finding who you are

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,820
and what faces are what so this is

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,649
basically how they're doing it right

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,990
they find a face they throw it into a

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,250
neural net and they get some clustering

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,079
and they say okay this persons you know

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,970
likelihood is between this person this

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,199
person this person and obviously if you

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,589
have your social graph it makes a little

00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,910
easier to figure out exactly what is

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:04,089
image captions this is something else we

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,220
could use for Drupal I think for for

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,839
visually impaired folks it could be very

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,280
useful for readers to be able to look at

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,709
an image and say well what image is this

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,959
give me an example of this caption so

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,150
here a man in a black shirt is playing

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,350
the guitars on the far left and it's not

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,150
perfect right if you look on the

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,280
right-hand side it says boy is doing

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,949
backflip on a wakeboard well he's not on

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,850
a wakeboard it's like a trampoline but

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:26,829
you can see the water in the background

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,780
and you could see how it makes sense

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,980
right so it's interesting when they get

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,260
it when it gets it wrong it gets it

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,110
wrong in an interesting way generally

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,520
and so you can see using this when

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,440
people upload to the site it's always a

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,030
pain to get them to put in the alt text

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,650
maybe you just say screw it I'm going to

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,850
have it you know we'll still recommend

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,230
them to do the alt text

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,910
I'll just provide it automatically and

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,230
that will cover our accessibility issues

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,260
and we get to generation which I think

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,000
is really interesting so we think it's

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,380
like user-generated content but we don't

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,630
think necessary yet of like machine

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,179
generated content this is an example

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:04,240
where what's called a recurrent neural

00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:06,070
net was given Shakespeare and it just

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,539
learned on Shakespeare over and over and

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,549
over again and it was able to create

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:14,789
this now all these are words it sort of

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,320
gets the idea of iambic pentameter it

00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:19,600
even predicts like the capitalization

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,789
for the names of the characters it knows

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,650
to put like two space or two carriage

00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,900
returns before the next person speaks it

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,130
learns how to put the semicolons so it

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,530
learns all this just by learning how to

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,850
predict one letter in front of it so you

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,799
can think of other ways that this could

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,169
be interesting people are using it for

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,640
instance for image generation so how

00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,870
many people have seen this just like

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,870
took over the internet for a day and a

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,850
half so you're able to draw a picture of

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,520
a cat and left hand side and the model

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,960
basically does its best to say okay this

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,630
is what a cat would look like if that

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,480
drawing was real and it can lead to some

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,480
of these very scary strange-looking cat

00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,350
these are actually some two that are so

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,220
I would recommend it I think it's a not

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,780
cat to cat but something like that so

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,520
you can think about this other ways it's

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,590
doing similar things with music where

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,700
you can sort of give it a little riff or

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,299
something like that and it's starting to

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,919
put together other more nuanced

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:18,610
predictions of what other pieces or

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,590
motifs that you can put together we're

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,990
doing things with voices so there's some

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,700
pretty realistic singing voices that are

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,490
happening you can imagine where that

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,580
could go like auto-tune on steroids we

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,750
need to pay the artists anymore so

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,390
here's another one maybe a little more

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,250
applicable to Drupal it allows you to

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,200
upscale images so this can be really

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,730
useful you know the displays that we're

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,289
using or going up and up and up and

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,490
display size but you have a bunch of

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,900
these old images maybe you don't have

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,750
access to the originals anymore to

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,330
reroute them so in this way what it does

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:52,210
is the original images are on the right

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,620
hand side the down sampled image is on

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,240
the left hand side you can see sort of

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,039
how bad it gets and then

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
the one just the right of it is just

00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,360
sort of averaging across so you get this

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,399
blurry image but if you go one more to

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,700
the right to the third from the left

00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:09,350
that is what it predicts so it's able to

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,990
go from an original image and you can

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:15,230
see there are some differences right but

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,779
it's predicting the reasonable outputs

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,999
to these so you could see this used for

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,070
good for just say okay this movie or

00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,659
whatever was in VHS when it was

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,639
originally made and we want to upscale

00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,869
it make it look better you could also

00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,549
see some sort of nefarious things

00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,529
happening right where you know you see

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,490
an image but and it looks realistic but

00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,330
maybe it's been altered in some

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:38,360
interesting ways so here's an example

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,720
something I did you know we're often

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,419
used to using search solar etc this is

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,230
an implementation of an image search so

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,450
what I did was said about to two hundred

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,119
thousand images from yell through a

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,700
system and then got some features and

00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,869
then I was able to search by uploading a

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,490
new image and saying what are the

00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,409
closest images based on the image that I

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:06,350
uploaded so you could do this in Drupal

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:07,999
with the help of some AI so going beyond

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,600
where we're at now there's this idea

00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:13,009
that we are your developers we're used

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,710
to constructing things putting together

00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,509
if statements where the AI is really

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,490
different modes of thinking you're

00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,720
growing something so you may be tweaking

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,940
the nutrients that you're giving it

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,309
you're may be breeding two things

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,139
together and so it's a different mindset

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,940
and I think it's a helpful mindset for

00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,110
us to start getting into now to at least

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,399
know what's available maybe start

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,759
implementing those things on our sites

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:36,110
and so that we're ready for you know the

00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,840
next things to come which could be

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,129
significant so again we're in the

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,879
machine learning boff is going to be

00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:44,840
today at 5 p.m. in room 312 hope to see

00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,919
you there if you want to go into some

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,509
more detail we could talk more about

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,700
like what is really going on with deep

00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:56,869
learning and so yeah follow me on Frank

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,059
Harry and don't forget to do the session

00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,559
review I'm sure you're getting that from

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:02,559
everyone so thank you

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,670
so we've got a few minutes any questions

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,460
there's a mic here - I think we'll try

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:28,170
to record it I think that's the idea

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:29,970
oh hi so I was just wondering with what

00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:33,150
don't go anywhere there's another good

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,210
talk right what kind of tools would you

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,490
recommend that connect to Drupal the

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,890
best would be like some deep learning

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,809
Java thing or as far as I know there's

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,179
there's sort of two types of modules

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,650
there's like specific modules that maybe

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,230
work with Google's image search for

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,270
instance but there's no sort of like

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,040
Search API and that's something that I'm

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,200
actually interested in talking to people

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,900
about at the boss of being able to sort

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,120
of create a standard API to do some of

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,260
these predictions especially okay thank

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,780
you could you both described an average

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,780
data set that one might be able to learn

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:13,140
off of and then also what computational

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,490
power like let's say in hours an average

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,660
computer would take to process that data

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,160
sure so the first question was like what

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,330
is a tipple - data set look like and the

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,580
second was sort of how long does it take

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,280
so a simple data set you're going to

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,870
want quite a few instances so if you've

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,210
got a website that has five pieces of

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,820
content is very hard to learn from those

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,140
right just like a kid if you only show

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,340
them five pictures of a dog they might

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,840
not know what a Chihuahua is because

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,320
I've never seen something like that so

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,360
the more data the better and the types

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,340
of data you're looking at images a lot

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,320
of text data you can get into more

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,760
nuanced things but this sort of text and

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,850
image stuff seems to be the most common

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,340
and how long does it take to train you

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,190
can train a model in as quick as you

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,900
know I'm talking like half a million

00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,610
images or something like that you can

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,559
train it pretty quickly what's getting

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,410
what's interested in what helps to have

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,929
is like a GPU big GPU helps it maybe to

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,820
save you like a fifth of the time but

00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,929
it's not necessary you could run this on

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,710
your laptop it just might take a little

00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:16,470
longer so it depends on the model really

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,850
there's a very wide gambit so the image

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,000
net competition those guys are training

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,270
it

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,470
for a week like 24/7 what's nice is

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,670
there's a thing called transfer learning

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,530
where let's say I want to do something

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,060
image related I can actually just steal

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,740
their model and you can think of it as

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,300
figuring out this hierarchical

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,460
representation of the images so low

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,900
level it's like edges and lines and

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,430
circles and then it starts to get more

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,080
high-level as you go sort of up the

00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,840
stack of the deep the deep part of the

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,940
deep learning and with that you can

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,010
train a new model very quickly with just

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,570
a with much less data as well because it

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,010
sort of already figured out vision it

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,390
just needs to figure out the boat versus

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,830
so you know different types of sailboats

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,270
like you saw in that case I think they

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:56,220
did with like ten examples it's pretty

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:58,470
impressive there are some good course

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,730
materials available for getting started

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:05,660
but I was curious if you could recommend

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,620
some books where people would say

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,290
particularly people that have math stats

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,360
background what it takes to get from

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:19,170
there to a working knowledge of the

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,640
speed of learning algorithms sure and

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,590
there's quite a few so like deep

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,340
learning is its own sort of niche but

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,440
there are other more traditional

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,020
learning algorithms that are available I

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,310
posted if my buffer thing worked

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,020
correctly I scheduled it to post

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,840
something to my Twitter account at Frank

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,160
Gehry and that should it's a blog post I

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
just wrote this morning with like some

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,780
additional material blogs that you could

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,950
read some of the companies that we

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,660
mentioned some of the things that we

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,550
mentioned in this in the slides so if

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,500
you go to add Frank Gehry it sure if

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,100
anyone's gone there and doesn't see it

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,050
let me know but it should be there now

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,910
it looks like deep learning is very

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,430
different from the development but what

00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:01,590
are debugging debugging techniques are

00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:03,390
there they're not easy so it's just like

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,970
you know how would you do a four year

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,270
old learning to walk or I guess younger

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,860
than four of course it's tricky right

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,870
just to think about it's tricky like

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,310
maybe there you come up with some

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,720
hypotheses just like you do with regular

00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,860
debugging you say maybe they're not

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,210
getting the right information maybe

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,220
their balance is off or something right

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,450
you start to figure out why why aren't

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,240
they learning when I think they should

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,160
or something like that maybe the brain

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,110
is wrong or something right I mean see

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,260
the trick is though because you don't

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,540
have like a traditional debugger right

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,980
you can step through the code but some

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,480
of that's changing like the if you use a

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,090
framework like tensorflow

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,280
I think they just released like actual

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,050
debugger recently but other things you

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,030
can look at are sort of as it's learning

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,620
you think of as like you know all these

00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,850
neurons and you can see the levels of

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,200
the neurons like what values they are

00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,400
and if they only go to zero then you

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,540
know something's wrong if they go to a

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,100
billion and that's you know something

00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,260
else is wrong so you can sort of see the

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,430
results over time and when you're when

00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,960
you're doing these are called epochs

00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,920
you're learning learning learning what

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,640
you'll see is like you're getting better

00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,450
and better and better and based on how

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,460
you know maybe you're getting better and

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,200
better better but you're not learning

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,970
like you're not generalizing then you're

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,110
overfitting so you start to learn these

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,880
techniques and unfortunately they're

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,620
like nothing like traditional

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,170
development so it's not it's not trivial

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,180
to jump into it but it's also not that

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,100
scary I mean I guarantee you if you have

00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,040
reasonable programming skills you could

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,730
get a deep neural net running in an hour

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,310
on your laptop with a blog post thank

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:32,780
you yeah do you want to jump up and I'll

00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:35,590
field a couple more questions for you

00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,590
