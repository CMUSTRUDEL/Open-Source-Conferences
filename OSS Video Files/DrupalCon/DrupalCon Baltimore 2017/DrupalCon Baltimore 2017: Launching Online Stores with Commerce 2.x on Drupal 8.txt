Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Launching Online Stores with Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Drupal Commerce 2.x for Drupal 8 entered its beta phase in September 2016 and is rapidly advancing toward a full release thanks to contributors from around the world. In this session we present the project's history, architecture, and features, highlighting the changes that have made this version even more productive for building online stores.

To support Commerce 2.x development, Commerce Guys first released several standalone PHP libraries (e.g. for currency formatting and addressing) and then created modules that make use of them, such as the new Address module. Finally, we rebuilt Drupal Commerce itself from the ground up, taking full advantage of Drupal 8's new features -- and even improving them in turn!

Come learn how we've engineered Commerce 2.x to make it simpler to solve some of the hardest parts of eCommerce and removed the need for over 20 contributed modules along the way.

Using client sites we helped go live as examples, we will discuss and demonstrate topics including:

Installing Drupal Commerce and its dependencies
Creating and configuring one or multiple stores
Adding product pages and their variants
Customizing Add to Cart forms and Line Items
Configuring multiple custom Checkout flows
Managing Payment methods and their new UI
Managing Orders and their workflows
We'll close with an overview of the roadmap and status of the contributed module ecosystem, which has seen a lot of early development in payment integrations and shipping capabilities. We'll make sure everyone knows how to start contributing - there's always more to do! ; )

You do not need prior experience with Drupal Commerce to attend, but some familiarity with Drupal 8 and common challenges in eCommerce will help you get the most out of the material.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,700
I'm going to set a timer for 25 minutes

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:11,210
because that's how long we have to talk

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,099
about four years of activity this is a

00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,450
ambitious presentation about you know a

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,560
platform for ambitious digital

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,460
experiences let's see 25 minutes

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,789
starting now

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,470
and I'm going to kick us off and then

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,990
I'm going to hand the mic over to Matt

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:33,620
and Boyan to awkwardly like trade the

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:36,600
spot at the microphone yes yes we are

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,969
together the core maintainer z' of the

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,300
drupal commerce project this has been

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,980
kind of our bread and butter for years

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,670
together we make up the core team of

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,710
commerce guys we have four other can pay

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,800
treats commerce developers and

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,260
consultants that we work with and since

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,059
last year we have been functioning

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,100
independently at platform dot s eight we

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,629
separated the businesses so that we

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,399
could get back to our first love and

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,470
focus on our mission to engineer simpler

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,260
solutions to the hardest parts of

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,869
selling online and and not you know have

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,180
essentially a services team subsidize

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,330
the developments of an unrelated hosting

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,479
product so this renewed focus has given

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,009
us a chance to rededicate ourselves to

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,290
developing triple commerce the core

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,150
framework developing Drupal eight and

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,150
contributing to things like composure

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,590
support for Drupal 8 in drupal.org so

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,990
that we could ultimately have a stronger

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,790
e-commerce platform that we can sort of

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,490
refocus on building the ecosystem around

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,140
so this is where we are today but

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,939
sometimes it is helpful to take a step

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,030
back and just remind ourselves why do we

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,979
do Drupal commerce because we could if

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,259
we wanted to just become a Shopify

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,869
agency we could become Magento

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,640
developers if we wanted to so what is it

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,640
about Drupal commerce that still sets it

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,189
apart enough to keep us working in that

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,350
direction and the first thing of course

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,860
is that we we do fundamentally believe

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,899
in free software so that that's the the

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,829
F in free open source software free

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:11,400
software you know implies not just price

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,290
but also license and responsibility it's

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,849
free as in puppies as I've heard Jesse

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,909
say you can take the puppy but it is

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:22,079
yours now as I learned this year I made

00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:25,230
that mistake but but there there are

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:26,400
very few free open-source projects in

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,739
the world that support e-commerce even

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,319
our primary competitor Magento is

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,569
fundamentally like a kind of

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,980
where unless you have the money to buy

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,840
an enterprise license and then kind of

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,989
go from there we also believe though

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,450
that Drupal as a business application

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:44,609
platform is more flexible than the the

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,640
sort of core framework and api's if any

00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:49,109
other e-commerce specific application

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,280
and I'm not just talking about open

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:52,590
source offer I'm also talking about

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,299
Hybris and Demandware and these other

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,470
big applications that will compete

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,030
against but also at the low end as well

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,230
with Shopify WooCommerce virtuemart etc

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,079
Drupal is just fundamentally more

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,879
flexible and that's that's really kind

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,780
of core to the Drupal community overall

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,150
I don't think that should be surprise to

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,760
anybody we also believe that merchants

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,920
merchants and developers are going to

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,220
benefit when they Wed their commerce and

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,079
content like portions of the site we

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,819
aren't we aren't siloing you know your

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,829
ecommerce application on the sub domain

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,500
and your blog on a wordpress sub domain

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,449
and trying to sort of loosely string all

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,780
these things together we create this

00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,129
integrated whole in terms of like the

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,049
customer experience and shopping

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,910
experience but then also making it easy

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,190
to use Drupal commerce as a front-end

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,840
for third-party applications and these

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,690
we believe are our four of the key

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,730
selling points for Drupal commerce and

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,690
of course you know every particular site

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,910
you know will take them on a

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,379
case-by-case basis to decide what's a

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,540
good fit but this is this is what

00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,849
matters to us and people are using

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,500
Drupal commerce today to you know add

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,299
commerce to existing content sites to

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,849
create subscription sites and paywalls

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,199
to sell to sell file licenses such as

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:04,199
RiffTrax with the Mystery Science

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,510
Theater 3000 you know soundtracks sold

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,639
through Drupal commerce it's also

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,010
helpful that you can take Drupal

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,019
commerce and expand internationally

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,549
because we are multi currency

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,049
multilingual multi-store by default out

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,489
of the box and one of our largest

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,400
clients right now does this on a massive

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:22,289
scale um throughout Scandinavia

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,849
and-and-and have not yet hit the the

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,230
bounds of what you can do with Drupal

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,210
commerce we're talking hundreds of

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,970
concurrent sessions running through

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,950
check outside like there's the support

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,870
for scale both in terms of wrong numbers

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,430
but also in terms of channels and

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,320
languages and currencies and everything

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,020
else and then finally you can also

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,210
create one application that is really

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,580
good at combining multiple concerns

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,770
together including b2b sales and b2c

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,300
sales in one platform with loyalty

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,760
programs and so on and so forth there's

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,920
really nice rich front ends like the

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,410
recently launched or low watches website

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,950
so if you go to or lo watches comm this

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,110
was launched by 1x internet we met them

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,850
at Drupal con Dublin and they

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,620
disappeared for three months and produce

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,990
like one of the best tribal commerce

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,520
that I've ever seen and they're able to

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,610
do this with commerce 2x with a

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,660
completely custom checkout flow and and

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,340
who knows what else under the hood I

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,990
haven't had like a full debriefing but

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,420
you know boiling can always tell us more

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,920
about that as he talks through the

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,300
creation of the current version of

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,740
Drupal commerce yeah so did we know hey

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,530
I did take five minutes like you're

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,210
expected that's great well okay I love

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:35,040
hearing you talk Ryan it always so the

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,100
reason why commerce when the text was so

00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,290
successful was because we started from

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,790
scratch on Drupal 7 and we created an

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,550
application that was immediately

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,470
familiar to anyone who knew Drupal 7 and

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,460
if we wanted to repeat the same success

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,350
and to recreate that native feel we once

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,200
again needed to start from scratch on

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,480
Drupal 8 simply because Drupal 8 is such

00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,430
a different platform and that was a

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,320
great chance to reevaluate everything

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,170
that we've done all of the feedback

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,890
we've received to see what went well and

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:11,100
what went less well and simply do that

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,080
better this time around we realized that

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,610
in the beginning with commerce rondo

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,560
text we did not prioritize user

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,180
experience enough because we launched

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
without an identity forum and it took us

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,500
a year to develop this crucial UI

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,750
elements that were needed for easier

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,460
products entry and for a better checkout

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,790
experience and for a better customer

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,500
experience and in that time people got

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,180
the impression that commerce was not

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,840
user friendly enough even though we

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,690
solved that

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,639
especially what kickstart came around is

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,060
the

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:45,259
impression stock but this time around we

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,810
are doing all of that we are integrating

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:52,819
in all NC form and we are prioritizing

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:55,639
the check out UX we also realize that

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:59,360
it's not enough to simply be unappealing

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,060
it and opinionated it's great to have an

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,330
opinion developers just need a way to

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,990
provide their own to swap our

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,139
implementation and do their own thing

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,020
when business requirements dictates that

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:15,289
but we're definitely looking at more

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,379
opinionated framework and simply to help

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:22,310
other developers and agencies do their

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,199
job right because people are not asking

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,599
what it is that the Drupal commerce

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,240
module can do they are asking what the

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,909
Drupal commerce ecosystem can do and we

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,409
are all that ecosystem with our country

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,050
modules with our themes with our

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:39,949
distributions and with our agencies in

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,680
the community and we also realized that

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,440
commerce itself needs to grow out of the

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,990
top 60 contributed modules for Drupal 7

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,330
half of them are no longer needed for

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,699
Drupal 8 simply because we've taken that

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,949
functionality and incorporated it into

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,629
commerce to the tags or we simply

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,150
improved core enough to make those

00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:02,120
modules just not needed and that

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,849
includes modules that added elements to

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,710
checkout for example being able to login

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,750
or register at the beginning of checkout

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,940
being able to see at which checkout step

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,069
you are being able to register at the

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,860
end of checkout UI elements like that

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:19,009
then the ability to reuse addresses to

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:24,919
reuse credit cards and it goes on from

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:29,150
there as I said we were we started from

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:33,079
scratch and by now we've had over two

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,959
years of full-time full stream ahead

00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:38,029
development on Drupal 8 we are now

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,709
preparing to tag our last beta release

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,440
today or tomorrow right here in

00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:45,410
Baltimore in fact 30 minutes ago I

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,630
actually merged the tag sub module which

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,209
was the last remaining big piece in big

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,240
blocker and our plan is to tag an RC one

00:08:51,209 --> 00:09:00,720
by the end of May after we've reviewed

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,119
some of the other so basically this beta

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,189
gives you Texas gives you greatly

00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:07,470
improved promotions and then we want to

00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,670
fix all of the bugs that we can find and

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,309
at the end of may deliver something

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,550
that's really solid so that moving to

00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:18,209
July we can actually take a real 2.0

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:21,029
born boy on gets his mattress back yeah

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:28,579
then Ryan lets me return home to Serbia

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:30,959
I miss my family the good news is that

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,749
Drupal Commerce is production ready

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,389
right now there's an upgrade path you

00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:39,990
can start creating site there are dozens

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:42,749
of live sites launched already that I'm

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,300
intimately familiar with and there there

00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:47,429
are hundreds that I'm not familiar with

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,829
and there are over 20 payment gateways

00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:53,850
that you can use to actually collect

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:56,459
money and get your project started and

00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,869
more about features from my colleague

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,089
Matt so one of the great things in

00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:04,439
commerce too is the concept of stores so

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,009
you can have different stores that

00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:10,049
products belong to an order is made from

00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,699
so the store allows you to set what's

00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:13,230
that email if they need to contact that

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,689
specific store that they ordered from

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,730
billing address and then with the tax

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,470
items merged you can now define your tax

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,470
information per store so if you have a

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,389
Canadian store it will use the Canadian

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,459
taxes or if you have the US when you can

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,350
tap into it service like a Valera to

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,649
help calculate what taxes you have to

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,540
pay and one nice part about it too is

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,399
you can then use it to help with the

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,679
domain module or other ones to configure

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,929
how your store looks so if you do go to

00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,420
that or low watches play around with the

00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,860
different countries if you pick United

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,899
States you go to the International one

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,240
if you pick Denmark it actually brings

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,639
you to DK or low watches comm and I'm

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,470
pretty sure they're using domain with

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,749
stores to change how the site interacts

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,860
and what products are available based on

00:10:54,749 --> 00:11:00,990
that using one Drupal site then you can

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,340
learn more about stores on our blog we

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,950
have a story there

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,880
yeah so products and one dot X if you're

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,370
familiar with it

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,110
there is notes which reference products

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,080
and that was a product display and it

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:20,010
was kind of a disjointed UX so now we

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,960
just have the product entity and within

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,330
it our variations variations are what

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,560
you buy right when you go and send

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,060
somebody to go pick an order they have

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
different palettes that are your

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,350
different products I have a large shirt

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,800
yeah the medium shirt will say Ryan is a

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,360
small

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,390
so that's your variation in the coin

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,920
come on okay and to make to identify

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,770
different variations you use product

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,510
attributes color size if you have a

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,640
subscription platform this could be your

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,400
term length is it quarterly is it yearly

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,410
is it however that goes so this just

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,270
helps you identify what makes the

00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:01,980
different things that people are buying

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:04,320
yep and so what product attributes to

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,570
you is so one dot X if you wanted to

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,070
show fancy attributes is what we're

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,320
calling this because this is if you go

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,030
shop online you see this at every single

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,470
ecommerce store where the color is a

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:18,810
swatch it doesn't just say red so if so

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,940
this allows you to use the new entities

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,850
the improved energy system and display

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,370
modes to actually turn the attribute

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,900
into a rendered color field so there's

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,060
actually a color field module which

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,990
finally had a critical bug fixed so this

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,670
demo works without a patch and it allows

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,530
you to then pick different colors and

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,720
change those and we have a demo down at

00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,240
our booth in the Expo Center so if you

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,340
come we can show this live or if you go

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,510
we can give you a few different URLs to

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:51,120
try this out on and then we have

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,130
different order types and order item

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,540
types and why this is special is if you

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,970
have different flows let's say you have

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,280
a mixed store that sells physical and

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,110
digital products if you have a physical

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,210
product you need to capture shipping

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,770
information in a shipping method but if

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,660
you're selling an e-book at the same

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,490
time you don't need to collect that

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,130
information so you need a specific

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:14,330
experience for people to go through and

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,330
this allows you to do that

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,550
and then that ties in visit checkout

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,610
flow so you can have different buying

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,770
experiences that people can go through

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,530
buying mimic the field the field UI for

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,090
configuring checkouts so if you're used

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,370
to configuring fields you can configure

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,050
this real well this the different steps

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,740
is what we're calling them so login

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,520
order information or where pains will go

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,930
and then you can configure you click the

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,270
you can click the COG and configure it

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,980
for instance there's a log in and you

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,050
can change it to be guest allowed or

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,080
they have to register should be the next

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,070
slide so we've taken that UX to join

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,380
write one thing before we we leave this

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,090
part that I really wanted to mention

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,010
because it's really really cool and

00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,020
really important so when we were

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,060
creating our stores we realized that

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,950
many stores have very very different

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,250
kinds of product that they sell which

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,260
dictates a need for completely different

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,360
checkout experiences for example we

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,370
would sell digital products like

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,710
platform data stage subscriptions but at

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,510
the same time we might be selling event

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,430
registrations for example selling our

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,530
own trainings and then some other sites

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,170
were at the same time sell physical

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,600
products and digital products and these

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,010
groups of products had completely

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,110
different types of cards forms and

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,910
completely different checkouts

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,040
but since commerce wand attacks always

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,560
had a single order type and on a single

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,480
check house type it was not easy to

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
create these completely separate

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,370
experiences and simply plugs our logic

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
in but this time since we support

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,380
different order types since we support

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,720
multiple checkout flows that map to them

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,630
we can easily create this out of the box

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,060
so we can click together checkout flows

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,400
with different numbers of steps and

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,930
different information requires based on

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,360
what we're selling and since the

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,450
checkout flows are backed by plugins

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,700
they can actually affect how the steps

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,430
are displayed so one plug-in might have

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,680
a page for checkout step but another

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,290
might have an accordion like you have on

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,800
the Apple store website and all of that

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,750
is given to us by this greatly improved

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,140
API that we've built

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:35,850
and which ties into what we've done with

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:38,459
the improved checkout UX okay I kind of

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,520
sold my kind of I'm terrible

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,980
so with the checkout 2x we looked as a

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,130
hundred websites all of the biggest

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,959
e-commerce stores and looked at other

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,540
systems to see just what the latest

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,540
trends are and what the requirements are

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,270
and how we can improve commerce to be

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,399
better and how it can convert better and

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,459
some of the results are already in

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,680
others will be visible in the future

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,750
because it's an ongoing process but the

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,459
first thing we did is we now have a

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,620
checkout progress block that you can see

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,480
at the top so that you can see on which

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,940
step you are and what the other ones are

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,420
that requires a separate country module

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,029
you can configure whether you allow

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,180
anonymous checkout or not which forces

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:26,790
the user to register on this screen or

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,760
give them a button to basically skip

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,470
this step you of course you can allow

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,560
the returning users to log in right away

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:39,000
so that replaces the checkout redirect

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:43,020
module and it goes from there we have

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,180
the ability to reuse cards so we we save

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,190
the credit cards if the system is

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,200
configured to do so and then the

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,240
customer when they return they can use a

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,480
previous car the previous address with

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,430
no extra modules we've also moved the

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,740
order summary to the side bar because

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,899
that's what sites now do and it's much

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,180
easier to customize it can have panes of

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,730
its own which means that customers can

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,709
actually modify the cards from there if

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,050
a country module makes it possible or

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,120
they can input a coupon codes there we

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,970
actually have an issue for that that

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,929
adds a coupon code to the side bar so

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:22,559
once again we have improved this screen

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,660
as well other complaints were that the

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,220
review step was not easy to same so

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:33,150
simply anything we could we rewrote to

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,429
be more more friendly and the if you

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,210
look at the blog post we did for alpha 4

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,279
where you can see

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,450
some of the details around these UI

00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:45,309
elements and we will be providing more

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:51,039
information about our reasoning once we

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:54,220
tag an RC one payments were a big thing

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,770
that we worked on and we've spent many

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,330
many weeks on payments and then my

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,950
laptop got stolen and all of that code

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:05,470
disappeared that Drupal dev days Malan

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,390
it was a nice yeah yeah that was a fun

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,669
summer so then we worked on payments

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,039
again and didn't have any fuel cost me

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,500
on the new laptop and then this time the

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,440
code was on github so the coffee did not

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,059
affect the the code but the second

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:26,080
version of the code was even better and

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:32,799
what we did was create yeah I'm crying

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:35,230
inside so we created an API that that

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,340
allows developers to do much less work

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,140
when they create a payment gateway

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,029
previously you needed to spend around

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,909
five days building the payment gateway

00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,980
for commerce Wando tags but now you can

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,440
create an equivalent payment gateway in

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,450
about three to four hours simply because

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,370
our API does a lot more we have

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,059
integrated commerce cards on file which

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,740
allows tokenizing payments methods and

00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,710
allows saving cards so they can be

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,990
reused in a PCI compliant way we've

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,110
added support for alternative payment

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,200
methods such as paying by paypal that's

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:11,140
the Braintree module now takes advantage

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,559
of we've created different kinds of

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,870
payment gateways so that you can choose

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,820
the template that you need to copy when

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,070
you're creating your gateway so we now

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,309
say the gateway can either be on site

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,380
which means the form is on your checkout

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,929
page and probably uses JavaScript

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,820
tokenized like stripe or Braintree and

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,770
then we have the off-site gateway that I

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,200
just send you to a different site to

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,230
enter your credit card information or

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,090
show you an iframe and usually copy one

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,010
of those and then we have a third

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,230
category that is now in progress it's

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,980
called the manual payment gateways which

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,779
basically create the payments without

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,340
communicating with an external API so

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,779
that

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,820
a cash-on-delivery paying by invoice

00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,870
those kinds of things that's and again

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,140
this is the functionality that

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,900
previously required external controls

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,870
but is now possible out of the box with

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,789
Drupal commerce I already mentioned we

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,669
have over 20 payment gateways out of

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,870
that commerce guys developed six

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,539
Braintree was our reference

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,330
implementation and I can still say that

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,309
they are the nicest API to work with and

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,289
pretty much the nicest option you can

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:26,940
use right now they're owned by PayPal

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:29,279
but don't take that against them we also

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,580
have an actual PayPal module if you're

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,760
into that we we have an authorize.net

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,370
module which is now which needs to get

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,490
accept J as improvements in that library

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,409
but it's a very popular choice and they

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,539
have a good API all of these are

00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:48,480
recommended people have integrated

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:52,620
strife and Daniel also from our

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,990
organization yeah and and since recently

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,179
Square they are now actually demoing at

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,210
our booth so you can stop by and see how

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,799
that's working so those are our golden

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,950
payment gateways and then it goes from

00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:07,559
there into a variety of small local ones

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:11,159
because in the u.s. it's easy people use

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:14,250
stripe PayPal Braintree but in Europe

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,130
every country has its own completely odd

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:22,110
gateways so that's why the number keeps

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:24,000
increasing and Matt's will tell you

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,570
about promotions in courses that have

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,460
been his baby yeah so one in these seven

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,950
lands from discounts was its own module

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,740
and coupons was his own module on top of

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,029
that and they were kind of it didn't

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,520
really work well together yeah they did

00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:40,500
they should have been nice together but

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,809
they didn't exactly cooperate so now

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,870
into Dex we brought it in-house so that

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:47,940
way it could just be more more control

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,640
over it and just get it right right out

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,140
of the box so we have it where there's

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,779
different offers and these are all

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,309
plugins so you can you can just right

00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,470
you can take what we have out of the box

00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,149
or easily write some code that uses the

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,030
same architecture that you find

00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:03,820
everywhere within Drupal and speaking of

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,100
that there's no

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,840
rules is the rules module I don't know

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,670
if it even moved in the past few months

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,100
or not but when we first investigated

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,800
this rules was an alpha and it actually

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,630
extended the conditions plugins in core

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,190
which powered block placement so it's

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,140
like great there's already the existing

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,630
API inside of core that we can leverage

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,880
so we did and that power is the

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,100
condition system so your offer could say

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,960
I want to give 10% off the order total

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,160
well then you add different conditions

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,170
as a set of price or maybe a location

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,270
and then we also have coupons so it's

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,610
coupons are just another condition but

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,430
the condition is you have to enter a

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,320
certain code coupons and promotions have

00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,820
usage limits so you could say you could

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,430
say that the promotion has unlimited

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,230
usages but you can only use each coupon

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,660
five times something like that certainly

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,930
a start and end date to control when it

00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,810
starts when it finishes and then we have

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:01,600
basic compatibility and so you could say

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,340
yes always apply this promotion or no

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,830
this promotion cannot be applied if

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,320
there's other promotions available and

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,800
that will be being extended as people

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,590
start implementing more and more time

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,660
yes and this was born actually this was

00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,460
pushed forward by two different client

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,380
projects that I was on including the

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,290
coupon pain Redemption which is like

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,150
inches away from being part of it so

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:33,340
it's great to have adopters that push

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:36,790
things forward and I mentioned that we

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:40,150
just merged taxes which provide a an API

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,430
that allows both remote calculation and

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,650
local calculations so in the US and

00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,090
sales tax is completely crazy you can

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,850
and should use Avalara and that

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,680
integrates into our system nicely but

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,800
also if you want to hard-code the rates

00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,290
that you're using you can input your

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,380
rates and you can input the zone to

00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,720
which it's attached so you can say these

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,820
rates apply in South Carolina and these

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,330
apply in Kentucky and then figure it out

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,210
from there

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,650
and then what we've done is create a

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,280
custom plugin for the European Union

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,039
which

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,669
actually provides all of the all of

00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:18,880
their rates along with logic for b2b and

00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:20,559
b2c sales and digital and physical

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,169
product so basically functioning like a

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,480
small tax cloud for the European Union

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,400
which I realize is not that interesting

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,380
to people in Baltimore but it's pretty

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:35,890
neat no other no recon versa yeah yeah

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,620
we've spent many many months researching

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,990
taxes and there is no e-commerce system

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,970
that does taxes as well as we do and we

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,350
are looking forward to actually teaching

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:52,809
the world once we actually have a

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:55,710
release out we have a really old blog

00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:58,210
that talks about some of our use cases

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,980
so that's a good starting point and

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,120
we'll be blogging about this more when

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:06,850
rc1 rolls around we have shipping oh god

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,500
I forgot about that so we have a great

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,240
shipping module it has support for

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,460
multiple shipments which means you can

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,740
ship to multiple locations at the same

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,919
time or you can always shift to the same

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:20,620
location but package the orders the

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,260
order items into several boxes based on

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,720
weight or stock location or whatever

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,169
else is being done and that's what's

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,110
done for Interflora dot DK which is a

00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:34,150
flower delivery website which is huge in

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,700
Europe and there Danish site is now on

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,690
commerce to the techs all right well we

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,000
don't actually have time for questions

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,150
from the stage because the timer has

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,940
gone off is Jesper in here trying that I

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,830
don't see him well the gentleman who was

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,059
in charge of the inter floor website is

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,159
here which is really cool to meet him

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,409
and I hope that this presentation at

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,539
least underscored this fact that much of

00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:59,200
what we've developed is technologically

00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:01,299
superior and also borne out of real live

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,190
