Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Launching Online Stores with Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Drupal Commerce 2.x for Drupal 8 entered its beta phase in September 2016 and is rapidly advancing toward a full release thanks to contributors from around the world. In this session we present the project's history, architecture, and features, highlighting the changes that have made this version even more productive for building online stores.

To support Commerce 2.x development, Commerce Guys first released several standalone PHP libraries (e.g. for currency formatting and addressing) and then created modules that make use of them, such as the new Address module. Finally, we rebuilt Drupal Commerce itself from the ground up, taking full advantage of Drupal 8's new features -- and even improving them in turn!

Come learn how we've engineered Commerce 2.x to make it simpler to solve some of the hardest parts of eCommerce and removed the need for over 20 contributed modules along the way.

Using client sites we helped go live as examples, we will discuss and demonstrate topics including:

Installing Drupal Commerce and its dependencies
Creating and configuring one or multiple stores
Adding product pages and their variants
Customizing Add to Cart forms and Line Items
Configuring multiple custom Checkout flows
Managing Payment methods and their new UI
Managing Orders and their workflows
We'll close with an overview of the roadmap and status of the contributed module ecosystem, which has seen a lot of early development in payment integrations and shipping capabilities. We'll make sure everyone knows how to start contributing - there's always more to do! ; )

You do not need prior experience with Drupal Commerce to attend, but some familiarity with Drupal 8 and common challenges in eCommerce will help you get the most out of the material.
