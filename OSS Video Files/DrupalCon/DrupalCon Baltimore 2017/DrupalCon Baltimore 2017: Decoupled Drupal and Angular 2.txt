Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Decoupled Drupal and Angular 2
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	With decoupled Drupal gaining more steam by the day and unprecedented approaches entering the mainstream, the need to keep abreast of current front-end technologies has never been more paramount. Angular 2, released last year, is a significant leap forward for the Angular ecosystem with TypeScript usage, a built-in command-line interface, and a focus on "develop once, push everywhere," including web, mobile web, and native. Though the framework has evolved drastically away from Angular 1's versatile yet sometimes unwieldy developer experience, the Angular 2 team has endeavored to ease the transition by providing a graduated transition path from Angular 1 to Angular 2 applications.

Angular has an enthusiastic and large community with ample surrounding tooling. It's an excellent candidate for integration with a decoupled Drupal back end, whether you're using JSON API or Drupal 8's built-in core REST API. Join me as we spelunk into the undiscovered depths of Angular 2 as we dive into the depths of TypeScript (including decorators), observables, Angular 2 components and services, and promise-based communication with Drupal 8.

Here's some of the questions we'll answer together:

Why Angular 2? Why TypeScript?
Why not Angular 1? Why not ES6?
How is Angular 2 architected?
What are the key concepts in Angular 2?
How do I set up, build, and develop an Angular 2 application?
How do I build Angular 2 components and services?
How does routing work in Angular 2?
How do I set up decoupled Drupal 8?
How do I foster communication between Angular 2 and Drupal 8?
What are some of the implications of Drupal-backed Angular 2?

I was triple con so far oh come on you

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,070
could be better than that how's triple

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:12,630
con so far all right so I heard there

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,219
was a brief mention with me this morning

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,289
how many of you here just because of

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,420
that okay well welcome this is decoupled

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,800
Drupal and angular 2 and once again if

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,960
you're standing up in the back there's a

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,970
few seats Brewster at wiggle around here

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,279
in the front if you'd like to comment

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,200
and slide in so just to get a sense of

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,750
the room here I just want to ask a

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,480
couple of questions how many people have

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,210
heard of decoupled or headless or API

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,820
first Drupal okay pretty much everybody

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,620
how many people have worked with angular

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,450
one in the past

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,300
okay good amount of people how about

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,879
angular 2 okay some people alright so

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,710
not not everybody that's good and how

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,440
many people have worked with Jason API

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,680
before in Drupal 8 alright that's a

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,979
great show of hands ok so this session

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,390
is going to be relatively introductory

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm just going to sort of issue a fair

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,930
warning here that we are going to talk

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,390
about setting up Drupal at the backend

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,930
and how to get that going how to get a

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,189
decoupled Drupal repository set up and

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,729
it's going to use basically the most

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,200
recent version 8.3 along with JSON API

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,409
the second half of this presentation is

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,270
going to cover more about angular 2 and

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,350
for those of you who have already done

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,270
for example how many people have already

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,090
done the tour of Heroes tutorial when I

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,369
go to you ok great so a lot of this

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,009
presentation is actually quite strongly

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,540
based on that tutorial mainly because I

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,630
really like how it introduces a lot of

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,630
concepts but a lot of it will be amended

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,840
to kind of reflect what we're doing here

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,200
so and then at the end we're going to

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,790
talk about just some kind of overarching

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,860
big-picture kinds of things so I already

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,509
are you all ready come on Roy all right

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,329
cool as well all right so after lunch

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,009
kind of like well here all right so just

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,399
introduce myself my name is Preston so

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm Ben web developer since oh one been

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,560
in trouble since oh seven

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,989
and I've been working quite a bit in the

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,519
office of CTO at Acquia as the

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,040
development manager of aqua labs which

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,860
is our innovation and experimental

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,239
projects arm so I do a lot of speaking

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,650
you've probably heard me give a lot of

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,920
talks about a couple drupal in the past

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,989
and it's a real pleasure to be here so

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,670
oh by the way if you want to contact me

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,620
or look at my Drupal drug profile

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,959
there's some information about me up

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,150
there so you're not going to cover I

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,160
want to talk about what angular actually

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,630
is some of the history of angular very

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,190
briefly what are the differences between

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,890
typescript how many people have written

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,840
typescript before okay awesome

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,420
that's good okay how many people have

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,220
written es6 before the new version of

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,840
javascript okay some more hands perfect

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,489
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,410
go through and what I really want to do

00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,940
today is do something very similar to

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,379
the last time I gave a talk like this

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,269
which is to do a bit of a live coding

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,760
session I'm hoping that the internet

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,560
bears with us if not I do have a version

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,650
of the application already ready to go

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,599
and live and all good to go just in case

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,299
the internet kind of goes to plump on us

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,069
so I want introduce the key concept of

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,720
angular I want to talk about connecting

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,549
with Drupal as well and then I also want

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,940
to talk about some of the implications

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,639
of angular 2 and what's involved in

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,380
angular ecosystem in general so what

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,269
exactly is angular well for those of you

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,250
who don't know the history of angular is

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,560
actually very interesting angular

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,780
actually started out as a very

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,989
interesting project in that it was

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,190
started by Mishka hevery as a

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,690
prototyping framework it wasn't actually

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,730
ever intended to be a fully fledged

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,500
application framework and so for those

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,930
of you who have worked with angular 1 or

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,760
angularjs as the angular community likes

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,880
to call it you might have seen that you

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,829
know a lot of the sorts of things that

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,720
happen in angular might have not make as

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,940
much sense to you as things do in

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,150
angular 2 now why would you want to

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,470
choose angular in this case well there's

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,019
a lot of differences that have come

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,180
about between angular 1 or angularjs and

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,889
angular or angular 2 I know it's very

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,690
confusing but bear with me the

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,910
nomenclature is kind of secondary here

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,940
and of course just a few weeks ago at

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,310
ng-conf and and prior to that angular 4

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,109
was just released so this presentation

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,349
in terms of what we're actually building

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:22,940
today

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,090
is

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,920
going to actually be angular 4 so just

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,440
to be have some fair warning there

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,480
however some of the stuff that I will be

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,920
working on and talking about is going to

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,210
be applicable to versions of angular 2x

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,680
now why would you want to choose angular

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,800
well one of the reasons why people chose

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,260
angular back in the pre angular 2 days

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,390
is that it was very flexible and it was

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,860
very easy to get ramped up it was a lot

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,480
like jQuery and that you could really

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,890
easily kind of use it in a very limited

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,500
fashion on a website

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,000
however angular 2 really kind of changes

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,290
this quite a bit one of the things you

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,730
might have noticed if you've looked at

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,010
the documentation or looked at some of

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,170
the angular 2 marketing is that angular

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,900
2 now has its own CLI command line

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,000
interface called angular CLI for obvious

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,830
reasons and it's something that is very

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,410
similar to the ever ecosystem if you've

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,590
worked with ember CLI for instance so

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,990
angular is much more focused now on what

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,880
they call the one framework idea where

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,560
everything and every possible touch

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,900
point of content which means mobile apps

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,110
and web web apps and native apps on

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,380
desktop are all kind of closed up into

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,730
the same single ecosystem in that if you

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,770
build an angular app once you should

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,970
theoretically be able to compile it down

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:40,130
to native desktop native mobile and web

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,320
alright now what about typescript and

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,350
es6 well as some of you probably know

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,940
es6 is the sort of new version of

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,460
JavaScript that's come about in recent

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,310
years otherwise known as es 2015 and

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,900
this version of JavaScript introduces

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,550
some very important sand tactic features

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,960
and some very cool things that I'll talk

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,790
about very briefly during this

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,190
presentation one of the things that you

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,900
might know about es6 is that it requires

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,400
a compile step it requires a build step

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,280
and this is one of the reasons why

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,460
angular CLI is so useful because given

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,590
that angular uses typescript which also

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,900
includes some backported features from

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,790
es6 it's actually quite useful to be

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,680
able to just do the build in a single go

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,020
now what are some of the biggest

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,480
features of typescript when you compare

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,070
it to JavaScript or es6 well the first

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,680
is how many people have worked with like

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,290
type coercion and discussing dynamic

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,510
typing in JavaScript in es5 and

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,250
previously yes so as some of you

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,440
probably know there's such a thing as

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,550
true and false values

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,530
values that evaluate to true or false

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,200
there's also things like truth II or

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,970
falsies values in JavaScript which is

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,590
that I wait to true or false depending

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,150
on a variety of different situations I'm

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,970
not going to go into type coercion right

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,610
now but suffice to say that typescript

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,290
is actually using dynamic typing now it

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,210
was invented by Microsoft so probably

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,940
gives you an idea of why they decided to

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,140
go with static typing so one of the

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,570
things that you'll notice very quickly

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,340
about typescript is that it's kind of

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,960
like JavaScript but it's a little bit

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,550
complicated and I'll show you a little

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,610
bit about some of the things that we're

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,900
talking about as we go through and the

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,180
biggest kind of feature of typescript

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,250
that is well one of one of the most

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,460
important aspects of type scripts is the

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,020
fact that it's great for IDE s so I

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,120
prefer to use the atom code editor which

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,340
I'll be using today and Adam actually

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,010
has a really great package called atom

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,270
typescript if you want to go ahead and

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,490
download it I'll put up the command

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,440
right now in just a second and this

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,170
package says things like code

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,430
highlighting autocomplete linting as

00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,610
well if you install all the dependencies

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,620
and it's really useful and you know

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,030
oftentimes people will say well you know

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,740
I can just write JavaScript and know how

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,910
it works and all this needs to just come

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,900
in a console log everything well

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,900
sometimes we don't really have the

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,550
luxury to do that so what are some of

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,320
the key concepts of angular how many

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,190
people have worked with ember or react

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,110
before ok quite a few of you so angular

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,120
is made up of components and this is

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,190
something that's you know very different

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,600
from M brain react no just kidding it's

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,960
very similar to M brain react in that

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,720
angular is able to provide all of this

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,810
markup in nest of all components and

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,520
these components are also repeatable

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,140
angular is also made of services now

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,910
services if you've ever worked with

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,050
things like ember models are quite

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,820
similar to ember models in that they

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,680
provide data they're meant to be a

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,840
single source of data that can be used

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,240
across multiple components at your

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,740
volition there's also an angular routes

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,599
which is very familiar to people who

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,479
have worked with routing and react and

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,950
angular which is of course the pads and

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,320
the places that you can go in your

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,830
application that map on two different

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,880
sets of components already so one of the

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,589
things that's a little bit interesting

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,600
about this session today is actually

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,420
don't want to use the core REST API I'm

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,680
going to go ahead and use what is

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,930
they contributed kind of de facto

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,209
standard for REST API s and Drupal which

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,550
is JSON API and I think I saw Mateo in

00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:01,410
the audience who is the maintainer and

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,399
what I'm going to do right now is I'm

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,240
just going to go ahead and start setting

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,360
up a Drupal site so one of the things

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,749
that you'll want to do is you know you

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,309
definitely want to create a Drupal site

00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,149
that will work for this and so one of

00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,620
the things I'm going to do is I'm going

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,290
to go ahead and just create a directory

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,850
where I'm going to have my Drupal site

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,850
I'm going to go ahead and get into that

00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:28,920
now the thing that I'm going to do right

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,790
now is clone the git repo and I'm hoping

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,639
that the Internet

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,009
holds up here if not then we'll just see

00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,290
what happens and I'm going to go ahead

00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:40,199
and check out the 8.3 branch because it

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,850
has a lot of really good stuff including

00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,069
of course one of the new features that

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:49,110
came about in recent minor releases of

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:51,269
Drupal called Dru optin core support or

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,439
cross-origin resource sharing so as you

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,790
probably know one of the biggest

00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:57,029
problems that we deal with when we're

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:01,920
doing you know cross-site things namely

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:03,660
things like having to do requests across

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
different domains is that there's an

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,930
issue of cross-origin resource sharing

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,610
which is that you can't actually perform

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,800
requests against another domain unless

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,509
you have the proper permissions now it's

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,089
very clear that this is not working so

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:26,459
I'm going to go ahead and go to my

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:30,750
project here at sea okay okay luckily

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:35,550
I've already got a ready-to-go cloned

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,769
repo here now for those of you who are

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,600
new to this I'm using angular not

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,300
angular aqua has dev desktop to actually

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,179
set this up okay where is it

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,800
uh-oh all right I don't actually have it

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,410
here all right that's fine I'm going to

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,149
go ahead and try cloning it again but in

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,579
the meantime what you might want to do

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,639
is - okay there we go now it's going

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:59,120
alright so any questions so far about

00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,670
angular the angular history of angular

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,400
typescript he has six about me about my

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,200
hair

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,700
about I don't know anyways so one of the

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,880
things that I'll do right now also while

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,410
this is going is to actually show you

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,270
very briefly here if you're using Adam

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,310
one of the really nice things about Adam

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,990
is that you can actually go into

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,060
something like projects and for example

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:27,970
I'm going to just really quickly go into

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:30,460
my existing Drupal site for this and if

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,900
you just go ahead and do Adam dot which

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,430
is a really nice feature of the Adam

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,630
code editor you can just jump right in

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,220
you have all of your directories

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,839
available on the right the entire

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,240
directory structure that you might need

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,830
now one of the things that you might

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,210
find useful is what I mentioned earlier

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,130
which is the the atom the atom package

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,690
for typescript which is really useful

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,790
for autocomplete and things of that

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,230
nature so what I'm going to do is show

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,490
you very quickly right now what that

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,290
command looks like which is a PM install

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,940
atom type script now it is a little bit

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,470
buggy that's one thing I will warn you

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,940
and so if you find that you're getting

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,560
some linting errors that don't make any

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,510
sense to you what I recommend is just

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,950
closing out of the file and reopening

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,360
the file and that usually resolves

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,620
things so alrighty well I think that

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,050
this is going to take a little bit too

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,000
long for me to get this going but we're

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,420
in luck because I actually already have

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,420
a site set up with this going so

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:36,360
for those of you who have used a local

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,250
Drupal dev server it's really useful

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,410
what I recommend you do is to go ahead

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,930
and download the zel module which is

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,920
really useful for these purposes and I'm

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,740
just going to very quickly go through

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,380
what some of those commands look like so

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,810
you want to do thrush download develop

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,610
and enable develop and one of the things

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,500
that's really useful about this is that

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,040
once you actually have dissolve and you

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,200
enable does all generate also is that

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,790
you can actually generate content and

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,830
this is a really easy way to get started

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,450
so if you have drush installed and

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,820
you're ready to go you can go ahead and

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,260
do gently xx and what Gen Z stands for

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,200
is generate content which will generate

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,640
a random set of nodes of multiple

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,650
content types that are available out of

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,420
the box in Drupal namely article and

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,920
basic page and give you what you need if

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,630
you want to generate some users it's

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,550
just genu 20 those are some really

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,260
really nice things now the other thing

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,720
that you'll want to do to get set up is

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,390
to download JSON API and also enable

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,970
JSON API another really nice thing about

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,780
JSON API is that once you enable it

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,070
there's actually very little

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,590
configuration and that's one of the

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,720
things that's really nice about how this

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,620
has this is worth so I'm getting a

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,390
little bit worried about the internet

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,010
here so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,870
going to go ahead and start the process

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,880
and short-circuit this process a little

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,690
bit I'm going to go ahead and give you

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,710
the first steps to setup angular so one

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,130
of the things that you'll want to do is

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,930
to npm install and i used like to set

00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,280
the g flag for global unless you have

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,230
certain reasons that you don't want to

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,060
make this install globally and you want

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,200
to go ahead and do at angular slash CLI

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,120
and this will go ahead and install the

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,220
CLI now with the CLI enables you to do

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,930
is to do things like set up your

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,300
boilerplate directory structure get

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,380
things going very quickly and it's very

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,730
actually you know it's actually a really

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,680
good idea because one of the things that

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,470
you can do very quickly here is just say

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,950
ng new which is very similar to the

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,980
ember CLI command ember new and say okay

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,450
ng new baltimore angular now what this

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,610
is going to do is it's going to go ahead

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,650
and create all of the things that I need

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,880
for my first angular application and the

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,960
reason I'm doing this now because I'm

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,300
really worried about the internet and

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,150
this does take a little bit of time ok

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,860
so let's go back to JSON API now one of

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,640
the things that's really important to

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,760
think about here

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,440
is that after I the navel Jason API what

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,660
you'll find is that if I actually go to

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:56,170
my browser and I go ahead and navigate

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,430
to slash Jason API slash node slash

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:03,280
article with the query parameter string

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:06,010
underscore format equals API underscore

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,510
Jason what you'll find is I've actually

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:14,080
got my nice JSON formatted output from

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,240
this resource the resource is types

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,580
nodes of type article as you can see all

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,650
of my generated nodes are here and ready

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,080
to go now the really nice thing about

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,150
this is that you can do this with pretty

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,590
much any of the major content types of

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,600
course and any content types you set up

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,370
so this is the view for basic pages and

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,340
I've just performed a get request again

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,270
to all of these things now one of the

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,860
things that you'll notice about this

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,720
path up here I don't know it's kind of

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,200
hard to see but it's note slash page

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,760
it's bundle slash type so you want to be

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,760
very careful in that note is a bundle

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,340
and page and article are both types when

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,410
you think about user user has no bundle

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,050
so you actually repeat and you do user

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:56,620
slash user just a little bit of JSON API

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,580
trivia for you okay now the other thing

00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,320
that we're going to really want to do

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,690
with this is to actually make sure that

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,910
we set up course so cross origin

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,290
resource sharing is a big issue now one

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,110
of the things that I've used in the past

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,060
to a great success is Sally young cores

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,550
module but that has now been deprecated

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,460
in favor of opt-in core support that is

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:19,260
available in Drupal 8 now the way you

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:24,850
set that up is you go ahead and go to

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:27,580
sites you go to default and you want to

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,160
go ahead and copy the default services

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,890
yamo file to a new services at yamo file

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,400
now what happens is when I open up this

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:40,210
yamo file what you'll notice is I've got

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,250
a whole lot of key valley or a lot of

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,290
configurations here that I can set and a

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,220
lot of settings that I can set and down

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,320
at the bottom here you'll notice this

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,480
new section if you've been using a

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,370
thought oh and you haven't installed 8.3

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,590
or 8.2 yet now you'll notice that

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,660
there's course config all you got to do

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,230
is able to true and what I've done which

00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,400
I real

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,800
don't recommend you do for security

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,140
reasons it allowed all headers all

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,880
methods all origins which means that you

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,260
can be coming from somewhere across the

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,870
planet and requesting against this

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,790
domain and be able to access the content

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,990
not something I recommend so you'll want

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,360
to give this some thought once you've

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,089
done it but for local purposes for the

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,680
purposes of this kind of a stuff it's

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,050
really easy alright how's it going here

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,420
wow that was awesome how did that work

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,520
okay so now we've got Baltimore angular

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,530
I don't know how the internet like it's

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,650
like weird it's like good and that okay

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:33,400
so now that we've set up course config

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,440
oh also one very crucial thing is after

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,140
you've gone ahead and done course config

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,380
just in case as we know the big old

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,680
mantra in Drupal is always clear the

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,620
cache or rebuild the cache do a cache

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,480
rebuild as we know in Drupal 8 alrighty

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,140
so now we're ready to go

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,230
how many people have made it this far

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,580
awesome ok so here we go so we're going

00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,260
to go ahead and start writing angular

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,560
stuff ooh

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,850
so exciting alright so one of the things

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,230
that I want to do is to just show off

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,880
just a couple of things that you can do

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,010
with the angular CLI right now right off

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,840
with that now obviously what you want to

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,290
do is once you've gotten all of your

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,300
things going you definitely want to try

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:20,740
and make sure that server is working so

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:25,620
the command here is ng serve - - open

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:28,450
which will open a tab in my browser and

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,660
you'll get a nice little hello world

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,660
message

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,490
Oh first I have to compile app works

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,030
we're done we're done all right bye no

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm just kidding

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,920
okay so the next thing that we're going

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,750
to want to do is to go ahead and say

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,980
okay well if that's awesome we've got

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:54,680
all of our stuff here and we go ahead

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,840
and just navigate back out to project go

00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:02,390
ahead and open this up and Adam so you

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:05,300
can see so all right let's see Shazam

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,470
Bo's okay so in the source directory SRC

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,780
we're going to go ahead and be working

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,160
primarily in the app directory now one

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,100
of the things that you'll notice once

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,300
you initialize your first angular

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,980
application is what's really nice is

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,830
that it creates a git repo for you right

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,420
off the bat which is really nice and one

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,429
thing you'll notice is that we've got

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,350
these interesting files now this file

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,750
that I just clicked on is app dot

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,940
components TS and the extension of

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,010
course for typescript is PS I am

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,809
probably wondering what on earth is all

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,730
of this weird stuff here I don't even

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,040
know like this is I mean I'm used to

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,500
stuff like you know immediately invoked

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,790
function expressions and stuff well just

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,410
to be very clear here and I don't want

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,660
to get too much into typescript you can

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,220
look up this stuff when we're done here

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,170
and it's out of scope of this but at

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,880
component is an example of a decorator

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,010
function and we also have of course

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,570
exports and imports which are the ways

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,770
that es6 modules function so okay let's

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,820
get started here that's all kind of

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,140
secondary we don't need to know all of

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,160
that for right now because what we're

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,110
going to start off with right off the

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,580
bat is to just say alright let's change

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,830
the title because I just want to make

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,450
sure that I know what's going on here so

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,309
I'm going to say Baltimore angular go

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,260
ahead and save this and of course what's

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,450
nice is that if I go back to Drupal it's

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,040
our natural sorry Google Chrome it's

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,960
already changed it for me because it

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,670
compiles and does everything live and so

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,559
live development is a really key feature

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,610
of a lot of JavaScript frameworks these

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,050
days and it's very useful okay now one

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,580
of the things that I also want to do

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,230
next is to go ahead and start to fill in

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,309
the initial application because there's

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,840
some stuff that we want to be able to

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,470
see now what we're going to build today

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,080
is a very simple content browser and

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,059
it's going to be dealing with articles

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,429
so just you know know the type article

00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,020
and you know we're going to try to get

00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,590
through a lot of the topics of angular

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,870
at the same time that I try

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,039
to build this application both only one

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,580
of those things are very likely to

00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,840
happen so we'll see how far we get so

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,880
one of the things that you'll want to do

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,279
is to go ahead just to start off right

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,960
up of that is to declare some

00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,570
information about what we're actually

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,580
doing the first is I want to make sure

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,070
that angular is aware of the fact that

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,070
I'm going to be working with a type of a

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,409
type known as article now what I do is

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,590
I'm going to create a class here which

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:17,610
is export class article now one of the

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,980
things I'm going to do right now is

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,210
because I'm not really sure about what

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,100
the data looks like and I don't really

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,539
want to rely on data to begin with

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,679
because I still have to connect the you

00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,570
know connect dots between Drupal and

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,059
angular but for now I'm just going to

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,740
declare some dummy types here now this

00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,710
is one of the things that you'll notice

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,049
about typescript is that it's of course

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,960
you know very strict on making sure that

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,820
you have definitions of these types and

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,890
of course what I'm going to do now is

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,289
what I actually export this component I

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,360
want to make sure that one of the things

00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:52,380
that I'm going to export alongside it is

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,980
an article with some of this information

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,440
filled in so I'm going to have title

00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:02,899
just call it article number one for now

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:06,240
and of course lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,630
saying okay so on so forth anyways so

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,490
I'm going to go ahead and save this and

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:15,750
OH sale to compile okay and of course

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:21,179
because we have an issue here where they

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,549
expected a comma C here no no not quite

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:27,090
hang on there we go yep got it thank you

00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:31,470
very much my eyes are bothering me and

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:33,690
as you can see it's still not working so

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,000
one thing I'm going to do is go into

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,799
here and say Oh unexpected value app

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,140
component declared by the module app

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:43,140
module now one of the things that you'll

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,970
notice is that angular requires a lot of

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,610
awareness of everything and one of the

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,640
things that needs like godlike awareness

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,590
over everything is the angular app

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,360
module and that's kind of like the king

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,679
that governs every single thing and

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,419
makes sure that everything is aware of

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,470
everything and so what I'm going to do

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,200
for now is I'm going to just pause this

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:05,019
and not do any previews right now and

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm going to go ahead and just do a

00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,470
couple of different things here the

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,269
first thing I'm going to do is to set up

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,399
a root template which is going to be our

00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:13,809
HTML right here I'm just going to go

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:19,000
ahead and just do this

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:22,419
oh no typos are so bad and just put some

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,690
very rudimentary template information in

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,690
here

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,000
and this is going to be like just very

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,590
simple now you're probably wondering

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,299
what on earth is this that I'm doing

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:39,549
right now so what this is doing is

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,500
actually this ngmodel

00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:43,720
attribute thingy same thing with the

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,879
square brackets and the parentheses and

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,919
and all that stuff that is actually

00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:49,090
setting up what's called two-way

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,399
data-binding how many people know what

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,330
two-way data-binding is okay so that's

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,559
good

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,129
and so what's going to happen is that

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,950
when I actually modify this right inside

00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:03,669
this HTML here I'm actually going to

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,590
make sure that it's bound to the data

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,820
that's showing up above it now I know

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,049
that's very unclear right now but I'll

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,720
show you what that looks like in a

00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:13,240
second now the other thing that I'm

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,940
going to do right now is to go ahead and

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,879
make sure that we have everything here

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,070
okay everything's good to go that's good

00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,840
a fit up that I thought that uh okay see

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,250
how things look now still not working

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,169
okay app component declared but okay so

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,519
I'm going to go and check in here and

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:33,429
see what's going on here okay I've

00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,750
component Doug - yes okay all right well

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,629
let's just keep moving on for a second

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,549
so now the other thing I'm going to do

00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:41,080
right now is set up some dummy content

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,490
dummy content some dummy data because

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,559
I'm not ready quite yet to connect

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:49,059
Drupal to angular so what I'm going to

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,820
do is I'm going to go and create let's

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,440
see here okay so I've got that I'm going

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,350
to go ahead and create some data that

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,600
can be used here so what you want to do

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,059
is now that I've got my class definition

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,759
here of article I'm going to go ahead

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,740
and also set up a constant now for those

00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,590
of you who don't know in bs6

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,059
there's a new keyword the Const keyword

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,369
which allows you to set up a constant

00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,390
which is basically immutable and I'm

00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:17,440
going to go ahead and set up

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,240
a constant notice articles of type

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,429
article right so this is saying I'm

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,990
going to this is going to be an array of

00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:28,840
articles right and I'm going to go ahead

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:34,270
and just put in stuff like oh I D one

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:36,940
title article one body article number

00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,100
one body and so on so forth and this

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,390
will continue on for quite some time I'm

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:46,020
just going to do this very quickly here

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:46,020
and just set up maybe three or five okay

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,559
all right now what's going to happen

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,630
next here is that I will go ahead and

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,419
make sure that this is all good to go

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,950
now one of the other things that you'll

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,330
notice is that there's a lot of arrows

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,770
showing up here and one of the big

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,790
reasons is because actually this is

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,429
quite buggy so I'm going to actually

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,720
reopen this and as you can see the

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,710
errors have vanished so if you do oh

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:21,760
well never mind

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:23,200
they're still there okay so uh nope nope

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,179
that's not you're always episode right

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,000
here thank you very much this is why you

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:30,340
don't do live coding sessions alright

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,840
next thing I'm going to do is down here

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,460
I'm going to replace this and say you

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,549
know what actually I want to go ahead

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,590
and export my articles as well which is

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:41,470
going to be this constant with all these

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,510
dummy articles in there okay

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,990
now the next thing that's going to

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,010
happen is we've got this interesting

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,570
two-way binding tweeds out of binding

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,890
going on here but actually what I want

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,410
to do is I want to provide a list of

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:55,600
these articles right away right off of

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,150
that so I'm going to go ahead and just

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,970
add in a couple of things here caps lock

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,070
is on my articles and I realize I'm

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,940
already running short on time so I may

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,830
need to skip ahead a little bit but I'm

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,470
going to just show off right here one of

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,450
these attributes that article of

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,570
articles now what this is going to do is

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,370
this is going to go ahead and loop

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,620
through and iterate over all of the

00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:25,809
articles that I've declared within my

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,340
within that constant definition and is

00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:30,370
going to actually display

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,410
each one as a list item now some of you

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,700
might have seen this kind of similar

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,430
syntax before when you're working with

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,370
angular 1 in that you know you have

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:41,200
these excuse me and that you have ways

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,800
of looping and doing all sorts of nice

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,630
things with with angular so next thing

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,070
that we're going to do is I'm just going

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,080
to check and I'm going to probably need

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,030
to debug this right now please add a

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:57,460
pipe like this oh I think I know what's

00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:59,820
going on okay let's see here that's

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:07,690
compiling successfully but there's no

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:10,780
let's see anyone's got any questions

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:15,970
right now or after that okay

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,440
good no questions yet not sure why this

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,150
isn't working right now but I'm just

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,100
going to move on because I'd rather show

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,150
you the code rather than and I'll show

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,840
you the end finished product once we're

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,400
done don't worry but the next thing that

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,060
I want to do is to go ahead and issue

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,230
and provide a click event handler now

00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,570
what this is going to do is that when I

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,860
click on an article on the list of

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,780
articles that I'm going to have it's

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,210
going to actually show the article down

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,220
below in that nice little form that I've

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,740
just built such that when I click on an

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,690
article here this down here this form is

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,540
going to change to reflect that article

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,630
so what I'm going to do next is I'm

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,990
going to go ahead and add an on select

00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:00,670
event to this so what I'll do is I'll go

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:06,250
back to my template here and go ahead

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:09,550
and make sure that I provide an event

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:14,110
handler here which is going to be on

00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:17,200
select article now what this is going to

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,610
do is that this right here this on

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,460
select method is going to need to be

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,990
added to the app component but right now

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,300
what's going to happen is that this on

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,740
select indication here is going to call

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,010
a method that we haven't quite yet

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,440
declared yet in this component script

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,090
file type script file so what I'm going

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,960
to need to do now is of course to

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:42,160
provide that information to types

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,020
and so what you'll notice is that of

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,580
course we've got oh I think I know

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,910
what's going on here this is actually

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,500
supposed to be done here and I think

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,780
that might have actually solved the

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,990
problem whoo

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,500
okay I solved the problem all right oh

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,530
thank goodness

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,810
all right lucky lucky break okay all

00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,310
right so now the next thing that I

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,430
really need to do here is to make sure

00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,930
that I have underneath here and on

00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,970
select method but there's a couple of

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,470
things that are missing right what's

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,080
happening is that right now this article

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,850
array has members of type article which

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,620
is the dummy variable that I've just

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,180
provided now eventually what's going to

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,710
happen is that this list of article is

00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,330
going to come from a web service namely

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,210
Drupal but for now I'm just going to

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:28,330
display some some mock some just a mock

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,800
content here now in the exported

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,130
component here we're going to need to

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,560
actually put in a some information about

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,880
this kind of stuff that we're about to

00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,410
do namely we're going to need a couple

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,140
of different things the first is a

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,390
property called selected article and

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,960
we're going to want to make sure that it

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,340
has the type of article now as you can

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,230
see one of the really kind of like

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,370
annoying and really disgusting things

00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,260
about typescript which is one of the

00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,300
reasons why I don't like it is that you

00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,550
can really mess up with equal signs and

00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,020
semicolons and colons and all this stuff

00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,280
because you're defining type at the same

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,620
time that you're defining values and

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,390
that can be really annoying sometimes so

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,710
that's part of the reason why some of

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,270
those mistakes happened earlier because

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,370
honestly if you look at it something I

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,170
don't know it just looks semicolons look

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,830
like like equal signs to me I don't know

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,580
but anyways what we're going to do here

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,700
is we're going to go ahead and declare

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:21,430
and one of the nice things also is that

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,040
when you actually create a method you

00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:25,990
can also define the type that you expect

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,410
in that method as the argument right off

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,420
the bat

00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,740
so with es6 what you can do is you can

00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,210
get you know you can have default values

00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,080
right that's one of the nice things you

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,120
can do in es6

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,560
well of course in typescript also you

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,030
can have a default types as well now the

00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,920
next thing I'm going to do here is go

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,930
ahead and say okay when you have this

00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,350
selected article it's going to become

00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:50,900
article right and this article is going

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:54,210
to come from this argument way over here

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,620
right there so just to be very clear

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,940
here what's happening here is that I'm

00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,280
going through and iterating all my

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,530
articles when I click on an article then

00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,260
argument of article is going to be

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,270
passed back and of course go through

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,330
here undergo type checking and then

00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,720
become assigned to this dot selected

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,580
article so with me cool

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,980
all right so the next thing I'm going to

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,830
do is I'm going to find this new

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,900
selected article property instead of

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,760
buying to that selected article property

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,720
instead of binding to article and so

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,150
what I'm going to do here is I'm going

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,070
to go back here and say okay well you

00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,860
know what I'm going to change this to be

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,450
selected article I'm going to change

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:39,680
this to be also select the article and

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,800
what's going to happen here is that

00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,840
okie-dokie

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,630
oh yeah one thing I forgot to do is also

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,640
add an ID field as well because I want

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:51,540
to do that now you can imagine what this

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,960
is going to look like when you actually

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,340
go through the and actually connected

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,110
stuff to Drupal now some of you are

00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,620
probably going well a little wait wait

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,240
wait wait

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,790
but what about like the attributes

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,250
object in JSON API and all that I'll get

00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,900
there I'll get there but the next thing

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,600
that I'm going to do is actually go

00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,090
ahead and do the following when there's

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,400
no article selected I want the form not

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,870
to show right so what I want to do is

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,390
when you go to the page for the first

00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,590
time right so for example if I go here

00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,600
if I go to this page for the first time

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,520
and I see these things and I click on

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,050
one of them I want this form to show up

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,630
this form right here but I don't want it

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:30,390
to show up beforehand so what I'm going

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:33,420
to do is I'm going to go ahead and

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,460
create an if statement now once again

00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,040
just like what I did with this control

00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,770
structure ish thing up here is the exact

00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,480
same thing is surrounded with a div and

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,620
I know I'm glad Morton's not in the room

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,870
because you'd probably be really mad at

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,090
me for using all these did but I'm going

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,330
to say if selected article right so if

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:55,260
it is a selected article is going to be

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:59,580
here then show this information here

00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,260
right okay now in the future we're going

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,850
to want to style this and do a lot of

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,400
CSS but I don't really have time for

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,860
that

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,630
so what I'm going to do just to make

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,310
sure that in the future my friend

00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,710
developer doesn't you know come and

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,419
really get mad at me and you know

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,970
threaten to take away my beer I'm going

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,169
to go ahead and put in here okay I'm

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,929
going to put in the class for you just

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:21,580
to make sure that you're happy and when

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,950
you style it you're going to be okay and

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,889
of course the most important thing here

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,870
is to so as to show that when this

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,970
article is equivalent to selected

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,370
article that's when you provide this

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,500
class okay

00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,990
everyone still with me and as you can

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,310
see what I am alright let me put you

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,389
just that was too fast let me show this

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:45,610
again okay Shazam bows right now also

00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,889
what's really cool is if I click on

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,490
article number three and this is how

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,169
two-way data-binding works if I go it

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,129
actually updates everywhere right and

00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,600
that's one of the nice things about

00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,040
two-way data-binding

00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,420
there's some disadvantages and

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,150
advantages of two-way data-binding which

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,530
I'll go over I want to have to go over

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,410
but if you want to come and talk to me

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:08,440
afterwards and go over that okay so next

00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,960
thing I'm going to do is to go ahead and

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,330
split up this app into several different

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,610
files all of this right now has been

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:19,750
happening in a single file known as app

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,070
component dot T s not HTML dot - yes now

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,150
this is all well and good but the

00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,650
problem is that once you want to

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,090
actually do a lot more work with this

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,220
stuff and add more components and do a

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,810
lot of really crazy stuff and for

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,310
example add pages to this content

00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,370
browser that we're building we're going

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,170
to need to split this up into components

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,760
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,680
take all of this stuff right here the

00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,090
select the article stuff here and put it

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,060
off into a separate component called

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,200
article detail now the way that this

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,330
works is I'm going to go ahead and

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,000
create a new file called and this is how

00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:52,060
by the way nomenclature works for

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,060
components in angular 2 is that you have

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:58,690
to do the name of the component and then

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,420
dot component dot TS so I created a file

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,330
called article detail dot component dot

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,070
TS now one of the things that you'll

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,200
notice is that the file name here is

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,830
article detail in point of that - yes

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,280
right

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,050
but oh gosh you know ok see sometimes

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,650
it's nice sometimes it's not anyway so

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,630
but actually

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,559
going to be known in the angular scape

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,930
is article detail components as you saw

00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,270
if we go back here you see that it's app

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,369
component same exact story it's going to

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,109
be article detail components so just in

00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,510
case capitalization is a little bit

00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:34,770
confusing here alrighty so what's the

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,660
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,799
to go ahead and do the following first

00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,079
of all I'm going to do the same thing

00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:41,549
I'm going to go ahead and get a makes

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,770
people aware that this is going to be

00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:46,170
the same exact kind of component as what

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:49,529
happens in the rest of angular world

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,890
which is to import this from angular

00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:56,849
slash core awesome next I'm going to go

00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:59,460
ahead and invoke decorator and say ok

00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:04,970
the selector is article detail this is

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:07,619
how it's going to be known in the actual

00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,910
as an element right so if you have

00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,980
worked with custom elements before and

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,859
web components or with ember before in

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,839
terms of ember components this selector

00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:19,260
is going to be how this is going to be

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,680
known ok so the next thing that I want

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,809
to do is to make sure to go ahead and

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,160
export this out as article detail

00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:32,400
component ok our component has been

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,619
built but we're missing now the template

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,970
so as you saw there's actually a couple

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,779
of different ways to do templates in

00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:43,950
angular the first is you can declare

00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:45,450
within your component decorator here you

00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,099
can actually say I want to have a

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,210
template URL what I'm going to do

00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,640
instead is I'm going to use a really

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:53,880
nifty feature available now in es6 which

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,589
is multi-line strings and you surround

00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,970
multi-line strings by using backticks so

00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:59,039
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,829
ok well I've got my selector here and I

00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,270
also want to add a template this

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:05,819
template can be started by backticks

00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,410
awesome and I'm going to go ahead and

00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,000
put in a template here so I'm going to

00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:13,319
say let's go ahead and just take this

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,529
mess here right and just stick it in

00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,529
here

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:25,490
go ahead and save that perfect now the

00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,110
really interesting thing here is that it

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,340
still says selected article but the

00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,600
thing is I want this component to be

00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,310
pretty generic right I don't necessarily

00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,470
want it to be very tied to this idea of

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,180
having to have a selected article so

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,230
what I'm going to go ahead and do here

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,090
is actually I'm going to take this and

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,690
generalize it a little bit such that

00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:46,310
this is known instead as just a plain

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,200
old article because in the end I might

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,260
want to make this a page or something

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,690
else or you know so on so forth so I've

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:57,410
done that and the next things I'm going

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:59,000
to do is to go ahead and add the part

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,680
the article property to this export

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,600
component here such that it'll make

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,120
everything else in angular aware of

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:10,100
what's going on so I'm going to add this

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:13,130
to there and what's going to happen here

00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,260
is that I have a cannot find name

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,870
necessarily because what's going on here

00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,700
is that I actually don't have any way of

00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,680
knowing what an article is from this

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,630
point right there is no awareness I

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,360
haven't decided to find a class of

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,980
article in this file here so what I need

00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,420
to do is I need to actually split out

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,740
this thing and by the way what I'm going

00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,560
to do right now is go ahead and replace

00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,810
this with that selector so that's

00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,400
elected with article detail article

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,840
detail article detail very nice okay now

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,200
the thing I need to do is to go ahead

00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:47,720
and go back here and split out this

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,370
definition so that it can be used by a

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,500
whole variety of different people so I'm

00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,410
just going to go ahead and cut this out

00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:57,790
save this and put it into another file

00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:01,130
which is going to have this information

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:03,230
now what I'm going to do is save this

00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,150
and oops you know I don't want to do

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,230
that I want to save actually if I do I

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,730
do that

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,500
I want to go ahead and save it as just

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,690
article that TS because it contains a

00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,330
nice definition here Oh what this is

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,680
going to my old version of this that I

00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,300
already have working so I'm going to go

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,920
here here here there we go save that now

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,890
you're probably noticing right now oh

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,480
well there's no article type existing

00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,860
here so of course for those of you who

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,300
work with es6 the force is very familiar

00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,520
which is

00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,650
doing this and what we're doing here is

00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,320
we're actually adding and importing this

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,300
module which is the angular type the

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,190
sort of the article type definition to

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,230
this and then of course what I'm going

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,270
to do after this is do the same thing

00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,070
over here in my component because both

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,430
of these have to be aware of what's

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,430
going on

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:56,490
perfect all right now next thing I'm

00:40:53,850 --> 00:41:00,150
going to do is to go ahead and make sure

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:02,700
that our root component is going to have

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,560
to indicate to this article detail

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,330
component which article to display and

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,310
the way that's going to work is that I

00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,620
want to make sure somehow to tie that

00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,780
idea of a selected article back to the

00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,640
article that I'm using in my component

00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,410
template and so the way I'm going to

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,020
actually do that is to provide that

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:23,520
information by using essentially a

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,490
what's called a property binding

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,840
expression so how this works is I'm

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,940
going to go in here and as you saw I

00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,220
just added in this custom element that I

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,390
just created but I want to add in an

00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,830
attribute I'm going to pass in a

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,690
property right this is very similar to

00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,830
those we work with reactor with ember

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,200
which is I'm gonna pass in this property

00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,600
and say well this is actually going to

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,270
be equivalent to selected article right

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,740
so just to be very clear here what's

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,790
going on here is that I'm going here the

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,310
selected article that's available here

00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,110
is now going to pass through here and be

00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,230
made available to this other component

00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:57,930
sitting over here has article right just

00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,740
2d office gate things a little bit very

00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:03,060
nice now the square brackets here are

00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,410
very crucial because they actually mean

00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,500
that the article property that's

00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,530
contained within here is a target of the

00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,910
property binding expression that we saw

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,810
back here so this target is so in our in

00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,160
our detail component we're gonna

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,840
actually have to include something else

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,620
and I'm going to explain very shortly

00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,120
why that is over here in my component

00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,180
template I'm going to go ahead and make

00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:31,440
sure to include also the input symbol

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,720
from angular core now what's going to be

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,150
able to happen here is that once I to

00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,820
bind this right to bind this input to

00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,650
the target what I'm going to have to do

00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,150
is to actually once I actually do the X

00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,690
to the export here

00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,750
use another decorator and now those two

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,160
things are bound together now an angular

00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,470
one thing to keep in mind is that you

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,730
can only have one component for module

00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,070
you can't declare multiple components in

00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,200
a single module and as I said earlier

00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,790
app module PS and let me just make sure

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,550
that things are still working here no

00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:06,510
they're not okay all right well fun

00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,920
stuff okay ah this is the reason why

00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,470
because I haven't declared it in my

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,060
module yet so one of the things that I

00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,790
talked about earlier was this godlike

00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:16,260
thing known as the app module right so

00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,060
the thing that you have to be aware of

00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,740
is when you're actually doing this you

00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:25,110
need to make sure to make it aware of

00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:27,840
every single component that's in your in

00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:33,740
your application which means you have to

00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:41,340
add all of these things here article

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:43,140
details component okay and then we've

00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,890
done that great good to go and actually

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,690
this is interesting because you could

00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,680
actually set up the bootstrap to come in

00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,710
from another component which is really

00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,170
nice okay now what's going to happen

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,060
here is now this should be resolved yes

00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,500
it is because what we've done here is

00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,900
we've made the article detail component

00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,700
have awareness across the makes the app

00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,290
aware of the article detail component

00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,180
100% now which means that we're not

00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,220
going to have bugs appear saying what

00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,740
the heck is this article detail thing I

00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:15,240
have no idea what it is okay so okay so

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,980
the next thing that I want to do now is

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:23,130
to also make sure to go ahead and move

00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,330
on to services so this was components it

00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,030
was a very quick and dirty introduction

00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,170
now with the service well as you saw one

00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,940
of the things that's a big problem here

00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,570
is that we're declaring our dummy data

00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,400
directly inside our route app component

00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,740
this is the overarching app component

00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,380
here and that's okay but I actually want

00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,090
to provide it through a service so

00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,800
component should be declaring their zone

00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,210
data right especially if that data to

00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,980
use across multiple place you can

00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,660
declare data in a component as we've

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,070
done here but if you want to make sure

00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,050
that that's accessible to others to

00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,960
other components as well you want to use

00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,740
a service in angular so we want to make

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,780
sure

00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,700
that we have an article service that

00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,770
provides articles to components so I'm

00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,869
going to do is I'm going to create a new

00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:07,619
file here called

00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:09,630
article service TS and what the service

00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:13,500
is going to do is actually going to

00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:16,140
provide I'm just going to put in some of

00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,680
this temporary stuff here and one of the

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:24,020
things that it's going to provide is

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,020
this data out to everyone who needs it

00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,650
eventually right we're going to want to

00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,330
use Eclair we're going to eventually

00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,130
want to use them use a method called get

00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,350
articles to get all the articles w-want

00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:38,119
so I'm going to just leave that empty

00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:40,980
for right now but I want to go ahead and

00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,140
cut out this dummy data into a separate

00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,580
file right and if you've done other

00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,660
tutorials we're using dummy data you

00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,970
probably notice that they use that they

00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,080
all are exported to different files so

00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:53,540
what I do is I'm gonna just cut this all

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,690
out save that also create a new file

00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:00,380
oops

00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:03,119
yeah called just dummy articles for now

00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,890
paste that in there and of course what I

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,630
want to make sure that is it's aware of

00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,030
it first it's going to be the export of

00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,580
the module and of course also I'm going

00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:15,330
to make sure to make it aware of the

00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:19,170
type that is coming from my article ts

00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:22,640
file great now the other thing that I

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:26,160
want to do is to include this articles

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,380
list in the exported app component here

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,850
right because now it's not aware because

00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,010
right now I have no idea where this is

00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,490
and so what I'm going to do is actually

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:41,100
go ahead and declare this as a type like

00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,940
this there we go and now cannot find

00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,680
MAME articles

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:47,250
oh yes so the other thing that I really

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,980
want to make sure it's do is to also

00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:54,060
provide those these dummy variables out

00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:56,190
to my article service so what I'm gonna

00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:02,820
do in my service is to import article

00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:05,820
here article import also the dummy's

00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,950
variable here from you guessed it Tommy

00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,950
very dummy articles

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:14,760
and that should be coming through just

00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:18,660
fine okay then what I'm going to do is

00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,280
over here I'm going to say okay it's

00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,730
going to have be past something a type

00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,549
article and it's going to have to return

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,990
articles now we can use this article

00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:29,790
service anywhere that we want to in our

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,859
application as long as we import it into

00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:34,650
our components so we want to start off

00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:36,150
by doing that with here so I want to say

00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:41,819
okay let's go ahead and do article

00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:46,740
service from article dodge service good

00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:49,020
to go and here okay now the other thing

00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:55,410
that I really want to make sure to have

00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:58,770
here is a is to use dependency injection

00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,480
to add a private article service

00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,220
property now the reason I'm doing this

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,099
is because we don't necessarily want to

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,559
make sure that when you need an article

00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,329
at any given point and you need to get

00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,920
data at any given point that that

00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:12,869
dependency isn't always present you want

00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,940
to inject it so what's going to happen

00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:17,640
is that I'm going to add this and noted

00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,990
as a injection destination with a

00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,329
constructor now I know this is really

00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,280
really like heady stuff right now but

00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:25,230
just bear with me here what I'm going to

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,710
do here is I'm going to just say okay

00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:32,609
give me a constructor function here and

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,710
it's going to be a type of article

00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:39,720
service it's because just be an empty

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:41,670
constructor for now okay now the other

00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,770
things that and that's the reason why

00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:46,980
that's nothing sounds okay now the thing

00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:50,040
that I'm going to do also is to say that

00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,780
we need to provide this to our module

00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,819
because once again our module is not

00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,530
aware of any of this stuff right so in

00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:57,809
the providers here providers is

00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,390
synonymous in this case just to be very

00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:03,030
easy going here to be is actually

00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,750
synonymous with this idea of article

00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:12,569
service so when I actually provide this

00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:17,450
I will give my data sorry one second

00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:17,450
here I will make sure that our

00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:24,430
are yes article service yes I need to

00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,570
make sure also that our module has

00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,560
article service as well

00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:31,060
so that's going to happen right here

00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,710
okay I am running out of time

00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,180
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,830
skip ahead a little bit just to show you

00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,570
what's going on because I do want to get

00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,750
to a couple of other things before I

00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:42,850
finish um the thing that I'm going to do

00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,960
is go ahead and just open up the

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,440
application that I've been working with

00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,800
here and just show you what this looks

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,680
like

00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,680
let me just exit out of this here okay

00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:02,320
okay

00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:04,180
now I start so what I'm going to do is

00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,310
go to this application that I've already

00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:10,450
built here and okay it's compiling

00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,590
that's the one issue with typescript is

00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,420
you always have to compile and you

00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,650
always have to wait a little bit but

00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:18,490
it's nice because it doesn't every

00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:20,380
single time okay so now you've noticed

00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,150
here this is our finished product so

00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,859
what I'm going to do is because this was

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,270
a little bit too much content I'm going

00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:27,310
to go ahead and make sure that I give

00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:30,600
this to you as both flights all of this

00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:32,530
coding that I've done so far and also

00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,730
provide you with the code base at the

00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,080
very end of this but I want to go

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,820
through a couple of different things and

00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,460
show you what's going on here so it's

00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,470
very clear but just to show you what's

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,970
going on here as you can see I've got a

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,619
nice little browser of all of my

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,600
different articles that have been going

00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:47,980
on here and these are their note IDs

00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,080
which is that I generated when I

00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,660
actually did this generation of content

00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:57,730
now I'm going to go ahead and open this

00:50:52,660 --> 00:51:04,570
up in my atom editor because I want to

00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:07,810
show you what's going on so what's

00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,770
happening here is I have my and let me

00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,450
just close out of some of these things

00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:15,670
here what's going on here is I've got my

00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:17,830
root component which is my articles

00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:21,670
component and what's happening is that

00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:24,790
I'm using basically in here I've got a

00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,080
method which is get articles what does

00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,880
get articles is doing is it's

00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,490
subscribing to what's called an

00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,750
observable variable and an observable is

00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,640
basically a variable

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,440
you can subscribe to it's just like a

00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,050
consistent stream it's kind of like the

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,130
next logical evolution from promises for

00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,890
a lot of people it's still very

00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,330
controversial but one of the things that

00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,220
happens is I've added in this method

00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,260
which is ng on in it so whenever it

00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,900
initializes whenever angular initializes

00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,720
I will get all of my articles right

00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,640
after that then when I select an article

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,950
they will go ahead and give me what I

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,510
need so the other thing I want to show

00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,130
you very briefly here is some of the

00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,390
templates here we've got our templates

00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,560
all filled in this is exactly the same

00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,119
thing that you've seen before with a

00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,420
slight difference which is this right

00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,910
here

00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,470
now I don't necessarily I did a kind of

00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,330
a bad thing here which is that I didn't

00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,980
really think very clearly enough about

00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,680
how the data was going to look in JSON

00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,359
API before I connected its Drupal and so

00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,560
I made a mistake which is that I really

00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:18,880
shouldn't necessarily be relying on dot

00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,490
attributes here unless I'm planning to

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,950
have also relationships and other things

00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:27,400
that are contained within the sort of

00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:30,160
first level of that object of that

00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,470
resource object to be used here in this

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,599
template as well but just to show you

00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,830
what's going on what's good you know

00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,220
what's happening here is I've got my

00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:40,210
article service - yes and if I had gone

00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,550
through all of this I would have gotten

00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:45,730
to this point as you can see here I'm

00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:48,940
actually providing a URL here which is

00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:51,220
exactly as you would expect the route to

00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,570
Drupal now this is not very principled

00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,359
because it's just limiting it to the

00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:58,540
node slash article object and so this is

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,040
not actually very extensible but it does

00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,540
actually do it very well because what

00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,920
you can see is that it's doing all of

00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,260
the handling of all of the observable

00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,560
stuff extracting out the data giving us

00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:12,490
what we need and when I actually go to

00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:16,869
my components here we've seen that

00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:19,780
before and when I go to look at what's

00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:22,080
going on later on you can see that in my

00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:27,030
templates I'm actually going ahead and

00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,990
digging deeply into those actual

00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:31,060
attributes and digging into those

00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:33,940
objects so that's how we're actually

00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,200
building this right now and I just want

00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,369
to finish here because I only have four

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,260
minutes and if you have any questions

00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:40,630
please do come and talk to me afterwards

00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,960
about this one of the things I do want

00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:45,130
to do as I finish off here is to just

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,930
talk about a couple of different things

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:51,850
which is that angular is obviously very

00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,340
rich there's a lot going on there were a

00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:57,700
lot of terms that are probably very

00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:00,250
familiar to still and one of the things

00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,900
that I do believe is that you know this

00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,800
is actually a very interesting approach

00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,120
to client-side and server-side things in

00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,310
general because one of the nice things

00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,500
about angular is that you can actually

00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,620
execute it server side or client side

00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,360
using nodejs and that is of course the

00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,370
definition of what isomorphic or

00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,990
universal javascript is which is this

00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,590
idea of sharing rendering code across

00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:25,420
client and server now some of you may

00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,430
know me from the community as being

00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,190
somebody who has historically advocated

00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,980
for a change and an evolution in the way

00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:34,210
that we think about drupal and one of

00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,160
the things that Drupal 8 is really good

00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,440
at as you just saw and as you've seen in

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,530
many other presentations this week is

00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:44,350
that Drupal is really eminently great at

00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:47,430
providing data at being a Content

00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:49,630
repository at being a content service

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,760
one thing that it has also historically

00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,220
been really good at is providing a nice

00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,520
editorial experience and a very nice UX

00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,570
for all of these things now one of the

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,460
big questions that I think we're going

00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:03,580
to have to answer is a lot of people are

00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,800
moving towards this kind of paradigm and

00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,960
there's there's been there was a blog

00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,600
post recently that argued that we've

00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,610
reached peak Drupal that we're now over

00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,960
this kind of peak and I know some of you

00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,850
disagree with that I disagree with that

00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,720
personally because I think the best days

00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:20,410
of Drupal are still ahead

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,850
but I think there's a very important set

00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,380
of things that are going on in Drupal

00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,630
that need to occur and meet to be

00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,220
accelerated one of them for instance is

00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:30,400
the current effort to convert all of our

00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:33,190
JavaScript in Drupal core over to es6

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,110
and to use an es6 build process the

00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,940
reason why is because a lot of people

00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:38,470
are now building client-side interfaces

00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,480
and client-side applications solely

00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,560
using javascript and many people

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,530
actually don't even really think about

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,300
HTML and CSS or twig for instance

00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:49,360
when they think about writing a

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:51,730
client-side interface or application so

00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,110
I've seen and heard a lot of people

00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,460
talking about well you know I really

00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,250
want to provide a really interesting

00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,750
editorial interface for Drupal and I

00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,640
really want to provide an interesting

00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,640
new approach in the same way that

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,770
calypso used we at WordPress used we act

00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,410
to provide this new Calypso user

00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,000
interface and one of the things that's

00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,890
really interesting is of course you know

00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,170
about a year ago I proposed that we

00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:19,359
adopt a framework in Drupal and I still

00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:23,050
believe that and the reason why is

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:25,090
because we need to figure out the future

00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:27,760
of drupal's front-end in a way that

00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:31,810
makes sense for Drupal future overall

00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,190
and I want to be very clear here even if

00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,520
we adopt the framework whether it's

00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,570
angular ember react view whatever even

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,700
if we were to adopt a JavaScript

00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:41,470
framework we can still be the same

00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,109
Drupal that we've always been we can be

00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:46,420
it can be indistinguishable to the user

00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,490
in the same way that to a content editor

00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,700
WordPress Calypso is indistinguishable

00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:54,849
to them from a WordPress PHP based

00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,890
interface when I say angular plus drupal

00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:58,420
equals rupal I'm saying that any

00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,910
front-end that you decide to put in

00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:04,510
front of true poll can be something that

00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:06,550
works with the whole brand of Drupal I

00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,290
made the same argument in Dublin when I

00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,160
said that ember plus Drupal could also

00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:13,150
be Drupal and I still believe that today

00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,440
one of the things that's really tough

00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,849
right now is that the Java chip

00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,520
landscape is becoming very fragmented

00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,200
and I've always been very fragmented but

00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,820
one thing that I do believe and one

00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,240
thing that I do believe very strongly is

00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:27,310
that without a significant evolution in

00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,070
the way that we think about Drupal in

00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:32,950
this context the better off we'll be in

00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,089
the future if you've really thought

00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,490
about these ideas and you want to

00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:39,010
discuss them more I have a core

00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,680
conversation tomorrow at 5 p.m. called

00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:43,720

being held with Sally young of Lola bot

00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,170
