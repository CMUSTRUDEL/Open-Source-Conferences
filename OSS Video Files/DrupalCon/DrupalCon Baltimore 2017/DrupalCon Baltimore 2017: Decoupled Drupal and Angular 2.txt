Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Decoupled Drupal and Angular 2

Description: 
	With decoupled Drupal gaining more steam by the day and unprecedented approaches entering the mainstream, the need to keep abreast of current front-end technologies has never been more paramount. Angular 2, released last year, is a significant leap forward for the Angular ecosystem with TypeScript usage, a built-in command-line interface, and a focus on "develop once, push everywhere," including web, mobile web, and native. Though the framework has evolved drastically away from Angular 1's versatile yet sometimes unwieldy developer experience, the Angular 2 team has endeavored to ease the transition by providing a graduated transition path from Angular 1 to Angular 2 applications.

Angular has an enthusiastic and large community with ample surrounding tooling. It's an excellent candidate for integration with a decoupled Drupal back end, whether you're using JSON API or Drupal 8's built-in core REST API. Join me as we spelunk into the undiscovered depths of Angular 2 as we dive into the depths of TypeScript (including decorators), observables, Angular 2 components and services, and promise-based communication with Drupal 8.

Here's some of the questions we'll answer together:

Why Angular 2? Why TypeScript?
Why not Angular 1? Why not ES6?
How is Angular 2 architected?
What are the key concepts in Angular 2?
How do I set up, build, and develop an Angular 2 application?
How do I build Angular 2 components and services?
How does routing work in Angular 2?
How do I set up decoupled Drupal 8?
How do I foster communication between Angular 2 and Drupal 8?
What are some of the implications of Drupal-backed Angular 2?
