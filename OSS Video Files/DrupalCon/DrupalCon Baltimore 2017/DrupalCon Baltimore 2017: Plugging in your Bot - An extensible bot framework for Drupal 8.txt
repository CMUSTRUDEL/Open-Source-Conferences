Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Plugging in your Bot - An extensible bot framework for Drupal 8
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Chatbots. We know that’s about all you need to write to get people interested these days, but we trust you’re a more discerning crowd than most, so we’ll expand on the thought a bit more.



While experimenting with bot integrations using Drupal 8, we came across this project on Github, published by the White House. It’s a simple module that provides a tool for building a chatbot on Facebook’s Messenger Platform. It’s simple and engaging; you should check it out.



But once you’ve checked it out you should join our session, where we take the Drupal bot integration tool the White House built and we push it to the next level.



By decoupling the module from Facebook, we enabled it to integrate with other platforms, like Slack, and to build our own custom clients. We also made custom back-ends available, allowing for the bot workflow and steps to come from different sources, including user managed content within Drupal.



How did we do it?



In brief: we forked the Facebook Messenger module and refactored it so that both the client and the back-end leverage the Drupal 8 Plugin API. We extracted the original client to Facebook Client and the original back-end to Default Workflow. Then we added two additional clients: Slack client (for Slack bot integrations) and Web client (for our custom web app), plus we added an additional back end: Managed Content Workflow (which provides a user interface within Drupal for the creation of workflows and steps).



By opening up the original Facebook Messenger module through use of the Plugin API, and by demonstrating additional integrations, we believe we will make experimentation with bots in Drupal more accessible to others in the community.



Come to our session and see how easy it is to be leading the chatbot charge.



What you will learn:

What are some common use-cases for bots
What are the essential components of a bot (client, intents, entities)
How to configure a Drupal 8 site to be the back end for a Facebook Messenger or Slack bot.
How to extend the Bot Framework module to provide additional clients and back-end integrations.

so welcome thank you for joining us what

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,379
are we here to chat about today that's

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,540
my one joke for the presentation

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,469
all right um we're here to chat about

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,969
chatbox

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,670
we're here to chat about chatbox and

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,560
Drupal my name is Everett zu felt I'm

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,660
associate director of technology at my

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
planet I worked with a number of our

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,140
customers and our development and

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,710
implementation teams just to keep

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,930
everything running smoothly I'm Raphael

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,210
Sylvan um

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,110
tenure Drupal developer at night planet

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,390
and I develop answer as well website

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,200
then it's many other systems for the

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,550
company and we want to just give you a

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,040
little bit of an introduction what is

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,510
this presentation about today and what

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,770
it's not about this is not a

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,950
conversation about artificial

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,570
intelligence we actually want to get in

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,539
at the end we want to talk about some of

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,920
the experiments we want to do next and

00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,690
integrating AI with the chatbot work

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,309
that we've done so far definitely is

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,530
what we want to look at but this is not

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,420
a conversation about AI this is a

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,110
conversation about everything you need

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,340
to do with a chatbot before you start to

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,260
look at integrating artificial

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,760
intelligence so what we are talking

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,880
about today we're tax talking both

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,470
chatbots what comprises a chat bot and

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,330
how we can integrate chat BOTS with

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,189
Drupal how we can build your chat BOTS

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,860
based on Drupal my planet really quickly

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,509
about us we're a design and development

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,460
organization we're headquartered in

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,070
Toronto we have offices Toronto

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,479
Vancouver some offices in Europe and

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,509
we've got a small sales office in

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,740
Chicago the I'd say probably about half

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,950
of the work we do at the moment is

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,990
Drupal based design and delivery the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,700
other half the work we do is around a

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,470
couple of different technologies areas

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,030
we do some native work we've done some

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,540
Android wear work that was kind of

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,009
interesting we do JavaScript application

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,200
development so whether it's angular

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,350
react or other types of frameworks on

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,060
the front end and we do some Java work

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,060
as well because everybody loves Java

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,750
agenda for today what are we going to

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,860
talk about we're going to talk about an

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,479
overview of chatbots

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,819
we're going to talk about some use cases

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,630
in the wild where we've seen chat bots

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,850
actually

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,310
in use on live production sites we're

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,990
going to talk about chatbots and Drupal

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,210
there's a couple of modules to just be

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,830
aware of that exist along with the the

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,090
experimental one that we are working on

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,090
at the moment and that we're going to be

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,980
demonstrating we're going to talk about

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,600
our experimental module how it went

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,730
together and how it works we're going to

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,260
show a couple of demos

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,720
fingers crossed with the Wi-Fi one with

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,590
face with message ear one with black and

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,210
then we're going to talk to you about

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,890
where we want to go next with our

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,360
experimentation maybe some

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,450
experimentation that you can do along

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,330
with us because this module is up on

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,130
drupal.org it's project chat bot that

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,080
that namespace was available so we

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,340
grabbed it and then just talking about

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,630
some of the interesting things we'd like

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,850
to do through the rest of the year to

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,160
build up our understanding of how we can

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,190
marry a rich content management system

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,680
like Drupal together with the idea that

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,940
you know really in the last chat BOTS

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,160
have been around forever but really in

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,540
the last sort of a year or so has really

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,100
starting to started to pick up speed

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,470
there's been acquisitions in the

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,710
industry so it's definitely a place that

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,480
that's right for innovation I'll start

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,640
out by giving a little little chat about

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,490
chat bots in kind of an overview and

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,020
then Raphael pick it up from there so I

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,860
think we're all familiar we all have

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,870
smartphones most smartphones today have

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,410
some have a chat pod integrated we've

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,700
got Siri here so I can ask let's see

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,240
that she's gonna get she's not going to

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,640
understand me

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,640
great what's the weather in Baltimore

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:51,670
cloudy conditions will continue

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,770
the fish so slowly chief daddy so

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,910
currently cloudy 15 degrees and it's

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,130
going to rain for the rest of the day

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,260
really unpleasant week here in Baltimore

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,940
this week so you know we're we're

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,950
familiar with this we interact with

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,319
chatbots we might not think about it as

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,170
a chatbot but whether it's alexa google

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,239
home siri or many many other devices we

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,220
all interact with these tools or at

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,860
least most of us do on a daily basis I

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,269
know I use Siri everyday so you know

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,519
we're I think we're all familiar with

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,950
what it is there's a system somewhere

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,460
there's some content analytics some rich

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,570
data there's us sending a request to

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,889
that system I think most of the sizzle I

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,900
think that for a lot of people is in the

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,729
natural language processing you know we

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,650
can ask Siri 20 different ways for the

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,600
weather in Baltimore somehow she's able

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,950
to understand that I'm looking for

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,410
weather and I'm looking for it in

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,060
Baltimore and and as Raphael starts to

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,250
talk about kind of the components of

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,200
what goes into a chatbot he's going to

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,419
explain some things around entities and

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,990
intense so really that's what a chatbot

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,330
is it's really just a way for a human to

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,830
interact with the computer whether or

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,440
not it's doing it through a more of a

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,060
directed choose-your-own-adventure you

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,310
know hey Everett would you like to know

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,810
the weather in drop-down list of cities

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,550
and I select the one I'm interested in

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,940
or if it's using natural language

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,380
processing to infer from my speech what

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,380
it is or my writing what it is I'm

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,120
looking to achieve the experiment really

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,470
that we are looking to do around chatbot

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,770
to the goal that we set out for

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,060
ourselves was you know number one we

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,580
really just wanted to understand

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,140
structurally what is a chat pod what are

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,360
they made of how does the messaging

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,740
back-and-forth work we didn't want to

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,510
reinvent the wheel and there's many

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,850
frameworks out there to look at so step

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,990
one we just wanted to understand

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,960
commonly what are the components that go

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,820
into a chat bot secondly and really

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,890
quite inspired by the facebook messenger

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,650
work that was released by the former

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,660
White House we wanted to take a look at

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,190
how can we build on top that we thought

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,900
it was a really interesting architecture

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,940
that they put together but really

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,490
tightly coupled on in a couple of places

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,140
first of all the chat the facebook

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,870
messenger module really tightly

00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,969
unsurprisingly coupled to Facebook so

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,249
there wasn't an ability

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:05,249
to swap it with that Facebook component

00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:07,199
with other chat clients on the backend

00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:10,079
the Facebook messenger from module

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,079
really tightly coupled into a workflow

00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,719
management that requires a developer to

00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,369
write code so in order to program that

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:19,559
facebook Messenger bot there needs to be

00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:21,659
some coding that gets done so what we

00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:23,009
wanted to do the second part of the

00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,319
experiment first part was just

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:27,269
understand chat BOTS better in the

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,479
second part can we use the plug-in

00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:33,799
system in Drupal along with kind of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,569
starting from the the Facebook module to

00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:39,360
extend and allow for us to have a

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,759
framework where on the front end you can

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,169
build a client framework so the two that

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,539
Raphael is going to demonstrate or

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:48,059
Facebook and slack and on the back end

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,159
to have a plug-in or a pluggable

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,739
approach to how we can actually create

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,659
that workflow and how we can take the

00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:56,909
workflow out of the hand to just being a

00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:59,099
development tool and into the hands of a

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:00,809
content creator or a Celt or I guess in

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,059
the case of a chat bot the person who's

00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:04,619
actually writing the story that the chat

00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,209
bot is telling to the consumer who's

00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,739
interacting with it so that's what we

00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,019
were looking to do now Raphael I think

00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:14,610
you're going to talk a little bit about

00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:17,639
use cases for chatbox yeah so I would

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:23,009
like to talk about some common use cases

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,499
for chatbox um so uh one of the first

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:29,009
things that you can think of when

00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:31,849
talking about chat pauses asking just

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:35,399
like ever did asking for the weather so

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:40,589
you talk to Siri or you can use any

00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:43,860
other kind of approach to talk to a chat

00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:46,829
bot and he will the chat bot will know

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,009
how to treat it and give it back for you

00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:54,929
this information so for example these

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:59,849
high Panchal facebook chat or siri or

00:07:54,929 --> 00:08:04,139
any kind of other chat bot that can go

00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,879
to a to a weather tight and grab

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,779
information gives you back that

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,509
information based on your query the same

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,069
thing goes for survey you can have a

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:19,430
chat bot where

00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:23,460
the chatbox chatbot f you would like to

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,009
answer some survey and you have a uni

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,399
well answered saying yes or no and then

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:32,639
it gives you the questions and you give

00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:36,779
back the answers that this service but

00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:40,229
as example and a to-do list you can

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:44,699
create a to-do list just sending your

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:49,920
to-do items or even asking to mark check

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:53,069
out the the item or anyway remove in an

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,630
item for the chat box as well there's a

00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:59,699
to do buffer dad

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:03,089
news you can retrieve news from websites

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:08,760
CNN has a chat boxes that to that does

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:11,910
just that you can even bind buy stuff

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,019
from the chat bot like the the north's

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:19,949
firm and and you always have the chance

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,470
to just chat with a chat bot that does

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:28,260
nothing it's just chat with you back so

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:31,260
get your very lonely yeah so yeah these

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:36,060
are some use cases for chat box you can

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:40,529
think in a many many many orders use

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:43,949
cases but in the end of the day the chat

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:47,670
bot will automate some process that you

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:50,550
have so you don't have to have a person

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:53,730
on the other side to do this rid

00:09:50,550 --> 00:10:00,050
repetitive tasks or boring tasks you can

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:04,380
automate that and scale your business so

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:07,620
next on chat bots and drupal what do we

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,860
have already about chat bots in the

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,350
Drupal community and as specifically

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,199
specifically for modules what modules do

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,529
we have for chat BOTS well on Drupal

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:26,910
Drupal Arg

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:27,780
you can find three three modules one

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,510
another

00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,810
is the one we built so if you can

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:37,950
already find it there but I didn't list

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:43,470
it here so the first one is a bot module

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,700
it's a IRC chat bot model it if I guess

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,240
it's just for a drupal 7 version but um

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,620
yeah you can call it and use it for your

00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:02,340
for your IRC channel to answer you back

00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:05,430
the second one is a l8i ml parser it's

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:09,840
not really a chat bot first case it's

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:13,890
it's just an integration with a tool but

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,580
it uses a markup language for talking

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:21,450
back to this other chat bot so but yeah

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,940
if you can consider that one and the

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,790
last one is the facebook messenger Bob

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,840
it's a hosted right now it's hosted on

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:35,970
github and it's the one we forked from

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:39,930
we created our own module deriving from

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:43,500
this one and it's a good very very good

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,780
module it's very scripted but as Everett

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,770
said in the beginning it's also tightly

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,680
coupled to only Facebook so we we tried

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:56,360
another different approach so we can use

00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,170
a module that works not only with

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:05,270
Facebook but with slack or York Euston

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:14,420
chat bot or your chest mechanism your

00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:18,930
application so how is this module built

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:24,540
it's an only Drupal 8 so we we didn't

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,750
back port it for Drupal 7 so you will

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,320
have because the main reason of that is

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,550
because we are Levert leveraging on the

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,820
[Music]

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:39,540
plug-in API so it doesn't exist in

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,610
Drupal 7 and of course that it doesn't

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,670
matter it makes it doesn't make

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,820
any sense to beg pardon

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:52,649
as I said it's worship from facebook

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:57,450
messenger bottom you can use the the

00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:00,029
plug-in API to extend it era when we

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,730
deliver that we deliver that with two

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:07,769
integrations right now Facebook and

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:13,010
slacks and as you can of course extend

00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:17,220
it what are the components of a chat bot

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,410
so for this module you probably will

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,839
have seen these names differently in is

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:25,529
depending on the context you're familiar

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:29,550
with but these are the names we choose

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:32,760
to use so we are using a message type

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,769
what kind of things a message type so

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,440
when you interact with the chat bot

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,470
you're just not your probably sending

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,839
them just text most of the time but it

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:47,550
will send you back information in a more

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:53,519
rich format so you might have images you

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:57,029
might have videos links buttons that you

00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:01,250
can interact with and even uh it can

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:05,310
have it can have some decision behind

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:09,060
but you can program under it to say okay

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,690
if that word come up I want to lead

00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:16,380
these this conversation to this way or

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:20,730
if this word come up I I want to go to

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:24,180
the other way so that's another type so

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,699
these are the image message types it's

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,839
extensible so you can create your own

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:34,170
our my chat mechanism has a different

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:37,220
way we don't like images but we like I

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,620
don't know some kind of obscure way to

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,519
send information to the user I want to

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:48,449
send them I don't know a calendar

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:53,670
information IITs whatever you can create

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:56,730
a your message type

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,550
next one is the message of course this

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,829
is the way that these messages are

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,529
delivered to the user so when the user

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:08,850
interacts with the chat bot the chat bot

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:11,279
gets back message from those types and

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,589
then we have tapped there are that can

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,839
be just a simple message that is

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,990
delivered back to the user or I can

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,149
pound the masses a group of message that

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,310
doesn't matter really the type of the

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,019
message but it gathers to get a lot of

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,630
message and send back to the user

00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,980
you're going to see that on the demo if

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,100
it's not making sense now

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,880
I hopefully believe it will make sense

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:39,660
then and least but not last or last but

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:45,120
not least there is a workloads where

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:48,750
flows are the way that you organize visa

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,769
steps so a workflow is like a compound a

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,829
group of steps that makes sense that the

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,019
chat bot will fall and deliver back for

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:03,480
you when you are interacting with with

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:07,199
it so as I said we have message types

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,380
can detect image video buttons this kind

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,110
of I'm calling decisions that are based

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,670
on the text the user sensitive to the

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:22,500
chat bot it will interact back and

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:25,320
here's kind of how a tab will behave you

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,350
have a decision for instance with a lot

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,070
of message that can be just text image

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:35,820
videos anyway and it when you have a

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:39,720
decision type or a button types that are

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:43,110
the two main ways to go to another step

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,800
that's not the following one you can

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,050
interact with that and go to another

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,860
step a different step and so you can

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:56,670
continue on and on until your workflow

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,760
is done and as I said there's a the

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:05,179
workflow come with a lot of

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:10,169
step so we are ready to a quick demo I

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:13,970
want you to download the Drupal user

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:17,809
interface that we created to manage this

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:25,339
chat bot let's see if I can make it go

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:25,339
there oh let me try another approach

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:41,210
that me that didn't work I guess I can

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:46,410
move that back okay so here we have a

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:52,110
Drupal website Drupal way running this

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:57,030
chat bot and uh and as you can see I can

00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:00,660
see but you can see we have the chat bot

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:04,830
let me see if I can just make my screen

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:13,130
go together so I can see what you can

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:13,130
see and I'm kind of lost here

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,620
I can't really see that

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:41,700
okay I guess now it's much better okay

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,159
so we can see the same thing so as you

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,009
can see here I guess it's a little bit

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,789
small but tries to make it a little

00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:55,529
bigger so we have set up this module

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:58,830
with a lot of mechanisms so you can

00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:01,799
interact with so you have the workflow

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,960
list the stab list message list chat

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,720
bubble is because you have more than one

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,619
chat board and you have message time

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,499
your and everything is configured

00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:17,279
configurable so I'm not going to the

00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:19,590
configuration part but I'm show you some

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:23,029
kind of message types that we are have

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:26,340
we already have set up so you can see

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:28,379
there is a button a decision message

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,860
image a text

00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:34,889
each item of that is an entity a drupal

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:40,019
entity so you can add fields remote

00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:43,950
remove field and so on so forth let me

00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:49,249
go back here and go to field manage

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:52,619
field for the buttons for instance so

00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:55,980
this module has a dependence that is

00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:58,830
good collection so you can have many

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,860
buttons as many buttons that you want as

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:06,840
many messages as you want and so on and

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:11,669
so far I would not be able to access

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:17,879
this from here I have to go there but

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:21,179
anyway let me get get the image okay you

00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:24,450
have an image field here just like any

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:27,690
regular entity and Drupal where you can

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:32,580
set up the fields the way you the way

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:35,549
you want and this is these are the

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,640
message type message message type and

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:41,820
then you go to chat box list

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,510
so as I said we developed two plugins

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:48,390
and you can create as many workflows or

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:53,670
as many as chatbots

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:57,930
you want and just as simple as just

00:20:53,670 --> 00:21:01,350
clicking and add button and fill in some

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:04,440
fields the name of the chat wat the

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:07,650
plug-in type this one you of course have

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,890
to develop and the end point the web

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,740
hook end point where the chat mechanism

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:17,280
will interact with your chat log and

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:21,330
some configuration this is a point where

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,590
we are improving that it's not like the

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:28,320
perfect way yet but we are working and

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:31,580
you can assign the workflow I'm gonna

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,400
get the one that is already set up I

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:38,700
guess can be the Facebook one so you

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:43,430
have a bunch of variables those

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:46,950
variables as I said it's leading us to a

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:49,980
improvement we are going to make these

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:53,910
field balls so you don't have to use

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:58,160
these syntax but as for now it's just a

00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:03,270
way there is edit it's set up to a

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:08,480
workflow here and if we go to the

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:11,130
workflow you see we have two workflows

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,600
these two workflows can be set to any

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,370
chat bot or you can create as many

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,200
workflows as you want for as many chat

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:25,110
BOTS you want so for the button workflow

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:30,210
we have a bunch of steps here as you can

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:32,850
see four steps are set depending on the

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,930
way you set these the steps they can

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:40,560
have as many messages within these steps

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:45,660
and when we are going to demo the actual

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:49,440
but you will see how it works and let me

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,299
go back here the message with so these

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,610
are the message with

00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:59,059
for these emails so there are a lot of

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,549
methods here and some of them are just

00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:07,190
pure text some of decisions some art

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:09,289
buttons and some are images okay so what

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,100
does that means for you guys

00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:16,509
it means you want you if you were

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,490
planning to use just these two chat BOTS

00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:21,889
to to chats mechanisms facebook

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,119
Messenger and black you don't have to do

00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,999
anything else

00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,820
to program or to you can implement a

00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:31,700
chat bot using Drupal right now you can

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:36,789
just go ahead grab the module install it

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:39,409
configure and go play with it if you are

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,960
planning to use a different chat

00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:45,499
mechanism you you'll probably extend

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:49,999
this module and I will show you later on

00:23:45,499 --> 00:24:02,090
how to do that so coming back to the

00:23:49,999 --> 00:24:06,950
presentation so what are you going to do

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:09,740
to extend the chat bot module ah you

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,230
have to implement a plug-in API well we

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:18,049
created the plugins API and then you

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,480
just implement over it you you will have

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:25,789
the ability to create your own message

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:29,299
types so you see we have image text

00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:32,929
decision buttons but as I mentioned you

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:36,440
can have a video or a link or an is like

00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:38,960
you have those fancy message you can

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,960
have your own fancy message types

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,330
created so you implement that in your

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,320
module and it's floatable and it will

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,320
work the same way

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:53,720
it will showed up on all the screen you

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,299
just saw and you can continue one you

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,309
can create your service you will have to

00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:00,460
create your service because it's the way

00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,570
you interact with the

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,009
chat mechanism so that's this is the

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,139
biggest part you're going to implement

00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,419
alongside with the workload that's not

00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:14,860
the next thing you're gonna have to

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:19,779
implement those things because every

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:23,440
chat bot has a F chat mechanism has its

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,539
own API and sometimes it's not it's some

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,840
sometimes it's a standard a standard one

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:31,830
sometimes it's not at a and you will

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,490
ended up having to queue some eyes that

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:39,279
we're planning to make it more

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,409
extensible in the sense that the default

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,929
configuration you don't have to rewrite

00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:45,879
but if for this moment you have to

00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:51,190
rewrite some part of what we have for

00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:55,539
you work flows at a hopefully you can

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:59,639
see this this is a simple example of

00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:02,740
what does a chat bot plugging look like

00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:06,700
it's as simple as that

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,340
you'll probably have to implement as I

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,279
said these services and the workflow it

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,200
will consume a lot much more code but as

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:21,190
for the plug-in itself it's basically

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:25,059
these two methods and one class that you

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:34,690
write with the appropriate annotation

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:37,360
right um so let's go to another demo the

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,500
guys that are more into code I will show

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,669
you some code later on

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:50,139
[Music]

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:53,010
okay let's see if my let's see if the

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:58,120
chat bot will work on the presentation

00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:00,730
hopefully we'll so these these chat bot

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,529
I have I'll go back to Drupal just a

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:09,190
second just to show you let me go back

00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:13,299
here first chat bot list so I'm going to

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:16,539
interact with black so what is the

00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:20,500
workflow that I'm using it's this Pizza

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:26,639
workflow that I created if I go back to

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:30,610
the workflow list you see these steps

00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:35,039
this is what we chat bot will interact

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:38,019
with me when I was in black and uh

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,970
hopefully you will see this in action so

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:45,309
let's go back there and I say hi and

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,190
let's see if the chat box alive all

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:52,539
right it worked

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:58,269
so ah on my chat pod workflow I created

00:27:52,539 --> 00:28:01,450
a image type so it came with an image

00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:06,429
this image is being served by Drupal I

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:12,279
can show you that match later but and we

00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:15,880
also have a tree sorry two other text

00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:18,519
message in this very first step so let

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,289
me go back a little bit here the pizza

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:26,200
start staff here is composed by these

00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:30,120
three main items the image and the two

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:36,549
text let me go back there and show you

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:42,250
the pizza start tab so hopefully it will

00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:47,590
make sense for you okay ah you see I

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:50,500
said three it says it says two message

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,010
here you can see two messages let me go

00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:58,640
back

00:28:52,010 --> 00:29:02,029
this oh yeah I know I see there was a

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,520
little flicker on the chat pod

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:08,029
but anyway it's to message not three as

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:12,529
I said before but anyway so it's asking

00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:17,179
me what kind of interaction do I want to

00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:20,090
do and these message here hi welcome to

00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:23,270
Pizza Planet how can I help you this

00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:27,740
message is also a decision message

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:31,429
depending on what I send to the chat box

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:35,210
it will answer me differently

00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:39,770
that's why it sent me this to continue

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:53,000
please inform your option so if I say hi

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:56,179
I would like to see your menu okay and

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,809
so it came back the options on their

00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:02,929
menu these options are also defined in

00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:08,179
Drupal as three simple math three simple

00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:18,289
text message in a single stack so I say

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:21,200
okay I learnt babe very runny at a and

00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:23,179
it answers me back and say okay it's

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,860
twelve and a half

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:30,890
thank you it will take 15 minutes to

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:34,490
prep prepared and so these workflow is

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:39,590
done if I start it over again and I'll

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:43,669
say hi it will out it says it's give me

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:48,320
the operation time because that's one of

00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:52,190
the things that we are yet to complete

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:55,669
on the chat bot module for now you only

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:58,309
you the chat bot module you will go

00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:02,840
through all these steps in the workflow

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:04,170
and these steps specifically the one for

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,770
the operation time

00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:13,620
is another a different step that I could

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:19,710
take on the right on the beginning so

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:27,540
let me start it over and and ask what is

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:29,280
your Oh any time and now you see it's

00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:33,510
the same message because it's the same

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:38,460
step the difference is because the chat

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:41,250
board didn't go to the end of a slot of

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,210
lots and stop it there it's continuous

00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:47,460
on until the last message was sent so

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,700
that's something that we are yet to

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:56,640
improve in this module but anyway so

00:31:50,700 --> 00:32:01,410
this visas tab I'm sorry this flood this

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:06,630
flow is set for chat for slack but what

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:12,179
if I changed I want to change it to use

00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:16,740
a different workflow so I go to my chat

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:21,360
bot list and I added it and instead of

00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:24,510
oh sorry and it's tab of using the

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:32,000
picker workflow I can set it up to use

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:32,000
the button workflow once it's saved

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,590
let me go back here and I say hi again

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:48,050
and this time it's not giving me the

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:50,870
pizza menu a workflow it's Kimmy the the

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:55,490
buttons workflow so it's a different

00:32:50,870 --> 00:33:00,020
workflow working independently I mean

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:02,450
working no matter what a chat mechanism

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,780
you are using it's as I said it's

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:08,870
pluggable so I here you can see a

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,600
different approach it gives us some

00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,800
message and a decision through that if

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,310
not anymore

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,940
through text so I can say oh I'm feeling

00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,230
good

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:23,930
and if it will send back the message to

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:27,710
the chat bot and depending on what

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:31,790
message you choose it will leave you to

00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,080
a different flow to a different tab it's

00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,510
taking a little bit longer

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,440
probably the Wi-Fi or something like

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:43,760
that but anyway you see I you can just

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:50,660
change it through the interface but what

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:54,100
about Facebook Wow let's try to let's

00:33:50,660 --> 00:34:00,790
stripe on Facebook here

00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,790
say hi let's see if we work

00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:08,819
Jesse I'm experiencing some connect oh

00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:11,299
yeah that's it let me do a quick change

00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:17,489
and do it better

00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:20,649
so I can use my own internet connection

00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,649
[Music]

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,460
yeah

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:40,940
all right let's see that that we work

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:45,730
okay you see now that we have connection

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:50,330
it came back with a lot of flattering

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:53,300
but anyway if I choose I feel bad

00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:57,650
it says oh I'm sorry it took a different

00:34:53,300 --> 00:35:01,790
path our facebook chat is set to use the

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:04,070
same flow flow so we have oh hi there

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,770
how are you how are you feeling the same

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:13,370
the same the very same workflow is

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:17,750
working here if I say hi again I and it

00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:21,440
will start spitting some message I can

00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:26,870
choose whatever I want and just to demo

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:30,980
purposes let me show you if I go back to

00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:38,920
the Facebook and change it to use the

00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:38,920
very same Pizza Pizza workflow okay

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:55,060
let's try it again let's see if it work

00:35:49,960 --> 00:36:02,020
Facebook is kind of quirky sometimes it

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:02,020
just say oh you're good but you're not

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,810
okay so Facebook has given her a hard

00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,200
time

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:16,520
never mind we can we can work on that

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,650
later but as you can see I explodable in

00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:23,990
the sense that you can develop your own

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:26,300
chat about a module or plugin and it's

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:29,930
in the sense that we can just flip for

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:34,060
one word flow to a chart model to

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:37,730
another chat bar let me go back here

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,790
okay before I go to the further

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:44,540
improvements I've mentioned some I'm

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:57,430
just want to show you and hopefully it

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:57,430
will enter presenter mode yeah workflow

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,610
okay and that's not a way

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:27,300
yeah if I if I type the right name it

00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:32,520
will work better chatbox Facebook okay

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:37,380
so uh I don't know if you can see to

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:42,150
dark but anyway that's the code for the

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:46,890
plugin so you see there is I'm sorry

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:50,210
there's this annotation uh it extends

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:54,000
for the chat bot plug-in interface I

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:57,120
mean it implements and it's extend for

00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,320
the chat not plug-in and you see some

00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,250
methods that are instantiating here

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:08,520
those methods are a pretty standard

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:10,800
that's why I choose these two to put on

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,190
that slide because they are the ones

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,500
that really does a trick and if you go

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:22,050
to chat facebook

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:25,830
I'm sorry face book service as I said

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:27,990
here is where the magic happens you have

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:35,000
the type of message you can interact

00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:39,170
with and that the way it will answer

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:44,160
when the chance mechanism talks to your

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,860
chat bot if we know how to give it back

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,850
the information in the sense that it can

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:53,100
talk to the chat mechanism API so

00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:56,550
basically it's the implementation of the

00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:59,640
their API but only the part that makes

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:05,040
sense for your chest to chest with the

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,260
the chat button your the chat service so

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,730
you can send message then so on and so

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:15,120
far as I said this module is available

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:17,780
on Drupal org so if you can go now

00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,780
Drupal

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,349
you see you can get the code and feed

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:27,670
better than the big screen here but

00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:31,770
anyway it's there and you can see so

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:36,089
let's go back now to the presentation

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:38,380
okay so what are these future

00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:43,290
improvements that we want to make on

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:45,820
these this module and the future

00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:49,810
improvements we want to see for a

00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:52,839
chatbot as a whole of course there's

00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:55,720
room for refactoring on this code as I

00:39:52,839 --> 00:40:00,490
said this code was forked from the

00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Facebook module White House view but

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:06,280
yeah some things are we proved some

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,339
things are the same and something

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,849
changes along the way and so we have to

00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:16,440
adapt it and we have to do this

00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:20,680
refactoring you can of course create

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,890
fancy and many other message sites

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:27,700
so these message types are going to be

00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:31,510
used throughout the other model

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:35,349
throughout the other app plugins so you

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:40,450
can think of that as a way to make it

00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:44,170
better for the user interact and get a

00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:47,130
rich experience and of course there is

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:50,680
the intricate integration with the AI

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:54,730
mechanisms as I said in the beginning

00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,420
this presentations not about AI but it's

00:40:54,730 --> 00:41:02,589
inevitable that you probably inevitable

00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:06,180
that you you want some kind of AI behind

00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:09,430
it and you will try to implement it so

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:13,720
this is one of these next steps we are

00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:17,230
looking for to implement is a some kind

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:21,400
of way to interact with these AI ap is

00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:25,000
so you can figure the task reviews tend

00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:30,069
to you back to the

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,680
ái api so we can evaluate and come back

00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:35,349
to a more relevant just not just a

00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,339
simple workflow but a more relevant just

00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:43,540
like Siri or any kind of way I'll think

00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:47,220
of that like Amazon lakhs or IBM Watson

00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:51,190
and and it can give you a better answer

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:56,470
so these are the improvements we are

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:58,119
looking for and there's a couple other

00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,760
sorry there's a couple of other things

00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,650
that we would want to do one of them is

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,170
some of these some of the things we have

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:08,470
listed here's AI platforms they really

00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:10,960
are chat bot platforms so API AI I think

00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,390
is a good example of that but we want to

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,089
take a look at so we have the idea of a

00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:18,490
chat bot we have Drupal which I think if

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,400
we're here we all know is a rich content

00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,230
management framework and I think some of

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,480
us experimentation we want to do is we

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,780
look into the future is doesn't make

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,089
sense to necessarily be having maybe the

00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,869
intent or the behaviors assessed by the

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:37,210
AI platform brought into Drupal married

00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:39,430
with content and then shared back out to

00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,109
the chat service and maybe it's worth

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,020
doing an experiment to see if it makes

00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:46,030
sense to plug Drupal in as a system

00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,490
integration into some of these chat

00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:51,069
services so that the message could go

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,710
from say slack to API bi

00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,480
it could go to Drupal then and pick up

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,549
some content and share it back so

00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,130
exactly what order these these three

00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:01,690
integrated systems integrated in think

00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,790
we want to experiment with that as well

00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,589
we know that Drupal it has the rich

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,450
content about a lot of the brands that

00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:09,609
we work with we just want to know where

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:12,190
to plug that into the experience around

00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:14,920
you know message evaluation and

00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,410
connecting with the the chat service API

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,869
s and then another thing that we want to

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,349
take a look at is you know if we have

00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:24,369
customers if we have consumers and users

00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,859
interacting and they're essentially

00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:28,960
exhibiting behaviors with the chat bot

00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:30,880
how can we take some of those behaviors

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,160
and push it into a platform like aqua a

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,250
lift to be able to better understand who

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,400
that anonymous consumer is maybe taking

00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,910
that a step further

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,500
how can we pull some of the segmentation

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:44,870
knowledge about the user out of a

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,240
platform like aqua a lift and pull it

00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,040
into the chat workflow experience so I

00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,680
can know if you're a returning customer

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,840
have you purchased before are you in the

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,880
evaluation part of the workflow of your

00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,620
of your decision-making workflow if I

00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,790
can understand better who you are from

00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,980
some of that behavioral segmentation

00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,010
data that we would get out of a tool

00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:06,710
like lift we can then perhaps curate the

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,120
chat experience or give you a variation

00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,430
on the workflow that's going to speak

00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,680
specifically to where you are in your

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,540
user journey and your user journey or in

00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,920
your customer journey so those are some

00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,390
other some other things that we want to

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,400
experiment with over the course of the

00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:21,050
year to better understand how we can

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,070
take all of these different tools from

00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,480
behavior analysis segmentation you know

00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:29,410
artificial intelligence natural language

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,520
processing along with the content rich

00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,250
repository that we have in Drupal to

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,880
pull it together into a unified user or

00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,930
customer experience Raphael before we do

00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,270
questions did you have something else

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:44,690
you wanted to add no I guess that's

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:47,810
pretty much it the Drupal con

00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:51,980
organization just asked us to mention

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:57,530
about the the spring scope the code

00:44:51,980 --> 00:45:01,280
Sprint's that we'll run and also yeah to

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:05,270
the take the survey about the Drupal con

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,960
at a right behind right below you can

00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:11,210
see the the link the Google link is a

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,450
link for this presentation in case you

00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,690
wanted the turn is lighter back I would

00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:21,980
publish it a little bit later after the

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:25,840
presentation okay that's it

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,840
we are open to questions if you have any

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:39,950
I shall review the microphone please

00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:43,009
I thank you for presentation I have a

00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:46,430
question regarding the chat bot module

00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:50,869
is there any way to implement some kind

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:53,089
of decision tree I'm sorry I'll like if

00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:54,980
you turn from that decision tree like if

00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:57,140
you have two buttons like a and B and

00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,019
then user clicks a and then there is

00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:03,799
another two buttons D and E and then if

00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:09,099
you click D then down yeah you can

00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:13,400
pretty much it do it as long as the the

00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:16,759
the way we created the the steps you can

00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,279
map any decision to a next step that can

00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:24,799
be another decision and so you can go

00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:27,440
dip and dip and dip into these buttons

00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:30,769
mechanism if I understand your question

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,279
yeah yeah you can do that right now

00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:38,029
oh cool and another question is is there

00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:40,730
any capability of submission of web

00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:45,259
forms or that form integration like to

00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:47,749
save what user enters I don't think so

00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:50,509
no I think that's it's good suggestion

00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:52,039
though for an improvement would be with

00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:55,099
whether some sort of a logging mechanism

00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,779
or some sort of a the ability to then be

00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:59,180
able to look through some logs and see

00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:00,859
the not just the customer input but see

00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,259
what the story was all the way through

00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:05,089
like I think about a chat chat system

00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:06,650
for maybe contact centers where you can

00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:08,299
go back and look through the log and see

00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,249
what each party said so I think that

00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:13,759
could be an interesting opportunity to

00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:16,789
improvement yeah right now you can see a

00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:19,880
history of what the users tend to to the

00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:22,730
chat bot we have a clogging in a noble

00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:26,450
jacket in a table so it goes on and on

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:29,779
and if once it's done it says it it's

00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:34,480
had a flag saying it's done but yeah we

00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:38,089
don't see right now we don't have the

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,130
chat bot part because it can change so

00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:43,190
it would be a good suggestion to have

00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,109
also what the chat box

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,869
head to the user because right now we

00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:51,890
just have what the user said to the chat

00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:54,020
pod got it thank you no problem just uh

00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,069
just a quick question do you have any

00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:01,520
documentation for it or is this like

00:47:57,069 --> 00:48:03,710
creation yes yeah it's pretty much it no

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,589
yeah we are planning to release like

00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,000
documentation at least for the the basic

00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:12,410
stuff

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,950
the code is almost almost entirely

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:19,520
commented with at least is the most

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:22,400
important part but yeah if we definitely

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,329
plan to to soon release some

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,089
documentation how to setup it and it's

00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:31,640
not far it's not that hard right now but

00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:34,010
we definitely are planning to do that we

00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,319
could also I mean it the best way is if

00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,359
there's specific questions create an

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,579
issue in the issue queue for the module

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,990
and take it with documentation and we

00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,760
can answer those specific way and

00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,800
honestly those specific questions we can

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,810
take those answers compile it into a

00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,880
page on on drupal.org so that the

00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:55,040
answers are there for everyone yeah but

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,430
that's really awesome thank you guys and

00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,160
have quick to questions so in regarding

00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:04,130
missing types what do you think about

00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,589
like sending back objects like for

00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:11,900
example like say audio player player

00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:13,970
objects and also web views like

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,460
returning back like a simplified way

00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:19,819
view of your website so what do you

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:22,190
think about that message time yeah the

00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:24,200
the returning message the message type

00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:27,079
that you are planning to implement it's

00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,930
depend on the the chat mechanism you're

00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:32,660
interacting with if your mechanism your

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:35,349
chat mechanism like slack or Facebook if

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:39,400
they support a specific type of

00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:43,040
returning message we can add sense if

00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,990
right now you can create your simple

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,260
message type and send it back

00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:53,270
it's depend only on the way the chat

00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:55,190
mechanisms are expected back so right

00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:00,710
now most mechanisms

00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:03,400
have something for a video for image for

00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:06,710
text for buttons but many of them

00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,430
doesn't have for audio or anything like

00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:12,880
that but since they had that uh we it's

00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:16,070
as simple as just writing a small

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,200
message type I think basically physic is

00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:22,190
going to implement like eppley music in

00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,020
two or one week oh so so though yeah as

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:27,560
soon as they get that we can implement

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:40,060
that as deserve that thank you okay

00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:40,060
thank you I'm sorry I couldn't hear you

00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:45,440
thank you well you're talking about chat

00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,700
boxes

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:53,240
dead box a arm on the back end when we

00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:57,470
are having a conversation mistakes can

00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,600
happen is that any mechanism that your

00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,280
chat box on the back and you supported

00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,100
by a cognitive system that can

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,740
automatically do other Corrections not

00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:10,280
yet not yet not yet okay but I thought

00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:13,040
you were talking with Watson yeah is

00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,500
that part of the mechanism that Watson

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,520
will do the cognitive Corrections

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,290
correct that's the reason why we want to

00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,910
look into some of these AI platforms

00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,850
that are specifically designed around

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:25,310
analyzing conversation sentiment and

00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,200
being able to pull meaning out of what's

00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,540
being sent through by the user so that

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,250
we can have a more reliable way of

00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:34,370
understanding what the customers asking

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,950
for and and how to respond one more

00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:41,150
question if you have the time the three

00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:47,030
modules that you explained I think they

00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:48,920
were AI something BOTS and Facebook

00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:52,880
correct what's the difference between

00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:55,850
the three why would I need free at any

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,280
precision minuses or any situations

00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,260
where you would say gee under these

00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,540
circumstances you would use Facebook

00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:07,550
under these circumstances you would use

00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,650
but I don't see if I

00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,620
really understands your question I can

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,740
try to counter so the bot module as far

00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:18,920
as we know really Keely tied into an IRC

00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:21,350
workflow the facebook messenger module

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,790
once again the two things that we

00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,860
because we started with the Facebook

00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,020
message module the two limitations that

00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,760
we saw there one tightly coupled to

00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,130
Facebook so great if you want a facebook

00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,630
messenger bot really doesn't help you at

00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,970
all if you want to use any other chat

00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,010
service the second limitation that we

00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,530
saw was you have to code out the

00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:41,300
workflow in code there's no UI that

00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:44,540
allows you to create the steps and start

00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:48,290
to tell the story and then the AI ml

00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:51,230
Raphael was that one yeah the AI ml is

00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:53,750
just a specific tool to work with this

00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,120
specific is a specific module to working

00:52:53,750 --> 00:53:00,680
with a specific tool I guess it's called

00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:04,370
Alice it's a node chat bot and it

00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,430
it's just hand back XML files to the

00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:10,670
server to this CAD bot so yeah it's very

00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:14,000
specific and and nothing related to to

00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,220
the chat box we are proposing to build

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,900
here and all these API is the

00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:27,170
energetical I'm sorry api's are the

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:33,110
restful api is the EAP is for oh no no

00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:34,580
they're not restful okay thank you we

00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:37,150
have one or two minutes left - any other

00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,150
final questions

00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:44,270
great all right well thank you all once

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:47,180
again please oh thank you please do fill

00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:49,580
in the feedback survey I know I I'll be

00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,380
honest I seldom do but I really do

00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,700
please fill in the feedback survey

00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,560
because we would like to hear what you

00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,110
have to say and how we can improve upon

00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,170
this for the future yeah thank you thank

00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,170
