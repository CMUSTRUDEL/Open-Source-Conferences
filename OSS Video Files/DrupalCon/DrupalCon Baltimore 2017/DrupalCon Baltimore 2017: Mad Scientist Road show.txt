Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Mad Scientist Road show
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	As lead developer on ELMS: Learning Network, I've often been told I'm a bit of a mad scientist. We do things bold, bright, and always a bit crazy in ELMS land and so I wanted to package several deeper developer concepts from the platform in a way that's reusable by others. This talk will use elmsln as more of a implementation space for highlighting the following "science" experiments created to make the project possible. As a result, this will be a type of lightning talk within a talk in which many concepts are broken into digestable mini-talks. This should help increase engagement instead of being a bogged down fall asleep technical talk.

Simulating accessibility in real time with field loss, dyslexia, colorblindness simulators and more (via a11y module)
How to talk to your Drupal site in the browser (via SpeechRecognition API / annyang ) and have it talk back (via SpeechSynthesisUtterance) with working examples
xAPI - Experience API; What it is, what it affords you, and why companies like Amazon are gaining interest in a learning standard
How we use the Git PHP library, 3rd party open book creation tool Gitbook and github to produce drupal nodes from markdown files; distributing content production and enabling a world of open, reusable Open Educational Resources (OER) in the process (via OERSchema)
Lessons learned from building an Angular 2 app for improved user experiences (and why we'll use webcomponents now instead)
What Webcomponents / Polymer is, how it will revolutionize building applications for the web, What HAX is (and how far along we are with it) and how we envision using them both to eliminate templating in Drupal (over time) and save Drupal authoring experience from "Website tonight" software. #NoTPL
Part inspiration, part showcase, part crazy, this talk will be able to hit many different audiences from the most technical to the newest drupal attendee and those completely off our island. It will be of interest to education and non-education attendees alike because even though our use-cases come from education, things like SpeechRecognitionAPI, Headless development, Polymer / Webcomponents and Markdown importing workflows are use-case agnostic.

The talk will be given by the @elmsln core development team: @btopro (Bryan Ollendyke) and @hey__mp (Michael Potter).

today's talk is called mad-scientist

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,080
roadshow and we'll explain why in a bit

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,450
but my name is Brian Noland I come bt o

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,099
pro on twitter drupal.org and everywhere

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:26,760
else and i've been a community for like

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:30,150
12 years now so we get into a weird

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,840
stuff and why right I'm so why this talk

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,880
so if you go to a LM SL n org you can

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,390
find out more about the work that we we

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,420
do so we don't envision Drupal as like

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,489
this thing that you use to build a you

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,500
know a marketing website if you will we

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,300
view it more as this organic platform

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,530
that we're able to build out lots of

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,050
different sites and lots of different

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,660
configurations to better meet the needs

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,170
of education and educators so whenever

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,149
someone has a crazy idea then up comes

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,340
part of the snowflake right and Drupal

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,229
we think is really great at fragmenting

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,530
from its base but still being

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,900
maintainable via things like features

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,420
drush and so as a result of that we

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,070
don't really build Drupal web sites in

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,570
the traditional sense we moreso use

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,580
Drupal is almost an application

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,430
development framework to build a

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,500
distributed Learning Network and so what

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,960
is Elms in a one slide elevator pitch

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,970
anytime we get a new idea or a faculty

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,979
member has a cool idea we stuff that at

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,570
a new domain it's not really that

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,890
different from Google if you think about

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,110
the way that they do application

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,689
rollouts right YouTube is a video

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,159
service goes in its own domain right but

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,640
I can still log in with my Google

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,610
account

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Doc's Google+ all of these right so if

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,420
we just kept deploying these new ideas

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,820
and new functionality using a federated

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,850
login system we can keep expanding and

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,490
innovating and so in education speak

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,369
this is referred to as ng dle or

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,170
next-generation distributed learning

00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:01,079
ecosystem because we like acronyms for

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,390
no reason but it's so that you end up

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,040
forming you know kind of patterns like

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,479
this right where all these different

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,729
pieces of functionality are stitched

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,310
together via Web Services and single

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,819
sign-on systems so for the end user it

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,280
doesn't feel that way

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,079
so our courses because primarily we do

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,030
this for education purposes would be

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,219
something like this right hey I'm

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,170
learning about math but it's at a

00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,879
courses address and we have kind of a

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,560
course path there that would be a Drupal

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,629
site which we would then network

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,969
together via restful web services with

00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,609
this other Drupal site right but a

00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:35,409
common look and feel common usability

00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,879
patterns common login you don't know

00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:40,239
that you're skipping around if we get

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,950
the UX patterns right way studio has

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,930
another example of place where students

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,769
and interact with each other post images

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,900
the headless angular app and so this is

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,510
all only possible because of the

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,680
architecture and because of Drupal and

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,840
the fact that we basically have a self

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,549
federated ecosystem so all of our Drupal

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,459
sites have knowledge of where all of our

00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,709
other Drupal sites are and faculty

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,709
requesting new course spaces are kind of

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,769
organically building this out right so

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,199
why you care because we get into really

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,430
weird stuff as a result of all of those

00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,799
slides I just burned through really

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,299
quickly there and so what we're going to

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,639
talk about today some of that weird

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,079
stuff that is emerged because of those

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,030
requirements because of just the

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,780
architecture of Elms and the way at

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,069
which we go about design so the first

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,329
one of these little lightning talks in

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:33,009
here is called accessible empathy and so

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,959
the desired outcomes of this experiment

00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,989
fuel is to increase accessibility

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,150
options through user preference and so

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,359
if you end users can select their own

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,310
accessibility options that we not only

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,189
improve outcomes but we also can help

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,650
improve empathy so if we not only allow

00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:53,650
people to check oh hey change a contrast

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,030
ratio but we allow them to check hey let

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,729
me see what this site would look like if

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,319
you had dyslexia we can start to produce

00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,620
empathy with people that have different

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,729
conditions as a result so in looking

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,799
through this and is through a lot of

00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,599
these we had to get off the island right

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,060
there isn't a Drupal module that does

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,799
that and so one of the things it's on

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,829
and getting off the island through these

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,549
needs was open dyslexic open dyslexic is

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,209
an open source font created that

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,400
manipulates all the fonts on your

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,000
website to be more easily readable by

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,419
people with dyslexia so guess what now

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,409
there's a module for that

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,999
so there's the a 11y module if you get

00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:34,310
it it gives you a lot of access these

00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:37,490
plugins they're going to show here in a

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,249
second so I have this little can video

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,590
let's talk through what's going on but

00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:44,689
the way we implement the a11y module is

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,889
you get this panel over here so you can

00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,499
make your interface bigger or smaller

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:50,960
you can do a high contrast mode which

00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:53,990
uses CSS and JavaScript to tweak the

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,819
contrast you can invert the colors right

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,069
which is better for people with certain

00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,219
ocular conditions disable interface

00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:03,949
animations which can help people up not

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:06,500
get disoriented there's the the open

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,270
dyslexic font applied which then is just

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,819
check the box and it rewrites all the

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,430
fonts the loads out then we get into

00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:16,340
simulations so this is able to simulate

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,370
every form of colorblindness

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,560
through SVG filtering and so it's SVG

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,870
filtering the entire interface we can

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,379
simulate field lofts which is something

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:30,379
in the w3c spec to account for and then

00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:33,860
of our refreshed page and I don't click

00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:35,419
the keyboard trick has fun simulating

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,259
dyslexia now I've been told that this is

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:41,539
not what dyslexia is like get it but

00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,520
this was a JavaScript simulator that

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,860
just said it was like hey my friend told

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,990
me that he had dyslexia and and all of a

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,969
sudden the words start doing that so

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,099
trying to create these ways in which we

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,740
can get users to not only say like yes

00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:56,659
ok I have to put alt tags but actually

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,729
empathize with the conditions of people

00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:02,930
that really need these things so it

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:04,819
isn't just alt tag info so if you want

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,589
to learn more about this you can find

00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,729
out a 11y project there's gonna be a lot

00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,779
of links throughout this entire thing

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,960
because these slides will be posted

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:14,120
later so you need to seriously scribble

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,580
a 11y module

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,919
Elmas only org has blog posts as well as

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,310
drupal psu.edu has a lot of blog posts

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,599
that we do through Penn State next one

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,569
of these little talks is called track

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,250
all the things and so our desired

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,740
outcome with track all the things

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,939
because people we want to know what

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,610
students are doing with our course

00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,259
material right kind of like Google

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,060
Analytics type of stuff are you getting

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,300
to these different goals but for us it

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,620
could be

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,139
are your students bothering to watch

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,090
video I don't know you spent a month

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,919
producing a really high quality lecture

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,660
we created little people actually bother

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,699
to look at it

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,410
so again didn't want to use a Drupal

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,970
based solution for this yes there's

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,639
stuff that can do tracking you can just

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,889
write PHP and JavaScript and do it

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,220
but we found a platform called learning

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,669
Locker which is a open source PHP it's

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,039
called a learning record store or LRS

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:12,120
and it uses a standard called experience

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,280
API an experience API to unpack what

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,139
that is basically the events are

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,819
happening all the time everywhere and so

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,860
if you view the world is just emitting

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,990
data at all times like me moving my

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,940
fingers is emitting data that how would

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,280
you track that activity statement and so

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,159
that you can track any activity boil it

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,259
back to a verb a person where it

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:32,699
happened and what they did kind of you

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,099
know maybe some contextualized

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,080
information right and so in this case

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,789
the verb is that I viewed something I

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,729
could mix in some extra context info and

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:47,130
a B hatman did this type of a thing it's

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,810
a glorified JSON array totally changing

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,570
the training and education space but

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,039
it's a glorified JSON array so of course

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,190
there's a Drupal module for glorified

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,240
JSON array called the tin can API which

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,789
is an alternate name for experience API

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,590
it's like you know a talk of its own you

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,930
can actually go to experience API comm

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,669
and then it'll say like I say tin can

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,340
even click tin can and it just rewrites

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,370
all the words to say tin can instead and

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,289
goes to a different domain but when

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,389
implementing the tin can API what we can

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:20,550
do through Drupal is jump in at the

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,770
point at which a message is about to be

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,590
sent to our LRS and we can mix in our

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,190
contact data so in this case we're

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,199
mixing in the course of student in the

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,039
sort of and you know what their role is

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,990
to fact they're students obviously X API

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,510
doesn't really have this connotation of

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,490
what a course in Elms is and so we can

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,770
use the Drupal hook system in this case

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,860
mix that data in sprinkle it along and

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,110
then it goes out the door so to see what

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,730
this ends up producing when you wire the

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,800
world up for X API

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,850
is we've actually got this public elm

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,560
site about X API and so click around the

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,089
things we do this talk at some education

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,529
events we don't actually tell people

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,420
it's like hey you're learning about X

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,940
API but what's happening here is

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,300
everything I'm doing is generating X API

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,649
statements and so then we unlock the

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,170
visualisation of that aspect later for

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,089
people to see like oh that's what it

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,190
means when I'm tracking everything going

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:19,380
on and so even down to the granular

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,449
level of clicking these things and

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,970
dropping them in that order is tracked

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:26,790
and so then it's sent back to this is a

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,110
learning Locker and so then learning

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,579
logger you can unpack and here's the

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,079
statements right so the fact that I

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,240
clicked on that YouTube video and

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,649
monitored and sent a the user played

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,810
from this point in the video to this

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,639
point this doesn't have to do with

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,430
education you can use a lot of people

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:46,110
use tin can and X API for like analytics

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,670
for user tracking in any system if you

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,760
want to learn more about it there's

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,850
experience API comm or tin can API comm

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,250
depending on which word you like to use

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,569
the tin can API module is out there and

00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,639
then there's actually a little open

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:04,529
course about X API if you want to learn

00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:08,579
more about it so next talk here is I say

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:12,180
flat file you say CMS flat file oh I get

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:14,600
flat file yay audience engagement

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,630
participation scores through the roof so

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,310
track it yeah exactly API for that so

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,230
what's the desired outcome of this we

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,220
have faculty members who don't want to

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,569
work with us one of them who was

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,980
supposed to be on this thing he was

00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:28,730
going to give this clock so I can make

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,510
fun of him but so they want to not use

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:36,839
Drupal I can't imagine why it's such a

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,180
great user experience right but part of

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,399
it is just ownership of the material the

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,680
institution owns the deployment of the

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,230
technology and so if he's funneling all

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,260
of his knowledge into that it's in our

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,790
database systems and not something that

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,380
five years from now he's going to be a

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,959
call you know where's that course file

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,220
on my desktop it doesn't exist he

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,240
shoveled all of his efforts into this

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,270
third party thing so the solution that

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,800
he he came to and then we worked on

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,960
pathway to integrating is a tool called

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,080
get book get book is this pretty sweet

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,450
little service that if you write books

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,320
out in the open they get published

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,150
openly and so it's all in markdown it's

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,980
basically zero which is flat file then

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,690
right you just got lots of like hashtags

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,510
and things and then you can publish it

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,040
out the github well then we went okay

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,840
well how do we get it from github into

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,010
Drupal now because I want to take all of

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,320
this flat file

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,910
static material and then put it into a

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,170
dynamic system because that dynamic

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,050
system is how we deliver it to our

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,360
students so in the process of getting

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,030
off the island I found this library

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,590
called just get dot PHP which seemed way

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,910
too good to be true I don't understand

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,850
how it works to be provably on it

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,740
because it doesn't involve Exe C or any

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,750
security implications that typically

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,810
would come with running a command line

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,640
task in this way but it lets you have

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,190
things like this where you say hey

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,410
required get that PHP and then you can

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,020
just say like repo ads and that's going

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,300
to add everything that's on in version

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,830
control on the system right so let's see

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,960
it gives you an interface between PHP

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,710
and get to easily run commands and get

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,410
but from PHP so now there's modules for

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,660
this there's get PHP module which is

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,040
encapsulate the library right so you

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,830
could use it for whatever and then we

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,660
wrote the get book module and get book

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,510
is different from the actual kit book

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,310
website what the get book module does is

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,000
it gives you the ability to invoke

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,620
parser which would be like a you know in

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,540
this case I'm parsing something called

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,460
get book but so that that way you could

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,180
target a different data structure to

00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,150
import so for example is anyone familiar

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,070
with read the docs is to read the docs

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,810
as a documentation thing you do your

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,690
documentation and markdown and then it

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,550
publishes up this nice little mini site

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,830
there's a parser for it in the gift book

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,930
module so you could point a drupal site

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,320
at to that and ingest the whole thing

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,310
and turn it into nodes in a drupal book

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,520
which at that point and do whatever you

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:08,300
want with it so showing this workflow

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,070
looks laid out you know someone not

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,170
using Drupal at all way this is a gift

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,610
look interface and so this is what you

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,730
end up getting right you've got this

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:19,209
content outline these are all markdown

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,940
files very simple navigation and then we

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,649
want to go from that to github so links

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,570
it up there so now you can see the flat

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:30,160
file that were generated and all these

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,769
MD files all right so the folders help

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,290
with the nesting to imply like okay well

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,269
this is down hierarchically under here

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,339
then on the Drupal side with a module

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,699
you get a Content site called get book

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,529
and so plug in just point at the repo it

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:46,690
ingests the repo on to the server and

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,760
then part uses a parser to run through

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,320
and convert all of those into nodes you

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,870
know you can pick the branch or tag

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,510
views and there's also some it's early

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,519
work on two-way thinking so that you

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,639
could theoretically edit in Drupal push

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,100
back to a flat file system and so now

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,930
this outline has entirely been built

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,570
based on the work that's going on on

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,449
github and then we've even got a little

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,120
markdown editor provided by an editor

00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,310
called epic editor and so then you could

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,040
just keep writing and markdown in Drupal

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,500
save how to rip back to the file system

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,660
and then sync it back over to the other

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,569
side this is just showing it yeah hey

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,279
that's on the private files directory

00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:32,139
this is the git repo that we pulled in

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,639
in that case so it's pretty cool works I

00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,319
really like the workflows that that

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,329
actually opens up we've been talking

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,430
about taking content that we have in

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:41,920
Drupal and doing this to all of our

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,139
courses so that we would funnel them out

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,889
into flat file even just as a backup

00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,680
mechanism

00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:49,690
quite honestly or version control beyond

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,790
having to go through and do discs right

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,600
music if module to visualize everything

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,600
which is great but still database driven

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,670
so these are a bunch of links to that

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:06,610
you know every incarnation of git - and

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:09,130
get period and get ok so last one of

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:13,660
mine is Jarvis make me a copy does

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,490
anyone see me do this for ok good would

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,769
ruin it otherwise okay so the desired

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,449
outcome is have a conversation using

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,510
native browser technology is everyone

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,760
seen grief talk to Alexa or okay I don't

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:30,340
want people to have to own an Alexa to

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:35,080
talk to something okay that's the idea

00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:39,370
so let's make Drupal into jardins so

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,690
like that right and so how would we go

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,550
about doing this well we need two

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,290
different modes of communication I need

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,820
to talk to the browser and understand me

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,330
and the browser needs to talk back to me

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,310
and so again I use calm to the rescue

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,490
there's the speech recognition API

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:58,240
there's actually in development for the

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:01,150
browser as a way of brokering okay you

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,760
can accept media input as someone

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,100
talking and recorded text and then

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,740
funnel it to whatever service you want

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,200
so obviously google has one of these and

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,180
then return confidence scores and things

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,850
like that right so you could build these

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,540
types of Siri esque interfaces in the

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,300
browser and so this side of the spec is

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,200
really obviously low priority for a lot

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,340
of people this demo only works in Chrome

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,440
unfortunately on that side with a speech

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,900
recognition and opera cause are pretty

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,630
much the same at this point Firefox you

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,520
can enable flag do it but speech

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,530
synthesis is actually really easy now

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,870
and so there's a lot higher browser

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,570
coverage for that for having the website

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,280
talk because if you think just native

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,990
operating systems already have a lot of

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,700
that voiceover support built into them

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,230
it's really not a logical weak to then

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,790
wire it into core browser tech so again

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,130
getting off the island to the rescue

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,680
there's a library called an Yang and

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,230
yang is this neat little wrapper on top

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,660
of speech synthesis API that lets you

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,630
just basically invoke like thing dot

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,550
speak and then type a word kind of a

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,360
thing that you're listening for and then

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:17,140
if it matches that word then it fires a

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,959
JavaScript Handler and so there's a

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,459
module for that obviously they're

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,860
actually already was a module for this

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,660
before I started exploring this and it's

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:29,230
called voice commander so that I just

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,090
made a 2x version of it that takes it a

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,040
little further than did before but the

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,120
way that you can integrate with voice

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,280
based commands then is so this uses

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,350
command and so yeah I have kind of this

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,360
array of the phrase that we're going to

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,130
listen for and phrase could be a almost

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,830
a trigger word kind of like Alexa or

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,530
Siri or hey Google write that trigger to

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,210
invoke listening or paying attention so

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,000
you can you can include one of those and

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,190
then anything in the brackets is or

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,890
parentheses rather is like optional

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,220
right so if I said like hey ohm play

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,610
would be the equivalent of a elms play

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,970
video in that case and you can do other

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:11,190
tokenized input like that then it's just

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,110
tapping a JavaScript function on the

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,360
other side and so that you'd be you're

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,800
below always committed okay and then

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,320
whatever I want it to say so that's the

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,830
talk back to me the other side is we

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,160
hate whenever you match this word I need

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:32,390
you to invoke this so wiring this up to

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:41,960
a whole interface then scroll next page

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:41,960
next page previous page back forward a

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:52,590
elms anything I can do for you admin

00:18:45,470 --> 00:19:01,610
open preferences alternate formats open

00:18:52,590 --> 00:19:08,640
speed reader speed reader play close

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:10,380
next page scroll read to me since this

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,490
week will likely involve a fair amount

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:20,700
of waiting for people to elves what is

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,490
lecture from Wikipedia called a new

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,220
lecture from the French lecture meaning

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,200
reading process is a more presentation

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,510
intended to present information or teach

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,490
people on a particular subject for

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:37,530
example by a university or college talk

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,000
right so that last part this is there's

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,160
a blog post for us as making

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,320
okay Google that last part is then

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,540
tapping into another project called

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,880
puzzler which taps into the Wikipedia

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,780
Web API so then I have a trigger word

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,340
for hey you know define what is right

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,520
what is is the key phrase it's listening

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,410
for I also did because the question

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,180
would come up anyway there is a way of

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,060
putting this into continuous listening

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,300
mode which is how not invoke light so

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,740
you're just talking right it's also

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,360
affectionately known as letting the NSA

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,740
listen in on literally everything you do

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,370
on a webpage so yes but then yeah we're

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,440
aware of that

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,990
so normally you hit two keys to invoke

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,640
that to happen right as opposed to just

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,050
letting it run all the time but I do

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,350
usually just let it run all the time

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:28,180
because I'm really lazy but that last

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,100
part is tapping puzzler and puzzlers

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,530
hitting the Wikipedia API finding that

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,840
word as the query returning if there's

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:39,190
any result and then using speech to then

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:42,130
say the thing at the end but the problem

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,380
is that the name of this was make me a

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,620
coffee

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,200
make coffee why don't you get me a

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,810
coffee I do all the hard work anyway

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,030
I'll have a venti americano with six

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:58,530
shots of expresso it was a rough night

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,570
last night processing all those rosters

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,680
so you can do obviously lots of Easter

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,270
eggs and now I'm not going to put one in

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,910
for Konami code because you know saying

00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,650
up up down down left right that'd be a

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,260
little extreme but if you want to learn

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,840
more about those technologies that's the

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,700
voice commander module and an yang and

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,980
then there's the turn your site into

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,330
Google home which is wiring a whole

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,090
bunch of different things together it's

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,970
a neat little case study now I'm going

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,220
to turn it over to Michael Potter yeah

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,529
I'll try to try to pull that one out so

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,850
Oh r-right so now the really cool stuff

00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:36,529
while you're all here obviously so how

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,870
many front-end developers out there how

00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,639
many people implementing headless stuff

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,289
thinking about implementing headless

00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:46,519
stuff so I'm going to take you to a

00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:49,509
little journey so as we said we we run

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:53,149
Elms an amazing system Delta federated

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,620
system to talk to one another so

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:56,480
naturally what we do is we get these

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,340
crazy ideas that come across our plate

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,470
in the College of Science we get a ton

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,470
of crazy ideas but they're all good

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,120
there that's what we love and you know

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,840
over the course of these ideas coming

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,419
with it coming to us I'm saying to Brian

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,700
you know we should just make app like

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,799
we're taking Drupal to the absolute

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,279
limit like what these people have in

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:21,590
mind our applications so I think we need

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,070
to start making applications that layer

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:28,759
on top of Drupal and so Brian said no

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:32,570
obviously and then I begged him and okay

00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:34,909
he he conceded so here here are desired

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,419
outcomes so what we wanted to do was

00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:41,360
change up the workflow a little bit so

00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:44,179
we wanted to use a headless development

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,850
workflow so that's the big big word the

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:49,610
buzzword right but it really is a really

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,220
cool workflow it will really change your

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,909
approach to developing web web

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,220
applications so we need that that's what

00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:01,580
we wanted to try out and the reason was

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,730
is obviously to create a better user end

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,490
user experience so again what these what

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,259
these people really want are Google

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,100
products that are sitting in their

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:18,110
courses so made by one person the name

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:20,269
of one right all right so so what we

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,820
decide to do is obviously we needed to

00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:24,620
get off the island a little bit and you

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,080
know explore some some frameworks out

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,559
there we were pretty familiar with

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,460
angularjs which in layman's terms is

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,519
angular one

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,600
don't say angularjs anymore to an

00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:41,120
angular developer the touchy subject so

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,650
I did a lot of research and I really

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,870
like to what angular2 was doing is a

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,780
very opinionated framework and I think

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,120
that to get ramped up going from not

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,460
having done any of this to doing a full

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,370
application we needed some some guidance

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,990
there so we picked angular 2 and we went

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,480
with it and you know within a few a few

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:06,290
weeks we had a pretty good working demo

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:10,400
so this was an idea to build on top of

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,080
an existing profile in our system which

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,660
is the assignment studio so the

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,420
instructor would have a place to go and

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,190
easily create projects easily create

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,110
assignments within those projects for

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,580
their students the students could go

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,340
there and have a really slick interface

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,309
to add blog posts and comment on each

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,140
other's work and share files obviously

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,800
this brought in like state management

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,330
issues so went with Rita which is

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,290
horrendously complicated but works very

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,309
well so this is what you get and

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,370
whenever we're talking about improving

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:45,880
the develop developer experience look

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,730
how cool this is I can then you know

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,820
upload my Redux file here and then I can

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,730
fly through the I can time travel back

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,380
in time and it's cool so this is this

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,370
gave us a really good win we were easily

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,770
able to to crank out this this demo for

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:07,370
the for the instructor pretty quickly

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:10,070
everybody is really excited about it we

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,750
we go we implement a custom API because

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,950
for headless applications you need a

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:19,490
really good API so we spent countless

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,850
hours debating and designing and you

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,650
know what formats that go into but we

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,559
got that all figured out

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,900
angular has a really good C it CLI so

00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,850
naturally we started using that as web

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,520
pack it says all your bundling and

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:38,450
everything tree shaking which is the

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,630
thing so then naturally we learn tight

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:44,270
scripts then to make everything a lot

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,570
easier so we learned that whole new

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,310
language so this is our assignment and I

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,260
see all the properties and they're very

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,880
well defined and my my

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,810
my application knows exactly what's

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,330
going on I have a services file so this

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,700
is this is where I'm telling annular how

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,730
to connect with Drupal and it's in one

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,880
place so this is Angus I meant service

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,100
so I know what to do there so then we

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,860
had to use redux which angular has

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:18,570
specific versions for this so this is

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,740
ngrs that is redux built in angular it

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,310
gets better

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,410
so each setup you'll learn redux okay

00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,410
and you set up your reducer so this is

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,210
assignment reducer okay and then you

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,370
create your reusable components and this

00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,990
is this is a cool part like so these

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,240
frameworks you can create reusable

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,430
components we can build components on

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,670
each other and reuse them it's super

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,440
awesome so this is assignment - list

00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,630
components out HTML where every time I

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,140
use assignment - list it will render

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,030
this template really easily naturally

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,370
since we're using Redux I have to tell

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,090
Redux I should tell my application that

00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,310
redux

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,040
notice the change and it needs to tell

00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,630
Drupal because they need to be

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,280
communicating so naturally you do that

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,100
through reductive effects so that's a

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,200
assignments - effect and you put all

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,450
your effects in there and then you

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,730
compile it with the CLI CLI is really

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,900
nice it takes care of all that so you

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,640
get a disk file you get about 25 file

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,950
they're all minified and bundles and

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,960
stuff like that it's really slick and

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,450
then you import that into Drupal so you

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,980
create a module and you look through the

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,090
dist directory find all the files you

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,720
have to put them in the in the right

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:34,800
order but you import the files and then

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:41,760
you create your oh we have to add that's

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:44,010
the app that's right so hook menu at CLI

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,930
you give it a path and then you put app

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:51,150
- root and then you reload the page and

00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,560
you have a application to angular

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,560
application running side report

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,479
[Applause]

00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,479
[Music]

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:14,080
so let's cover the pros of this approach

00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:22,720
thank you my water please you can

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:29,799
applaud too so we did that over the

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:31,110
course of four months so the pros we can

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,270
definitely create the app experience

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:39,070
angular knows what it's doing it's built

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:41,649
for that it's perfect clear separation

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:46,390
of concerns Drupal has an API is a

00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:48,730
pretty cool concept it makes keeping

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,649
your your logic separated so you don't

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,760
have logic leading over into the front

00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:56,770
end and vice-versa you can create the

00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,500
well-designed API that you're looking

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,289
for that you have to spend that time and

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,169
angular 2 is really awesome it's like

00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:08,110
it's a lot to learn but typescript is is

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:12,880
pretty useful the CLI is definitely very

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:16,270
useful so this workflow is obviously not

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,690
ideal right you have to maintain two

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:23,340
different frameworks angular is a beast

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:27,159
and and it takes a long time to grok so

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:30,640
Drupal is the same way so you have to

00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,500
you have to deal with that going mostly

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,020
headless is difficult so as you see we

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,950
had an application running inside of

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:43,210
Drupal that brings a lot of workflow

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:47,409
issues as you saw but going completely

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:50,320
headless is also very difficult so as

00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:52,720
soon as you start dealing with dynamic

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,909
forms for the first time in your

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,679
headless application you're going to

00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:01,960
rethink everything Andy so obviously you

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,100
need to create a new development

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,860
workflow that fits what what you are

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,840
trying to do

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,010
so what did we like so we had a lot of

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,180
lessons learned from this

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:17,620
so separation of concerns as I said your

00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,160
plays an API we really like that

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,900
headless aiming so awesome it's really

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,400
cool

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,530
unidirectional data flow whenever you

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,780
get into component architecture you'll

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,020
pretty quickly figure this out that

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,800
managing state is ridiculously hard for

00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:37,870
some reason a component architecture

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,000
being able to reuse components and be

00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,710
able to design components specifically

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,070
for one thing and knowing that they're

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:47,440
going to be reused in other components a

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,900
documentation so whatever whatever you

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,450
choose make sure that you can rely on

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,220
documentation angular has really really

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,220
good documentation like I said I got

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,470
ramped up with angular 2 in like three

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,100
weeks I was building the first prototype

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:05,140
which with everything that has changed

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:10,570
in that ealer it's pretty it's pretty

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:12,820
cool so this is the end of the web as we

00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,910
knew it this is the new design paradigm

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:20,410
that we knew that we had to figure out

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:23,380
how to do so our desired outcomes for

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:25,870
this create a headless authoring

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,760
environment streamlines being workflows

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,650
we content modeling design first

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,200
eliminate as much triple theming as

00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,840
possible eliminate the theme from

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,290
blocking upgrades which was also very

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,620
big for us so in other words save Drupal

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:45,430
right cliche

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:48,670
yeah but how all right this is where you

00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:52,810
guys start cheering - it's like it's so

00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,350
happy so we think that this is the

00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,410
solution

00:31:53,350 --> 00:32:01,030
so of web components how many people are

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,740
familiar with web components oh cool

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,170
before I before I dive into web

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,270
components I I want to sort of lay out

00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,010
some some groundwork here so whenever I

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,680
say web component I'm not talking about

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,360
pattern lab I'm sort of talking about

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,130
pattern lab but I'm not talking about

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,830
pattern

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:19,559
and I'll explain so what pattern lab

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,780
does is first of all pattern lab is

00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,960
amazing it's awesome if you're building

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,690
in pattern lab to thumbs up what it's

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,429
doing is it's forcing you to build

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,230
components the right way so getting

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:36,419
building components down to their

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:38,640
absolute what do they call atoms and so

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,090
it's on the screen okay yeah it looks

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,220
like this tiny so so the starting the

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,900
the smallest point you designed for that

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,900
and you keep building you keep building

00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,880
and keep building that we think I think

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,330
that that's the perfect way of going

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,390
about it

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:56,669
well pattern lab doesn't give you is it

00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,090
doesn't give you a predictable API

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:02,309
there's no API in that it's it's you're

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,220
designing it the correct way but these

00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:08,490
components aren't smart they're they're

00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,520
just they're just markup right web

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:15,030
components is a spec it's going to be a

00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:19,320
standard it's already here so what web

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:22,260
components are are they're a set of

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,140
api's that allow you to create new

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,570
custom reusable encapsulated HTML tags

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,570
and the use of web pages and web apps

00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,000
sounds like pattern lab right but the

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:36,480
API is the key point that's the key

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,909
difference let's take an example so

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,730
awesome explosion so let's say that you

00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:45,120
wanted to create this awesome explosion

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,400
on your web site so if this were if we

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,309
were to construct this in web components

00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,830
we'd want to use a new tag like so like

00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:55,559
a div or a span we wanted to create our

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:59,549
own awesome - explosion anywhere we use

00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,610
this this explosion shows up so now

00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:04,260
picture that we want to manipulate it a

00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,260
little bit so we want to say you can you

00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:11,250
can change your size - so you could say

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:14,550
size kind of your site small what if you

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,190
wanted to change the color what if you

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:20,490
wanted to put HTML content inside of it

00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,760
and really importantly what if you

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,139
wanted to notify your website's that

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,830
things were happening inside the

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,400
computed

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:31,470
so this is what we mean by an API it

00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,590
will have you can define properties on

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:38,910
your components and you can emit events

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,470
from your component so a parent can

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,480
communicate with the child your

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,640
properties and a child can communicate

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,370
with its parent through events and

00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,890
that's the unidirectional data flow that

00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,710
I was talking about so the web component

00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:55,380
spec it's made up of four things

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:59,160
templates custom elements shadow DOM and

00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,110
HTML imports so as you can see Chrome

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,960
and opera they're they've already

00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,790
implemented it so you can you can use

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,200
these without any polyfills right now

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:13,130
today the the rest of the of the vendors

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,550
are still working through it they have

00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:19,410
to my understanding they have they're

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,940
all on board with this concept they're

00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,390
still working through the minutiae like

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,650
HTML imports some of them aren't sure

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,100
moving forward that that's the best move

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,980
so they're still discussing it but we

00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,450
can use web components right now so

00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,550
there's a project called polymer and

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,100
it's by the Google team and the purpose

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,050
of this the polymer project is to get

00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,100
people familiar with building websites

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,950
with components with web components so

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,540
it's it's polyfills to make sure it can

00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,180
run in every browser right now so you

00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,250
can use them today it has things like

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,820
lifecycle hooks to make them easier to

00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,950
work with and some fantastical sugar

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:04,080
stuff built on top sort of like how

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:05,430
jQuery is the JavaScript all right so as

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,280
an example of something that was just

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,170
built the new Google Earth was just

00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,180
launched built entirely with web

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,340
components so if you go there and check

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,830
it out right click on it and you'll see

00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:20,730
a whole bunch of what components in

00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:22,950
there so let's walk through an example

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,440
of what this might look like in and how

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:32,490
we can fit this into our workflow I'm

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,920
sorry so in in February with anyone at

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:41,289
Drupal Camp New Jersey in February

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:44,200
so during the sprint we had talked about

00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:46,749
this concept we just we were seeing how

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,640
the angular app was getting and we were

00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:50,650
trying to come up with some alternatives

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,460
and we took a look at polymer and we

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,950
said you know what

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,559
I think we think this might work let's

00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:59,380
see if we can try to get some prototypes

00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:02,289
working so within about three hours

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,230
Brian just wrote the module so thank you

00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:08,160
Brian

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:10,720
so the web components module and d0 and

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,339
the web components module is pretty

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,339
slick it does a couple things so it

00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:17,380
tells Drupal how to import these these

00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:19,690
web components but then what it also

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,029
does is it reads the properties that you

00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,579
define on your web components and it

00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:26,609
creates them as entities in Drupal which

00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:31,029
should get everybody very happy

00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:31,809
thank you Brian again so um let's look

00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:35,829
at an example

00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:38,619
so this is our Drupal site and we have

00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:40,480
an article and this is being rendered by

00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:43,180
a view and very now it's just rendering

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,489
the teaser View mode I think so how

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:49,930
would we get this rendered through our

00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:52,720
web components so first we recreate the

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,579
Elm Dylan - hero web component you can

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,319
really easily do this with polymer they

00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:58,980
have like a little tiny CLI that

00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,380
scaffolds a bunch of stuff for you so

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,059
inside of that one file we had those

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,509
four things that we talked about we have

00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:11,710
the HTML imports we had the template we

00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:14,680
have the the instantiation the the

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:21,039
custom web component spec and then we

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:23,650
had some some scope CSS and what that

00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,170
will give you is through the magic of

00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,789
polymer and it's CLI it will take that

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,009
file and it will create some

00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:33,279
documentation for you and some demos for

00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:36,430
you which is pretty cool and again this

00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:38,920
is just this is just in one one folder

00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:42,579
so what polymer will do is will create a

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:46,210
folder for you it will create the Enzo

00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:48,049
and Dutch hero file as well some tests

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,150
and a

00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:52,789
file for you so you could really easily

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,099
communicate and share that's one

00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:57,019
component so the second thing that you

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,670
do is you would turn on the web

00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,809
components module obviously that has a

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:07,339
couple sub modules like interacting with

00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:11,719
display sweet and polymer as well as

00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:13,339
setting up some display modes so what I

00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,739
would do is if I didn't want to touch

00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:18,589
the template files or anything I just

00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:21,769
wanted to go I just wanted to really

00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:25,509
easily wire up my article content type

00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:28,549
to my eldalonde - hero web component

00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:31,969
just within the interface this is what I

00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:35,539
do I'd go to manage display you can see

00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:37,069
a bunch of view modes those are all web

00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:40,130
components so these are the web

00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:41,749
components that it's found in that the

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,449
web components module found in the web

00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:48,039
components directory one of them is Elms

00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:50,029
L&S hero and if you notice it

00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,279
automatically picked up on those

00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:55,910
properties that we defined in the HTML

00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:58,640
file so so we can read those properties

00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:02,119
since we're since it uses that really

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,429
well defined API the web components is

00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,869
API it knows that we can read off

00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:12,859
properties so what you do is for each

00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:14,929
one of those you just like you would any

00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:17,689
other site with display suite you just

00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:19,249
drag your fields into place so the image

00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:22,579
goes into the image field and the title

00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:24,589
goes into the title field etc from there

00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,630
like we said we were displaying that

00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:29,329
article through views you would just

00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:35,719
change the view mode to eldalonde hero

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:38,390
and bam there you go so what we did was

00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:41,900
we completely bypassed the Drupal theme

00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,640
layer without Cody or without doing

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,679
anything in the templates or thingsit's

00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,269
we just told your bolt these are the

00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,309
properties here's the fields you should

00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:52,929
send into those properties the web

00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:52,929
component will handle handle the rest

00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,400
what do you think

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,750
[Applause]

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,589
which message would you rather do the

00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:10,579
angular version of that version all

00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:13,140
right so the program is approach

00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:15,119
separation of concerns yep headless

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,030
theming absolutely unidirectional data

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,960
flow yep component act architecture of

00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:24,030
course documentation of course and the

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:30,210
big one that's what this is a game

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:33,599
changer framework interoperability this

00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:36,200
component is currently being used could

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:41,549
potentially be used in all these

00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:44,670
frameworks at the same time so if you

00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:49,589
wanted to update the Elm Dylan hero

00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:51,329
across your entire portfolio

00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:57,410
you could change it one time in an

00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:57,410
update like that pretty cool

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,279
so the cons of this approach obviously

00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:08,819
browser support so if you are doing

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:09,299
anything under ie 11 it's not going to

00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:14,240
work

00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:17,549
so you have to make that decision so um

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,750
that brings us to what we were talking

00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:26,730
with with the same Drupal so what are we

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,180
saving Drupal from so as anyone sees

00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,230
Ness

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:35,760
this is Gutenberg the Gutenberg demo

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:39,420
from WordPress pretty slick huh so this

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,880
is like an in-place editor you can

00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,359
create different stuff you change the

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,539
heading you can push this wide and off

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,390
to the side here just pretty cool so

00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:52,619
it's just a demo but this is what we're

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,500
going to have to compete against in the

00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,260
near future so whatever you're selling

00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:02,730
Drupal your clients are going to show

00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:05,270
you this and be like can we do this so

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,270
can you

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:14,390
so we definitely can we think that if we

00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,890
if we dot the web components and we

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,630
learned from the other communities that

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,150
are also contributing to web components

00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,650
outside of Drupal we can all contribute

00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,579
together and come up with some really

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,989
cool solutions we started a git repo

00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,420
called lriend

00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:35,579
web components for their super learning

00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,200
web components and what we did is for

00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,739
these web components what we said is

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,900
they're going to have a design and

00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:45,359
they're also going to know how to edit

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,729
themselves so let's take a look at the

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,200
panel card so this is this is just a

00:43:47,729 --> 00:43:54,059
card that you could throw on your

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,369
website but what if this were inside the

00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:00,539
body of your website and you could hover

00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:03,289
over it and you could let me up a little

00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:06,869
bit you can hover over a little edit

00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:13,380
thing and you could in place edit that

00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:21,599
and you could change the color oh that

00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:23,519
was good yeah change the elevation all

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,529
that was perfect I'll go ahead and hit

00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:29,999
save so this is what we have in mind so

00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:32,880
each of these would have their own edit

00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:34,859
State the Drupal website would only be

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,160
in charge of putting these components

00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:40,349
into their edit state you would edit

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,109
them whenever you click Save these

00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:45,630
components would through events notify

00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:48,029
Drupal hey I just updated I need you to

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:53,459
go ahead and update the content that I'm

00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:57,170
on via restful web services we can take

00:44:53,459 --> 00:45:01,019
a look at here's a here's a block quote

00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:03,499
so again changing properties like that

00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:07,289
outset yeah that looks really good okay

00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:10,730
you can show like a little off-screen

00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:14,990
canvas thing yep that looks really good

00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:17,570
go ahead and save that so this this is

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,820
what we're thinking I think we can build

00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,190
our our Drupal sites including these web

00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:28,000
components so that we can start giving

00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:28,000
our users these really slick interfaces

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:38,180
LR drawer icon didn't show up so Drupal

00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:41,060
doesn't know doesn't have to know about

00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:43,550
this this can all be offloaded on the

00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,190
browser which is really really cool

00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:49,460
so forget about like the plug-in

00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,680
architecture of this one javascript

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,500
library has to have a plugin for Drupal

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,150
and for WordPress insists that if it

00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:05,300
goes through web components it will be

00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:09,500
interoperable so let me hop back into my

00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,720
presentation so here are some relevant

00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,550
links web components org it's a library

00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,080
of web components and open-source

00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:17,030
developers and huge companies

00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,500
contributing their libraries to web

00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,740
components that you can use right now

00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,630
and we are using right now polymer

00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,950
project is definitely if you want to get

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,340
started with web components I highly

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:31,760
recommend that we have some posts on

00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,609
drupal.org and once Drupal da video and

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,030
some Dolan org about how we might how

00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:40,910
we're thinking about using those and

00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:42,470
really important I hope that if you're

00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,570
interested please come to our boss

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:48,830
tomorrow because there's a lot of things

00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:51,109
to think about there's a lot of things

00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,609
to consider and talk through and we

00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:54,890
definitely want to hear hear your

00:46:52,609 --> 00:47:00,830
thoughts though and maybe build some web

00:46:54,890 --> 00:47:12,239
components so that that's what we have

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:12,239
[Applause]

00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:31,380
any question that guy so great

00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:33,060
presentation great job both of you we

00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,490
saw at the end there a couple of

00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:40,500
components where the focus seemed to be

00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:42,240
on the editing process so I kind of a

00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,850
look at this people are having out two

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,790
questions actually have you looked into

00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:52,110
creating components that dealt directly

00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:54,480
with ripples API first stuff and have

00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:59,370
you looked at more administrative side

00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:02,250
components so we haven't actually hoped

00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:04,590
those edits face up to a back-end of any

00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,830
kind yet because we're just trying to

00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:10,140
focus on what would the UX pattern be if

00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:13,380
we had just a totally native experience

00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,540
for them I would see the plug into the

00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,420
hook up to Drupal being similar almost

00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:21,330
to the edit edit module from triple7

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,640
lands that got port that is in v8 core

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,740
with the in-place editing as far as you

00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,080
know find something put it in that quick

00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,780
edit mode make the change and hit those

00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,550
API endpoints or something like that

00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,100
what was the second question other

00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,200
administrative side low administrate we

00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,230
haven't haven't really able to settings

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:43,150
pane so there's the reading

00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,370
so no we haven't looked into the into

00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,280
those but I mean that's the application

00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:51,430
that works perfectly good I mean they

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,180
are so another thing that we didn't show

00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,830
I had to add last week where we're

00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,950
leaving I had to add an administrative

00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:01,480
dashboard to that angular app and I

00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,760
tried to do with the angular way to just

00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,900
what we gonna have work flows like I

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,350
didn't want to touch it

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:12,880
so I I created a polymer component that

00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:15,160
retrieves a list of stuff added some

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,670
retrieve the list of submissions added

00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,340
some settings and some administrative

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:24,550
functionality and I implement that in a

00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:28,210
few hours and that that I think if we

00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:31,240
can the the administrative panels

00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,980
interval I think is perfect for I just I

00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,800
think it's way better than going with

00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,840
another framework another you know large

00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,830
framework to solve that problem I think

00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:47,050
it's perfect I was just wondering do you

00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:50,140
have the web component module ready for

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,940
d8 already so that was why I said oh

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,530
yeah you talked to the microphone so

00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,020
he's been working on porting it to d8

00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:01,660
which I have you used it yet in any

00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:04,600
regard or still bolita so the dealers

00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:09,210
printing on it he has the eight dev dev

00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:12,340
branch for it but yeah I mean exact

00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:14,470
model is doing is bridging scanning it

00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,240
and bridging the energy of skimming it

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,040
off and turning it into entities as

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,460
opposed to doing any real deep design

00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:24,460
integration so the goal

00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,530
yeah good job with your presentation I

00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:29,950
wanted to ask a question about a hero

00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:32,650
component it was that a new field type

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:37,000
or it just like a template for the image

00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:39,760
field type so the the image specifically

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,210
in the hero it was just an image field

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,210
and the I changed the formatter to

00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:48,670
output it as just the URL because the

00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:52,690
web component itself was just looking

00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:55,089
for the image URL okay so the here

00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,400
component was just a formatter for for

00:50:55,089 --> 00:51:00,190
the image field for the image field type

00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,740
so the the hero the what the web

00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:04,930
components module did was it recognized

00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,510
that we had a web component named hero

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:11,710
and it created a View mode for it

00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:14,079
the within that view mode we specified

00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:17,470
what fields should render through which

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,390
properties in the web component so if

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:24,430
you think of it like view mode so each

00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:32,829
view mode is a what component wonderful

00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:35,470
thank you guys all right going back

00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:40,480
Bryan 2x API and you gave the example of

00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:42,730
video how how does the video triggering

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,040
actions the X API are using like it the

00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,380
video players JavaScript API or how do

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:52,000
you detect start/stop pause jump ahead

00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:55,030
so there is a I don't actually know if

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,880
there's the tin can API underscore media

00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:00,910
or video I think they support media

00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,430
module natively and so that then it's

00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,990
wired up to the player for the html5

00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,839
player and it's listening to the html5

00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:10,660
events if it's in place on the website

00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,549
if it's in the example shown in that

00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,730
little demo that's from YouTube so that

00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:18,099
it's using the YouTube API and basically

00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:21,839
the workflow is replicate mirror the

00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:24,329
event and then reroute it through a

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,319
fluid like tin-can

00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:27,910
submission type of a thing the Hyp

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,849
module works that way as well because

00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:32,470
the Hyp module is list it's going I have

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:33,680
an event and then the tin can things

00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,660
like I have best

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,270
thing to do about that but then what it

00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,550
does is it sends it back into Drupal via

00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:43,880
a system Ajax calls and then that

00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:46,609
callback sends it on the backend over to

00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,410
the LRS so using that work we basically

00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:52,130
been doing that with everything that we

00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:54,319
integrated with that also starts to play

00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,329
into the web components side of things

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,859
because we could make we're talking

00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:02,210
about making a like X - API tag

00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:05,030
literally all it does is like hey

00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,130
property verb hey property who did it

00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:10,040
right and if we pass that stuff in now

00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,990
we start integrating X API even easier

00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,970
than already is it's already pretty easy

00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:18,140
this new beta X API there's so many

00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:20,000
libraries for it but yeah um we're going

00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:23,809
with fire into presentations or the

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,119
material fit so almost all of these are

00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:30,559
have blog posts of some form associated

00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:33,619
with them on either Drupal psu.edu or al

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,170
with this website the elms ln org in the

00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:38,349
blog section the presentation as a whole

00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:40,520
we have to it's too big to upload to the

00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:43,040
website directly but we will put it up

00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,049
there probably putting putting these on

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,440
YouTube or something so the presentation

00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:51,130
will be up there yeah it is yeah this is

00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,130
why

00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:58,630
