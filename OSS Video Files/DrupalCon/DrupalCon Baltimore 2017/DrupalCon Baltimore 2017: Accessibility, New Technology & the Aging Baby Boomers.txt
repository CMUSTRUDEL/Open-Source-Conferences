Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Accessibility isn’t just for the blind or deaf. Accessibility is for everyone. Our eyes, ears, and motor function won’t get better with age.

Accessible design improves usability for everyone, and it increases SEO and market size for every website, and that matters more now than ever. With a technologically competent and aging Baby Boomer population, we are expecting previously unseen numbers of users who will demand accessible experiences, and we’re here to help you understand how to create them.

Takeaways:

An updated understanding of what accessibility is and whom it is for
Experience websites through a screen-reader on a non-compliant, as well as a compliant website.
Walk through a time and budget-saving method for creating closed captions.
Learn about the long-term benefits of accessible design to improve web experiences for all users
Gain insight into the great opportunities and requirements for voice control
Articulate the upcoming / new Section 508 Refresh and how it may impact your work.

mentioned I'm Katherine I lost my

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,449
hearing to meditators when I was 8

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,520
months old and I was one of the first

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,579
recipients of the cochlear implant which

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,190
is a a technological implantable device

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,890
so I've been a technology pioneer my

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,180
whole life so it's been really cool so

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,270
I've grown up enough with their

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,760
computers and I'm really excited to talk

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,790
about how meeting Navis technology to

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,840
grid communities and equal the playing

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,790
field for everybody David hi I'm David

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,920
Spira my background and accessibility

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,460
started when I was 16 years old when I

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,900
volunteered to build a computer lab at

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,590
the retirement home and teach the people

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,360
living there how to use them and got a

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,650
immediate and startling crash course on

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,009
accessibility we both work for phase 2

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,399
where a were a digital agency we design

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,040
develop and do a whole bunch of awesome

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,630
things for various web properties we're

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,220
hiring we have a really interesting

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,340
booth downstairs so you should

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,219
definitely come check it out

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,670
dive on in the elderly are going to

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,680
outnumber those under the age of 5 by

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,240
2020 this is the thing that hasn't

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,009
happened before in history so while they

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,379
aren't making new new ones the baby

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,000
boomers are the largest you know the

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,390
largest segment and the elderly or the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
fast

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,100
growing segments in America at the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,140
moment and this is happening throughout

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,930
the Western world they make up 15% of

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,200
the population and this is a group that

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,090
you cannot afford to ignore because 68

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,740
percent of baby boomers and please folks

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,709
come on in there's plenty of seating up

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,130
front if you want 68 percent of baby

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,190
boomers have multiple devices these are

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:45,030
folks over the age of 55 and you know

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,770
they're used to using them as they start

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,550
to age they are not like their parents

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,830
generation who generally didn't care

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,930
about use of technology these are people

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,190
who are expecting to use technology

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,680
until they're gone so don't treat them

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,230
like you but you know from a web design

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,480
standpoint like the previous elderly

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,400
generation who genuinely didn't care so

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,410
on top of that you have this group of

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,950
one in five Americans who have a

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,420
disability now this map that you're

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,769
seeing here doesn't mean much for

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,290
accessibility but just to give you a

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,250
frame of reference this is each state

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,870
redrawn according to its population and

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,400
if we were to go and take a look at the

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,320
population of people in America with

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,440
disabilities it's seven times the

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,610
population of the state of New York so

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,030
this is a large amount of people one in

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,680
five Americans sort of one in five

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,420
Americans have a disability and half of

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,160
them need some kind of assistance

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,440
navigating a website so that's ten

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,440
percent of the population essentially

00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,630
are these is this do you want to ignore

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,140
ten percent of the population and then

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:06,480
on top of that you have temporary

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,019
disabilities friend of mine went

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,380
snowboarding had a very interesting fall

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,729
and left the hospital with both of his

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,950
hands and casts these things happen

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,890
people have strokes people encounter all

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,650
sorts of unexpected ailments that change

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,190
the way that they see and into here and

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,460
interact

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,830
with the world so this is not just for

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,780
some nice group of people we're talking

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,270
when we talk about accessibility we're

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,650
talking about everybody we're talking

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,360
about the elderly we're talking about

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,070
people who have the disability to

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,250
commonly associate with accessibility

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,410
and we're talking about people who are

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,600
living functional lives without any

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,650
impairments who suddenly find themselves

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,280
in need of accessibility this is truly

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,110
for everyone so let's talk a little bit

00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,670
about color blindness and if you've ever

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,790
attended one of our talks one of the

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,890
things that we really focus on is

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,140
reframing disability and helping people

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,800
find you know find an empathic

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,700
connection to these problems so color

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,300
blindness affects half a percent of

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,010
women it's a color blindness its genetic

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,510
but it affects approximately 8% of men

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,260
so that's an important thing to note if

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,140
you operate a website that is targeting

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,890
men you're talking about 8% of your

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,419
audience is colorblind McCullough's

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,030
colorblind the simulator is the thing

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,830
I'm a really big fan of because what it

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,730
does is it allows you to upload images

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,020
and then simulate most of the different

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,600
types of colorblindness that are out

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,240
there and see what your designs look

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,210
like through the eyes of someone else

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,560
literally so on the left you're going to

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,370
see a normal image on the right you're

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,770
going to see a different type of

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,090
colorblindness it's worth noting there

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:06,000
are lots of different types of

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:10,770
colorblindness so red week this is what

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,240
red blind looks like blue blind and then

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,320
black and white which is the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,730
stereotypical but incredibly rare

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,070
colorblindness but most people I think

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,600
think of when they're when people talk

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,850
about colorblindness this isn't actually

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,850
a very common form of it see if

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,290
it's going okay so this is the code

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,670
let's color blind the simulator so you

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,970
can just upload an image this is

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,010
humanitarian ID and app that I worked on

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,470
for about a year and this is what it's

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,030
looking like through the eye through

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,420
different types of color blindness you

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,180
can very quickly easily and for

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,100
absolutely no money upload screenshots

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,730
of your designs of your existing

00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,520
websites and run them through and see

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,600
what they look like for different types

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,060
of colorblindness and what you're

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,740
looking for is not this you know mystic

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,450
like perfect brand experience for

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,490
further colorblind you're not going to

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,860
achieve that what you are looking for is

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,720
making sure that you can actually read

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,370
and see everything that's relevant on

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,770
the page the great thing about

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,800
technology is that it can enable

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,200
independent living people who have a

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,720
wheelchair or who are blind or who have

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,310
here lost to new technology to get where

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,430
they need if you think about someone

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,770
who's blind they can use Alexa at home

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,020
to call uber without having to rely on

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,230
somebody else to drive them somewhere so

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,350
they can never technology to advance the

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,120
to make their lives easier one thing

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,190
that I just kind of my talk about a very

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,850
I might experience when thinking about

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,950
your website in Hoonah serving in future

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,650
audience in thinking about that you

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,480
would be amazed at what kinds of sites

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,480
are encounter and the customer service

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,790
that I experience I just want to talk to

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,870
you about um the experience I had a year

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,760
ago when my cochlear implants broke and

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,640
let me tell you when they break I can't

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,890
hear a thing I can't come to work I

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,410
can't talk to my family I can't talk to

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,710
my friends I can't hear them so it's a

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,870
very distressing experience so I have a

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,850
lot of turning map of what was going on

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,070
with my processors football program I

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,680
was you know really low emotion of

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,169
things that she'd I can't function I

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,030
can't be productive my project is broken

website the hey the different access

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,409
form good but I can't call them so I was

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,500
able to go on the website

response was give me a call

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:16,170

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,050
of bummer and out really negatively

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,910
impacted me as a person and made me feel

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,089
like I still needed somebody to help me

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,089
I couldn't be this alone I can adult by

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,959
myself so but not let's look at the

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:45,339
ideal experience and what the ultimate

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,500
experience Kurt have been so as you can

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:52,689
see my purchase is broken and I'm

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:56,560
waiting I'm anxious so and the response

00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:58,779
I get is hey so I is broken fear is

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,259

immediately replacement ASAP usually

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,439
they open a database and in the

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,639
meanwhile I still need to go to my

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:20,290
clinic to literally get my hearing

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,540
reprogrammed they put me up to a

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,089
computer and then I get a new program

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,720
from a processors so I had to go to my

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,579
audiologist website remember I can't

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,860
hear anything

00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:36,399
thankfully turns Hopkins who's just down

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,319
the road said hey use our online booking

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,360
calendar to book an appointment with a

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,250
doctor and there was great because I can

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,069
see all the available times that my

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,490
doctor to see me as well as mine so that

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:51,069
create a much more hominid experience

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,790
and the great thing was fading call me

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:57,460
to confirm they confirmed me in the same

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,700
when I reached out to them by text means

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,920
so they texted me the hain appointments

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,180
been confirmed or seen on Thursday that

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,600
was good because they didn't call me

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,550
which would have gone unanswered so and

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,860
you know in the great thing is my doctor

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,680
saw me initially sent me a follow-up

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,110
email to say hey hope is rocky are great

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,360
so this is a really important experience

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,100
we need to think about our audience who

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,470
know surveying and think about the

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,350
response and how only receiving that

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,840
audience are you able to access them are

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,570
you able to give them the means to get

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,060
in touch with you and I'm so really

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,390
money talking about our like teacher

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,420
feeding your digital experience what all

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,150
those are temporarily disabling

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,190
conditions are they going to be able to

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,290
do to say if they don't know how to do

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,650
describe either where they don't go the

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,350
keyboard shortcuts all those clipped

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,930
itís easy to bind is it easy to

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,670
understand the web experience thinking

00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,230
about those experiences because not

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,460
everybody's didn't know how to need to

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:06,460
scream either right off the bat now I've

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,250
kind of want to go through some some

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:13,480
experiences that emulate what is play

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,820
for somebody you can't see a skiing and

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,250
so we're gonna I'm going through a quick

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,830
exercise I'm going to be playing an

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,650
audio description of an image and I want

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:37,680
you to try to visualize what that image

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:37,680
is so image man washing hands oh dear

00:12:40,350 --> 00:13:16,240
image man washing ham image image man

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:17,920
Washington all right come to mind

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,990
really think about ready here man wash

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,680
your hands think it'd be a lot of

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,640
different images light did it look

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,589
something like this

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,720
I doubt it she thought of a certain

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,870
washing his hands let me see your hands

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,890
I didn't think so now let's talk about

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,959
writing a good or text description now

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,620
one thing I love to do is think about

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:48,339
our text like a tweet sure to sink into

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,730
the point now in that image I decide to

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,899
how about Sunday late your doctor in

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:59,829
scrubs sort of a cap in masks works on

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,760
as others up treat others with soap to

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,730
prepare for surgery

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,490
the swore descriptive the man wash your

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,000
hands mean to say good I'm going to

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,579
agree so consider think about while

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,029
without image chosen what was the

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,130
context of that image why did someone on

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,990
the content marketing team play there is

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,920
an important image what does it

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,750
communicate what is it in bay and so

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,029
we're going to be ready to emotional

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,880
context of this and you appearing

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:36,130
website d1 and so you know hospital

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:41,649
patients that you care in hygienic so

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,470
we've got describes sociopath in mask so

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,870
surgical cap indicates day that appear

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,209
it's not very baseball cap window

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,140
surgery so it's important to say is a

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,940
surgical cap looks on me needs observant

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,790
either work you know he's ready to

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,390
prepare for surgery now there's up this

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:04,029
open elbows meaning that is hygienic

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:07,060
another important thing in preparation

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,829
for surgery in the case purpose so these

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,570
are very important quality you have an

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,820
image that you want to be able to

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,339
communicate or due to the screen reader

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,640
it means not just for screen readers is

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:23,740
creep SEO cynically beginning these on

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,200
the Harper Box a suit now let's do an

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,860
exercise together

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:33,160
miss write or text together so now the

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:37,029
context of this is a Red Cross Disaster

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,640

yeah

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,020
and you might need more time

00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm gonna start video some of the

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,710

we've got American Red Cross aid worker

00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:31,059
hiking devastated woman surrounded by

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:33,369
home wreckers under this guy that's very

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,159
good that indicates the disaster that

00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,720
happened in digital recovery process

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,840
they did we build in person so that's

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,220
that's definitely good description

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,889
Romanian breeze we leave Brooklyn with a

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,860

good far into a height flooding victim

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,320
ah could be a little bit more

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:56,789
descriptive because if the blood still

00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,409
going on you know we can't place help

00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,409
and then let's see where else is there

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:08,649
anybody else - like chiming from the

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,749

if you want to say if you have any other

00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:16,590
suggestions but I think the is really

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,269
about context and the context matters

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,039
thanks for participating there in the

00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,899

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:54,309
context of that or text links is another

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,470
another thing that is very challenging

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:03,519
and often times mission context a lot of

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:06,879
times we see links there are more clip

00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,769
here contact us but it doesn't have the

00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,620
context that we need to understand what

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:12,980
the link is

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:17,530
what it means so how many of you have

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,570
ever heard a screen reader before oh

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,490
that's a good number of you so I'm going

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,770
to play a series of videos that

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,610
immolates with a screen reader is saying

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,100
and again they just not be one-to-one

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,000
experience of somebody who just be

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:46,610
reader they may have the own shortcuts

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:49,280

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,120
you are currently on a link to a blank

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,910
image sling hi did you know were to

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,870
click on did you know when you clicked

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:22,130
on one more little no way that so there

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,740
is better way to do it

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,690
Newton you can actually make the links

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:32,809
mobile event you can add hidden element

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,110
that is vv to compact upon like the blog

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,720
title so is actually as a

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,450
compromise so as you can see on this

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,070
website it still says more but the

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,350
screen readers didn't give a more

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:52,910
context so hopefully I can get this

keyboard user may not always know if

00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:30,019
so one of six is helpful so I can see I

00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:32,260
will not go over one of six to its 6:50

00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,760
that helps them understand

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:43,540

thankfully all our digital Teva ball if

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,690
you know what our standards are and you

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,490
can actually implement them in tuner

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,640
website to make it easier for everybody

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:23,740
HT be a for mobile tablet as you be

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,400
deeper down the road when we start to

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,350
implement the police

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,570
automated technology state theory in

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,990
echo and a lot of really exciting stuff

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,240
so Willie where do you begin

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,750
not here though don't worry about it

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,320
it's okay just take a deep breath

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,770
because it is not as overwhelming as it

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,950
may seem really to take a step back and

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:54,220
think about a site identify the main

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,860
purpose of a site what only doing for

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,540
the audience and start there don't think

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,030
about every single thing they need to be

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,810
built right now is you save ecommerce

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:07,030
site if you can ecommerce site make sure

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:10,560
that the South the experience for

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:14,950
somebody users be read or keyboard is on

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,220
track the forms accessible they aren't

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,930
accessible in one of those touch points

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,020
more even use you're going to be doing

00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,640
in order to purchase those items they

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,180
could be building the builds are going

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,890
to be selecting a shopping cart and and

00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,650
then consider those accessibility

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,020
elements building you should understand

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,830
the build in the label the leadership

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,810
what they understand how do you check

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,620
out what they understand where to put a

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,850
credit card information and think about

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,530
those interactions

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,410
and how can you achieve those

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,740
accessibility purposes in them from

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:57,250
there what is it going to look like when

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,340
you have 10% increase in accessibility

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:03,070
by saying are we looking at 10% increase

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,800
revenue are we looking at 10% increased

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,020
memberships the opportunities are really

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,060
there for you to be able to make a

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,030
business case to talk with the platter

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,280
teams to talk with somebody who is in

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,640
terms of the spending for the site as a

00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,560
look me happy up to opportunity to

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,070
increase our revenue by making this

00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:27,400
accessible so that is a bottom line idea

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,400
and so boom there really is categorizing

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,470
by the interaction okay immunities are

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,630
not accessible okay what do we need to

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,930
do about it you just kind of go from

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,990
there and track them please is possible

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:44,710
for this the content editor is

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,230
responsible for quality or text the

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,410
developer is responsible for making sure

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,560
that the build is there for the content

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,960
editor to Berlin now in people 8 the alt

00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,840
text field is required by the box so

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,030
that didn't care for us in Drupal but we

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,070
need them I think that you see faster

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,920
before work so that we can communicate

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:09,130
in the backlog in prioritized we need to

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,620
happen in so from there you've done

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:18,370
audit in about prioritizing what are the

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,650
must-haves element who matched one must

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,720
be back to the tablet apart in order to

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,300
improve the experience and those really

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,850
focus on first and then once you've done

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,980
that leaving take a step back there okay

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,320
now we've done that we've released it

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,260
none our customers can purchase things

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,780
now Stage two is kind of making sure

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,300
that they're up to compliance where

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,940
there are not no part of our federal

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,120
funding site how many of you are

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,670
familiar with section 508 but they're

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,490
painful how about web content

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,830
accessibility guidelines very good about

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,980
equal number how many of you know that

00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,630
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,620
are now the new

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,480
to be stained of a second by the way

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,720
that's pretty cool so it's really

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,620
exciting so literally test of G weeks

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,200
ago the access board said hey Section

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,230
five away after ten years is finally

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,160
being updated section battery was when

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:25,429
in 1988 and this is way before modern

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,309
web technologies happened so the web

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:31,760
content accessibility guidelines is made

00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,470
of thought leaders who are the hey these

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,510
are the best practices that we should be

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,570
doing for the website today and they

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,640
kind of cut things up to be so P becomes

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,100
plain going to retire for best practices

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,289
section by the way in the meanwhile kind

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,070
of became updated really still the

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:51,860
federal standard but now the second

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,850
batteries kind of say look we recognized

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,130
for our days so let's look at web 2.0 I

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,950
thought would be the new standard and

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:06,530
that actually meant to give back most

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:09,679
22nd and by January January 18th 2018

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,350
better site must be in conformance with

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,020
the tag two point of Louisville a and

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,210
double-a so it's a lot of a lot of

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,400
really exciting stuff the actors on the

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,940
accessibility firm because we have being

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,370
these websites up to relevant in

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,880
accessibility in the modern technologies

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:32,320
not just the outdated levels and so it's

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,190
a great but a great opportunity and so

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:41,090
yeah okay so I want to talk about some

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,880
tools that can help you along the first

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,200
one is a I don't actually know how they

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,450
pronounce it whether it's totally or

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,059
towed to a lie either way it's a great

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,309
tool what this is is it was made by the

00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:55,460
Khan Academy and it is both a Chrome

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:59,080
extension and a Drupal module and it

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,659
basically is like accessibility vision

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,100
when you use it when you turn it on you

00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:07,179
get this little menu on the left side

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,980
that gives you a number of different

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:12,740
ways to scan the site for accessibility

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,280
now this is not perfect this is not you

00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,610
know if you need

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,200
to do a proper accessibility audit you

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,400
know this is not really going to help

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,870
you you're going to need to bring

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
someone on who actually knows what

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,890
they're doing and that's the thing we

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,760
can help you out with but if you are

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:31,280
looking for spot checks of content spot

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,440
checks of your site this is great it'll

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,430
allow you to view the alt text it will

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,950
allow you to you know check color

00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,230
contrast it just starts to overlay it

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,300
bear in mind that this has been there

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,340
they've been iterating on this it is a

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,900
little bit quirky at times like right

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,600
now you'll notice in the middle that it

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,510
is reading the background the contrast

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,800
on that button against the background

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,660
color not against the of the site that

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,960
blue area not against the white button

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,850
background color so it can be fooled but

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,340
you can take a look at the notes that it

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,660
brings up and you'll be able to identify

00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,810
that it just doesn't know what it's

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,600
talking about but that's just those are

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,820
few and far between

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,410
you know it's also useful for spotting

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,280
when you're not using proper semantic

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,840
structure it's useful for reading your

00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,520
site back to your sections of your site

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,100
back to you as a screen reader would

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,960
this is great because as you heard

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,390
before many many many websites torture

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,030
people who use screen readers so this is

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,920
a great way for you to do quick spot

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,570
checks and make sure that a screen

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:48,710
reader user won't hate you another tool

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,020
is ckeditor which is baked into Drupal 8

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,090
it is currently not enabled because

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,950
there are some security issues that

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,020
still need to be ironed out if anyone is

00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,140
in the room who could have an effect on

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,760
that you know maybe bump that up the

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,690
backlog but ckeditor is is

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,120
mind-bogglingly useful because as a

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:13,760
designer for accessibility and and

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,680
someone and our developers who handle

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,050
who handle it we can design and build

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,990
for accessibility and then it is

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,160
entirely upon the content manager to

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,930
actually see this through

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,610
so the sites that is perfectly designed

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,750
for accessibility and perfectly built

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,270
for accessibility

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,550
will completely collapse if you don't

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,730
have a content content management team

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,830
that is on top of it every single day

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,660
with every single word that they drop on

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,420
the site with every single image that

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:46,610
they put on the site ckeditor can really

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:50,140
truly help do this by putting in in

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,450
browser you know in WYSIWYG tools to

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,570
scan this this is so you hit a button it

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,990
brings up this and right now the first

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,940
thing that is spotted is that this image

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,400
doesn't have an alt text you'll notice

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,170
that it's got a quick fixed field right

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,780
in the middle of you know right right

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,000
there you can type in your alt text hit

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,200
quick fix and it will apply it you don't

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,100
have to go back and make any changes

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,620
it's literally there for you the next

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,630
one this is a having a hard time seeing

00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,930
on that angle this one is identifying

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:28,580
paragraphs module is being used to drop

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:30,770
headers instead of an h1 h2 h3 so that's

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,810
going to baffle a screen reader that is

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,390
trying to skim the site and provide an

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,280
overview you can do a quick fix right

00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:39,350
there it's giving you a drop-down asking

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,360
you which H you want you select the one

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:46,100
you want quick fix done the next one is

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,160
have noticed this is my favorite it

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,830
noticed that the editor didn't use you

00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,170
know proper markup to insert numbers

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:56,330
they they typed them in and it's just

00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,850
flashing it said hey fix this delete

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:02,000
those numbers lasso at all and then just

00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,560
hit hit hit numbers and it's fixed that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,400
one there is no quick fix because it's a

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,010
little bit more nuanced the next one

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,080
this is noticing that there was not from

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,770
proper semantic structure used someone

00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,930
jumped from an h1 to h3 skipping h2 it's

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:21,800
telling you what to do provides a quick

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:23,870
fix done and then this last one is

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,560
noticing this is my second favorite that

00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,600
the content editor has copied and pasted

00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,940
the image name into the alt text field

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,800
which is awful it is worse than having

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,140
no alt text because now a screen reader

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,000
is getting some you know screen reader

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,030
users getting some gibberish that

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,220
provides no context to them

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,160
quick fix again type in your alt text

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,720
and you're all good and then the last

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,150
one is tables oh yes tables this one is

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,830
noticing that the tables don't have

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,200
proper headings it allows you to select

00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,760
whether you want horizontal or vertical

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:05,150
quick fix done and last but not least we

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,530
have another adjacent links this one's

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,780
really cool

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,700
it picked up that there are two links

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,800
beside one another that are pointing at

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,930
the same place so a screen reader user

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,170
would end up hearing that URL twice in

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,350
this case if you hit quick fix it will

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:25,750
just merge those hyperlinks together so

00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:29,360
it removes the redundancy which is great

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,770
so again when you are auditing your site

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,240
when you're reviewing your site if

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,000
Katherine is saying what you want to be

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,920
doing is prioritizing you have to figure

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,110
out what makes your software what makes

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,260
your website important why are people

00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,170
going to it and focus your accessibility

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,940
efforts on that because accessibility as

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,640
we said in our talk last year it's a

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,760
journey not a destination you are not

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,920
going to achieve some level you know

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,420
some imaginary perfect accessibility

00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,330
that you never have to focus on it again

00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,310
but you should always keep in mind your

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,570
core functionality your core goals and

00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:07,550
your users core goals you know

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,610
prioritize what you need to make your

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,500
experience work that's stage one the

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,850
next is figuring out where you need what

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,530
you need to achieve from a regulatory

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,770
standpoint and if you don't have a

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,410
regulatory standing that you need to

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,600
achieve it's good to know what status

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,870
you're striving for you know single a

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,890
double a triple a because if you're

00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,180
really putting the effort into

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,000
accessibility you should make sure that

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,070
your user base is aware of it if you do

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,070
all of this and nobody knows it then

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,480
you've also kind of failed and then the

00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,710
last is figuring out where you're going

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,420
to iterate and again you should be

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,670
looking towards your core functionality

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,020
to figure out where it makes most sense

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,020
for you to put the effort in

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,859
you know focus on this and do it start

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,420
now if you haven't already because

00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,330
it's a long road and it's but it's a

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,510
road worth walking you need to do this

00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:04,790
you know for your users make sure that

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,240
they know that you actually you really

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:10,300
truly care about their experience about

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,160
their ability to access your information

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,510
in order to show this you want to make

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,780
sure that you're doing things like

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,609
providing tons of waves as many ways as

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,440
you possibly can in as many ways as make

00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,350
sense for your user to communicate with

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,390
you don't choose for your user how they

00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,830
have to communicate let them choose for

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,730
themselves how they're going to interact

00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:33,859
with you as with catherines you know

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,060
setup you've you know don't just provide

00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:37,400
a phone because there's going to be

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,030
someone who literally cannot do that if

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,890
you have some kind of booking you know

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,540
provide you know a text-based you know

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,950
interaction that will allow people to

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:51,080
book and let them call make sure that

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,810
your core functionality is front and

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,460
center there's no reason to bury your

00:38:53,810 --> 00:39:01,660
core functionality make it easy use

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,130
closed captions and this is you know

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,980
closed captions are great now not just

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,780
for people who need it because they

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,400
can't hear the content it's great

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,520
because if you're scrolling down you

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,780
know your social media feed I mean raise

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,190
your hand if you've been sucked into a

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,740
video you would have otherwise ignored

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:23,359
because you saw some closed caption text

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:27,830
yeah I've me too it's useful it's also

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,290
again good for SEO you don't need to put

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,030
in a ton of effort to closed caption you

00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,190
don't need to go and sit there typing

00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,230
this up all by yourself we showed this

00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,390
last year we have a blog post up on our

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,619
site that walks you through step by step

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:44,660
but YouTube has a freely available

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,400
automatic closed captioning system you

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,780
upload a video even if you upload it

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,560
privately

00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:54,710
YouTube's bots will go and analyze the

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,070
audio add the closed captions and it's

00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,710
crazy accurate all you have to do is

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,630
then watch it through once identify

00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,910
where it messed up and just change the

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,750
word and it's it's easy to do because if

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,190
adding all of the timings so you

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,020
have to go back and do that that was the

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,510
brutal part of closed captioning before

00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,790
this so anyone can do this there are

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,080
zero excuses for having videos without

00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,050
closed caption because you can then

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,000
export them back out and upload them

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:25,020
elsewhere you don't even need to keep it

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,650
on YouTube when you're displaying error

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,260
text don't just use color to indicate

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:33,090
that something is wrong you know because

00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,010
color is not going to be helpful for

00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,390
your color blind users and it's not

00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:39,360
going to be particularly useful for your

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,820
screen readers users it's also even if

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,190
you are sighted and you know and have

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,810
normal vision it's kind of a pain to

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,030
have to go through and find you know

00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,560
what's silly you know tiny symbol

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,080
someone dropped next to a field to

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:56,640
indicate to you that you screwed up make

00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:59,450
it clear use text use imagery the more

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,270
the more that you use the better

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,360
optimize around touch and keyboard and

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,700
mouse interactions if you are if you

00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,040
think that touch and mouse interactions

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,960
are the same thing come find me at the

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,960
phase 2 booth so I will happily educate

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:21,840
alt text your images and do it properly

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,280
really figure out why you put your that

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,080
image on the site in the first place

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,260
what was it that you intended to convey

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,100
if a blind user can hear your

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,570
description of the image and move on

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,700
having understood what a sighted user

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:40,280
would you have achieved your goal if

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,280
they cannot you've fallen short

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,480
you know setup you could use proper

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,700
semantic structures don't jump between

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:54,600
your ages and don't use don't use your

00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,340
ages specifically for styling I know

00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,660
that that is you know depending upon how

00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,840
you've set up your site that might

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:05,220
require a refactor in either technology

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,790
or how you are using it but this is an

00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,790
important thing

00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:14,040
Drupal 8 is a really great base to start

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,560
with if you're looking to build an

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,130
accessible site the way that handle skip

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,640
links forms alt text is now required

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,910
error message

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,559
doing all and SEO all of this is out of

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,500
the box you have a much stronger

00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,450
experience our whole talk last year was

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,920
on this so there's a video of that if

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:37,140
you are interested in more of the nuance

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,769
we also have an accessibility playbook

00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,240
that we put together this is a lot of

00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:44,549
the things we've talked about and some

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,420
more that can be used to help kick-start

00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:50,730
your team you can catherine has tweeted

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,609
this out she will be tweeting it out

00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,980
I'll be retweeting it but you can get

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:57,329
that from us and you know feel free to

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,769
reach out if you have follow-up

00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,150
questions on it so to wrap up when you

00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:04,470
are designing for accessibility you are

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,079
designing for the lowest common

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:11,309
denominator we're talking about in terms

00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,819
of senses and and mobility and use of

00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:17,910
use of their hands this means that you

00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:20,599
are trying to build something that is as

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:23,160
universal as you can possibly get it

00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,039
what I'm asking everyone to do here is

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,650
to fight for accessibility not just push

00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,930
suggest I mean you should absolutely be

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,640
fighting for it you should be fighting

00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,059
for it because it's the right thing to

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,009
do

00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:39,210
you disenfranchising users is you know

00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:42,900
not something that should be happening

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,240
at this point do it for because it's the

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,130
selfish thing to do do it because one

00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,990
day you're going to need it if you live

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,559
long enough you're going to reach a

00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:54,210
point where you are going to say man I

00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,339
really wish I fought harder for

00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,789
accessibility because the web sucks I

00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:01,890
can't see this I can't read this why is

00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:03,359
it this way and is the reason that it's

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,619
that you would be looking back and

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,990
saying that is because not enough people

00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,880
were fighting for it some other quick

00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,609
selfish reasons to do this is that it's

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,660
good for SEO that will boost your site

00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:17,910
it also opens you up to new new markets

00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,710
it opens up people who otherwise would

00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,730
not be able to purchase from you or take

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,589
in your content if you are doing a new

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,539
site build if you are looking out over

00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:29,880
the horizon and there is one coming make

00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:32,009
sure that accessibility is a core part

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,160
of your goals because it is far easier

00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:39,510
to build fresh excessively than it is

00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,270
you start from scratch on a then it is

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,980
bolted on it is absolutely doable its

00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,380
increment you know you have to focus on

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,880
incremental iteration and it is

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,220
important if you don't have a site

00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,630
redesign coming up to start figuring out

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,130
how you could make those incremental

00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,130
improvements but if you have a redesign

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,470
coming think about what you're going to

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,600
do to make sure that you are coming into

00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,130
compliance because you will you're you

00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:08,340
will thank yourself later on if you do

00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:11,580
it so last recap do this for yourself

00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,830
you're going to want this one day do it

00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:17,670
for your users because they are going to

00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:19,530
want it designed excessively for your

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,330
lawyer because they're going to love you

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,270
for it and you should love your lawyer

00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,790
they're looking out for you do you want

00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,740
for usability a site that is built with

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:32,940
it with good accessibility principles is

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:34,280
a usable site do it for SEO a site that

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,260
is built with good accessibility

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,260
practices is usually pretty search

00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:47,760
engine optimized do it because it's the

00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:49,950
right thing to do maybe five minutes I

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,290
think you have to give us a room but

00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,730
please if anybody has questions I think

00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:59,070
that to make it the middle of the room

00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:02,190
don't be shy oh really okay so I just

00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:04,320
wanted some clarification on alt text so

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,290
are there any guidelines as far as

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,170
assuming the gender or race or anything

00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,060
like that of the person or people in the

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,180
picture because I feel like that could

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,920
potentially be touchy and also just the

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,150
length of the alt text there with some

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,040
of the examples that you gave her a

00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:26,550
little bit longer than I've been guided

00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:28,590
to use in the past so in terms of race

00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:31,230
ethnicity and other other identifying

00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,780
characteristics my suggestion would be

00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,640
to think about again the context is it

00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,530
is the you know is the fact that the

00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,030
person a woman relevant you know if

00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,880
you're if you are building a site that

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:45,120
is encouraging girls to code absolutely

00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,710
it is completely relevant if you are if

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,810
your site is pushing the pharmaceutical

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:52,380
product that is gender neutral

00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:54,360
maybe not in terms of length we

00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:58,320
recommend shooting for the length of you

00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,210
know of a tweet and use the length that

00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,860
met that makes the most sense to conveys

00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,990
a meaning that you need to convey if

00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,200
you're if you've got 500 characters

00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,800
you're too long if you paid 100 110

00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,600
you're fine

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:14,250
the key is to make sure that you're

00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:16,500
conveying the meaning yeah can you speak

00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,870
to some of the newer technologies like

00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,910
angularjs and accessibility or basically

00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,710
things where you're using javascript to

00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:27,990
draw the screen and how screen readers

00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:30,870
handle that is technical hey I thought

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,760
I'm not super familiar with that we've

00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:36,210
got some great exposure to view we've

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,810
got to my right next to you my dear yeah

00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:42,930
so there's a lot of accessibility in

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:45,420
JavaScript that is improving

00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:47,580
it's definitely be walk upon and I've

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,660
seen some JavaScript implement an

00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:53,550
angular even go ahead in it that the

00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,670
screen readers work on the Dom so you

00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:59,100
can build a nice framework with

00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,320
JavaScript that that is accessible but

00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,090
but it comes down to if the community

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,370
has enough people and if the if there's

00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:07,290
enough motivation to go up and see that

00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,810
the central library is being maintained

00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:12,360
and tested for accessibility and I'm not

00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:14,010
I've heard some mixed results and so it

00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,380
really depends on the library and

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:20,820
checking to see how out how viable that

00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:23,720
is so yeah thank you thank you Chris oh

00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,730
it's a suggestion if you're going to

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,850
tell people to use YouTube's automated

00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,580
capturing tell them to make sure that

00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,500
they go through and correct the captions

00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,230
yes because they are me yeah the

00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,030
automated captioning is yeah it doesn't

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,560
work in most conditions

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,960
yeah definitely that's definitely

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,850
something that we do we do the automatic

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,160
transcription they be good to be doing

00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:49,680
manually I did this talk last year

00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,560
YouTube understand David perfectly

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,110
didn't understand me I hurt my feelings

00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,960
but that's all right so I had to go in

00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,430
need change get my talk so I definitely

00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,990
understand you agree

00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,940
go ahead well

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,440
the conversation of off of what you just

00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,850
said if you work in the public sector

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,180
you're actually required to have

00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:12,730
broadcast quality captioning nice

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,290
so just for any other public sector

00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,630
folks in the room I thought I would

00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,000
share that yeah and then for color

00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,770
contrast I actually really like the

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,230
posse yellow groups color contrast

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,660
analyzer because not only does it check

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,750
for different forms of colorblindness or

00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:31,390
cataracts but also lets you select it

00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,860
give you color options for your palette

00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,390
so it's actually a really strong tool

00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,880
that's good yeah things with that's a

00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,340
totally non trust analyzer is by the

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,890
posse yellow group who works with wc3

00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:44,170
