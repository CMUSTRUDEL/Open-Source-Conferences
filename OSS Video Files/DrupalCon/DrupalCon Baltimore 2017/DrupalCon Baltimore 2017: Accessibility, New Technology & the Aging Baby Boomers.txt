Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Accessibility isnâ€™t just for the blind or deaf. Accessibility is for everyone. Our eyes, ears, and motor function wonâ€™t get better with age.

Accessible design improves usability for everyone, and it increases SEO and market size for every website, and that matters more now than ever. With a technologically competent and aging Baby Boomer population, we are expecting previously unseen numbers of users who will demand accessible experiences, and weâ€™re here to help you understand how to create them.

Takeaways:

An updated understanding of what accessibility is and whom it is for
Experience websites through a screen-reader on a non-compliant, as well as a compliant website.
Walk through a time and budget-saving method for creating closed captions.
Learn about the long-term benefits of accessible design to improve web experiences for all users
Gain insight into the great opportunities and requirements for voice control
Articulate the upcoming / new Section 508 Refresh and how it may impact your work.

mentioned I'm Katherine I lost my

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,449
hearing to meditators when I was 8

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,520
months old and I was one of the first

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,579
recipients of the cochlear implant which

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,190
is a a technological implantable device

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,890
so I've been a technology pioneer my

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,180
whole life so it's been really cool so

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,270
I've grown up enough with their

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,760
computers and I'm really excited to talk

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,790
about how meeting Navis technology to

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,840
grid communities and equal the playing

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,790
field for everybody David hi I'm David

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,920
Spira my background and accessibility

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,460
started when I was 16 years old when I

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,900
volunteered to build a computer lab at

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,590
the retirement home and teach the people

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,360
living there how to use them and got a

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,650
immediate and startling crash course on

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,009
accessibility we both work for phase 2

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,399
where a were a digital agency we design

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,040
develop and do a whole bunch of awesome

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,630
things for various web properties we're

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,220
hiring we have a really interesting

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,340
booth downstairs so you should

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,219
definitely come check it out

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,670
dive on in the elderly are going to

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,680
outnumber those under the age of 5 by

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,240
2020 this is the thing that hasn't

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,009
happened before in history so while they

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,379
aren't making new new ones the baby

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,000
boomers are the largest you know the

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,390
largest segment and the elderly or the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
fast

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,100
growing segments in America at the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,140
moment and this is happening throughout

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,930
the Western world they make up 15% of

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,200
the population and this is a group that

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,090
you cannot afford to ignore because 68

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,740
percent of baby boomers and please folks

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,709
come on in there's plenty of seating up

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,130
front if you want 68 percent of baby

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,190
boomers have multiple devices these are

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:45,030
folks over the age of 55 and you know

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,770
they're used to using them as they start

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,550
to age they are not like their parents

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,830
generation who generally didn't care

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,930
about use of technology these are people

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,190
who are expecting to use technology

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,680
until they're gone so don't treat them

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,230
like you but you know from a web design

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,480
standpoint like the previous elderly

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,400
generation who genuinely didn't care so

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,410
on top of that you have this group of

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,950
one in five Americans who have a

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,420
disability now this map that you're

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,769
seeing here doesn't mean much for

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,290
accessibility but just to give you a

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,250
frame of reference this is each state

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,870
redrawn according to its population and

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,400
if we were to go and take a look at the

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,320
population of people in America with

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,440
disabilities it's seven times the

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,610
population of the state of New York so

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,030
this is a large amount of people one in

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,680
five Americans sort of one in five

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,420
Americans have a disability and half of

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,160
them need some kind of assistance

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,440
navigating a website so that's ten

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,440
percent of the population essentially

00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,630
are these is this do you want to ignore

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,140
ten percent of the population and then

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:06,480
on top of that you have temporary

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,019
disabilities friend of mine went

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,380
snowboarding had a very interesting fall

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,729
and left the hospital with both of his

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,950
hands and casts these things happen

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,890
people have strokes people encounter all

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,650
sorts of unexpected ailments that change

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,190
the way that they see and into here and

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,460
interact

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,830
with the world so this is not just for

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,780
some nice group of people we're talking

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,270
when we talk about accessibility we're

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,650
talking about everybody we're talking

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,360
about the elderly we're talking about

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,070
people who have the disability to

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,250
commonly associate with accessibility

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,410
and we're talking about people who are

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,600
living functional lives without any

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,650
impairments who suddenly find themselves

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,280
in need of accessibility this is truly

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,110
for everyone so let's talk a little bit

00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,670
about color blindness and if you've ever

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,790
attended one of our talks one of the

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,890
things that we really focus on is

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,140
reframing disability and helping people

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,800
find you know find an empathic

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,700
connection to these problems so color

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,300
blindness affects half a percent of

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,010
women it's a color blindness its genetic

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,510
but it affects approximately 8% of men

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,260
so that's an important thing to note if

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,140
you operate a website that is targeting

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,890
men you're talking about 8% of your

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,419
audience is colorblind McCullough's

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,030
colorblind the simulator is the thing

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,830
I'm a really big fan of because what it

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,730
does is it allows you to upload images

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,020
and then simulate most of the different

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,600
types of colorblindness that are out

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,240
there and see what your designs look

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,210
like through the eyes of someone else

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,560
literally so on the left you're going to

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,370
see a normal image on the right you're

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,770
going to see a different type of

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,090
colorblindness it's worth noting there

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:06,000
are lots of different types of

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:10,770
colorblindness so red week this is what

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,240
red blind looks like blue blind and then

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,320
black and white which is the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,730
stereotypical but incredibly rare

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,070
colorblindness but most people I think

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,600
think of when they're when people talk

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,850
about colorblindness this isn't actually

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,850
a very common form of it see if

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,290
it's going okay so this is the code

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,670
let's color blind the simulator so you

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,970
can just upload an image this is

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,010
humanitarian ID and app that I worked on

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,470
for about a year and this is what it's

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,030
looking like through the eye through

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,420
different types of color blindness you

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,180
can very quickly easily and for

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,100
absolutely no money upload screenshots

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,730
of your designs of your existing

00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,520
websites and run them through and see

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,600
what they look like for different types

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,060
of colorblindness and what you're

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,740
looking for is not this you know mystic

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,450
like perfect brand experience for

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,490
further colorblind you're not going to

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,860
achieve that what you are looking for is

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,720
making sure that you can actually read

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,370
and see everything that's relevant on

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,770
the page the great thing about

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,800
technology is that it can enable

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,200
independent living people who have a

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,720
wheelchair or who are blind or who have

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,310
here lost to new technology to get where

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,430
they need if you think about someone

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,770
who's blind they can use Alexa at home

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,020
to call uber without having to rely on

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,230
somebody else to drive them somewhere so

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,350
they can never technology to advance the

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,120
to make their lives easier one thing

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,190
that I just kind of my talk about a very

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,850
I might experience when thinking about

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,950
your website in Hoonah serving in future

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,650
audience in thinking about that you

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,480
would be amazed at what kinds of sites

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,480
are encounter and the customer service

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,790
that I experience I just want to talk to

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,870
you about um the experience I had a year

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,760
ago when my cochlear implants broke and

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,640
let me tell you when they break I can't

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,890
hear a thing I can't come to work I

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,410
can't talk to my family I can't talk to

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,710
my friends I can't hear them so it's a

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,870
very distressing experience so I have a

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,850
lot of turning map of what was going on

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,070
with my processors football program I

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,680
was you know really low emotion of

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,169
things that she'd I can't function I

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,030

website the hey the different access

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,409
form good but I can't call them so I was

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,500
able to go on the website

response was give me a call

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:16,170

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,050
of bummer and out really negatively

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,910
impacted me as a person and made me feel

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,089
like I still needed somebody to help me

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,089
I couldn't be this alone I can adult by

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,959
myself so but not let's look at the

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:45,339
ideal experience and what the ultimate

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,500
experience Kurt have been so as you can

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:52,689
see my purchase is broken and I'm

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:56,560
waiting I'm anxious so and the response

00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:58,779
I get is hey so I is broken fear is

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,259
there four ways that you can contact us

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:05,019

immediately replacement ASAP usually

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,439
they open a database and in the

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,639
meanwhile I still need to go to my

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:20,290
clinic to literally get my hearing

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,540
reprogrammed they put me up to a

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,089
computer and then I get a new program

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,720
from a processors so I had to go to my

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,579
audiologist website remember I can't

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,860
hear anything

00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:36,399
thankfully turns Hopkins who's just down

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,319
the road said hey use our online booking

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,360
calendar to book an appointment with a

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,250
doctor and there was great because I can

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,069
see all the available times that my

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,490
doctor to see me as well as mine so that

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:51,069
create a much more hominid experience

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,790
and the great thing was fading call me

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:57,460
to confirm they confirmed me in the same

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,700
when I reached out to them by text means

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,920
so they texted me the hain appointments

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,180
been confirmed or seen on Thursday that

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,600
was good because they didn't call me

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,550
which would have gone unanswered so and

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,860
you know in the great thing is my doctor

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,680
saw me initially sent me a follow-up

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,110
email to say hey hope is rocky are great

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,360
so this is a really important experience

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,100
we need to think about our audience who

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,470
know surveying and think about the

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,350
response and how only receiving that

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,840
audience are you able to access them are

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,570
you able to give them the means to get

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,060
in touch with you and I'm so really

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,390
money talking about our like teacher

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,420
feeding your digital experience what all

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,150
those are temporarily disabling

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,190
conditions are they going to be able to

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,290
do to say if they don't know how to do

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,650
describe either where they don't go the

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,350
keyboard shortcuts all those clipped

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,930
itÃ­s easy to bind is it easy to

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,670
understand the web experience thinking

00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,230
about those experiences because not

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,460
everybody's didn't know how to need to

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:06,460
scream either right off the bat now I've

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,250
kind of want to go through some some

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:13,480
experiences that emulate what is play

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,820
for somebody you can't see a skiing and

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,250
so we're gonna I'm going through a quick

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,830
exercise I'm going to be playing an

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,650
audio description of an image and I want

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:37,680
you to try to visualize what that image

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:37,680
is so image man washing hands oh dear

00:12:40,350 --> 00:13:16,240
image man washing ham image image man

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:17,920
Washington all right come to mind

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,990
really think about ready here man wash

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,680
your hands think it'd be a lot of

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,640
different images light did it look

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,589
something like this

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,720
I doubt it she thought of a certain

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,870
washing his hands let me see your hands

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,890
I didn't think so now let's talk about

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,959
writing a good or text description now

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,620
one thing I love to do is think about

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:48,339
our text like a tweet sure to sink into

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,730
the point now in that image I decide to

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,899
how about Sunday late your doctor in

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:59,829
scrubs sort of a cap in masks works on

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,760
as others up treat others with soap to

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,730
prepare for surgery

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,490
the swore descriptive the man wash your

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,000
hands mean to say good I'm going to

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,579
agree so consider think about while

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,029
without image chosen what was the

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,130
context of that image why did someone on

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,990
the content marketing team play there is

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,920
an important image what does it

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,750
communicate what is it in bay and so

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,029
we're going to be ready to emotional

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,880
context of this and you appearing

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:36,130
website d1 and so you know hospital

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:41,649
patients that you care in hygienic so

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,470
we've got describes sociopath in mask so

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,870
surgical cap indicates day that appear

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,209
it's not very baseball cap window

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,140
surgery so it's important to say is a

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,940
surgical cap looks on me needs observant

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,790
either work you know he's ready to

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,390
prepare for surgery now there's up this

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:04,029
open elbows meaning that is hygienic

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:07,060
another important thing in preparation

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,829
for surgery in the case purpose so these

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,570
are very important quality you have an

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,820
image that you want to be able to

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,339
communicate or due to the screen reader

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,640
it means not just for screen readers is

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:23,740
creep SEO cynically beginning these on

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,200
the Harper Box a suit now let's do an

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,860
exercise together

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:33,160
miss write or text together so now the

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:37,029
context of this is a Red Cross Disaster

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,640

yeah

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,020
and you might need more time

00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm gonna start video some of the

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,710

we've got American Red Cross aid worker

00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:31,059
hiking devastated woman surrounded by

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:33,369
home wreckers under this guy that's very

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,159
good that indicates the disaster that

00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,720
happened in digital recovery process

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,840
they did we build in person so that's

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,220
that's definitely good description

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,889
Romanian breeze we leave Brooklyn with a

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,860

good far into a height flooding victim

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,320
ah could be a little bit more

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:56,789
descriptive because if the blood still

00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,409
going on you know we can't place help

00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,409
and then let's see where else is there

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:08,649
anybody else - like chiming from the

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,749

if you want to say if you have any other

00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:16,590
suggestions but I think the is really

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,269
about context and the context matters

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,039
thanks for participating there in the

00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,899

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:54,309
context of that or text links is another

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,470
another thing that is very challenging

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:03,519
and often times mission context a lot of

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:06,879
times we see links there are more clip

00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,769
here contact us but it doesn't have the

00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,620
context that we need to understand what

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:12,980
the link is

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:17,530
what it means so how many of you have

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,570
ever heard a screen reader before oh

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,490
that's a good number of you so I'm going

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,770
to play a series of videos that

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,610
immolates with a screen reader is saying

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,100
and again they just not be one-to-one

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,000
experience of somebody who just be

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:46,610
reader they may have the own shortcuts

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:49,280
so yeah blank blank blank blank blank

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,120
you are currently on a link to a blank

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,910
image sling hi did you know were to

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,870
click on did you know when you clicked

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:22,130
on one more little no way that so there

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,740
is better way to do it

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,690
Newton you can actually make the links

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:32,809
mobile event you can add hidden element

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,110
that is vv to compact upon like the blog

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,720
title so is actually as a

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,450
compromise so as you can see on this

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,070
website it still says more but the

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,350
screen readers didn't give a more

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:52,910
context so hopefully I can get this

keyboard user may not always know if

00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:30,019
so one of six is helpful so I can see I

00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:32,260
will not go over one of six to its 6:50

00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,760
that helps them understand

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:43,540

thankfully all our digital Teva ball if

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,690
you know what our standards are and you

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,490
can actually implement them in tuner

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,640
website to make it easier for everybody

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:23,740
HT be a for mobile tablet as you be

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,400
deeper down the road when we start to

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,350
implement the police

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,570
automated technology state theory in

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,990
echo and a lot of really exciting stuff

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,240
so Willie where do you begin

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,750
not here though don't worry about it

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,320
it's okay just take a deep breath

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:47,770
because it is not as overwhelming as it

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,950
may seem really to take a step back and

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:54,220
think about a site identify the main

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,860
purpose of a site what only doing for

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,540
the audience and start there don't think

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,030
about every single thing they need to be

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,810
built right now is you save ecommerce

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:07,030
site if you can ecommerce site make sure

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:10,560
that the South the experience for

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:14,950
somebody users be read or keyboard is on

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,220
track the forms accessible they aren't

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,930
accessible in one of those touch points

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,020
more even use you're going to be doing

00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,640
in order to purchase those items they

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,180
could be building the builds are going

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,890
to be selecting a shopping cart and and

00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,650
then consider those accessibility

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,020
elements building you should understand

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,830
the build in the label the leadership

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,810
what they understand how do you check

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,620
out what they understand where to put a

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,850
credit card information and think about

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,530
those interactions

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,410
and how can you achieve those

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,740
accessibility purposes in them from

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:57,250
there what is it going to look like when

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,340
you have 10% increase in accessibility

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:03,070
by saying are we looking at 10% increase

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,800
revenue are we looking at 10% increased

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,020
memberships the opportunities are really

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,060
there for you to be able to make a

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,030
business case to talk with the platter

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,280
teams to talk with somebody who is in

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,640
terms of the spending for the site as a

00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,560
look me happy up to opportunity to

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,070
increase our revenue by making this

00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:27,400
accessible so that is a bottom line idea

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,400
and so boom there really is categorizing

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,470
by the interaction okay immunities are

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,630
not accessible okay what do we need to

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,930
do about it you just kind of go from

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,990
there and track them please is possible

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:44,710
for this the content editor is

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,230
responsible for quality or text the

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,410
developer is responsible for making sure

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,560
that the build is there for the content

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,960
editor to Berlin now in people 8 the alt

00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,840
text field is required by the box so

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,030
that didn't care for us in Drupal but we

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,070
need them I think that you see faster

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,920
before work so that we can communicate

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:09,130
in the backlog in prioritized we need to

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,620
happen in so from there you've done

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:18,370
audit in about prioritizing what are the

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,650
must-haves element who matched one must

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,720
be back to the tablet apart in order to

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,300
improve the experience and those really

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,850
focus on first and then once you've done

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,980
that leaving take a step back there okay

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,320
now we've done that we've released it

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,260
none our customers can purchase things

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,780
now Stage two is kind of making sure

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,300
that they're up to compliance where

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,940
there are not no part of our federal

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,120
funding site how many of you are

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,670
familiar with section 508 but they're

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,490
painful how about web content

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,830
accessibility guidelines very good about

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,980
equal number how many of you know that

00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,630
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,620
are now the new

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,480
to be stained of a second by the way

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,720
that's pretty cool so it's really

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,620
exciting so literally test of G weeks

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,200
ago the access board said hey Section

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,230
five away after ten years is finally

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,160
being updated section battery was when

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:25,429
in 1988 and this is way before modern

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,309
web technologies happened so the web

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:31,760
content accessibility guidelines is made

00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,470
of thought leaders who are the hey these

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,510
are the best practices that we should be

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,570
doing for the website today and they

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,640
kind of cut things up to be so P becomes

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,100
plain going to retire for best practices

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,289
section by the way in the meanwhile kind

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,070
of became updated really still the

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:51,860
federal standard but now the second

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,850
batteries kind of say look we recognized

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,130
for our days so let's look at web 2.0 I

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,950
thought would be the new standard and

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:06,530
that actually meant to give back most

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:09,679
22nd and by January January 18th 2018

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,350
better site must be in conformance with

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,020
the tag two point of Louisville a and

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,210
double-a so it's a lot of a lot of

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,400
really exciting stuff the actors on the

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,940
accessibility firm because we have being

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,370
these websites up to relevant in

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,880
accessibility in the modern technologies

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:32,320
not just the outdated levels and so it's

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,190
a great but a great opportunity and so

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:41,090
yeah okay so I want to talk about some

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,880
tools that can help you along the first

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,200
one is a I don't actually know how they

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,450
pronounce it whether it's totally or

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,059
towed to a lie either way it's a great

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,309
tool what this is is it was made by the

00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:55,460
Khan Academy and it is both a Chrome

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:59,080
extension and a Drupal module and it

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,659
basically is like accessibility vision

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,100
when you use it when you turn it on you

00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:07,179
get this little menu on the left side

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,980
that gives you a number of different

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:12,740
ways to scan the site for accessibility

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,280
now this is not perfect this is not you

00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,610
know if you need

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,200
to do a proper accessibility audit you

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,400
know this is not really going to help

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,870
you you're going to need to bring

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
someone on who actually knows what

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,890
they're doing and that's the thing we

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,760
can help you out with but if you are

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:31,280
looking for spot checks of content spot

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,440
checks of your site this is great it'll

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,430
allow you to view the alt text it will

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,950
allow you to you know check color

00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,230
contrast it just starts to overlay it

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,300
bear in mind that this has been there

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,340
they've been iterating on this it is a

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,900
little bit quirky at times like right

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,600
now you'll notice in the middle that it

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,510
is reading the background the contrast

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,800
on that button against the background

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,660
color not against the of the site that

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,960
blue area not against the white button

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,850
background color so it can be fooled but

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,340
you can take a look at the notes that it

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,660
brings up and you'll be able to identify

00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,810
that it just doesn't know what it's

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,600
talking about but that's just those are

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,820
few and far between

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,410
you know it's also useful for spotting

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,280
when you're not using proper semantic

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,840
structure it's useful for reading your

00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,520
site back to your sections of your site

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,100
back to you as a screen reader would

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,960
this is great because as you heard

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,390
before many many many websites torture

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,030
people who use screen readers so this is

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,920
a great way for you to do quick spot

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,570
checks and make sure that a screen

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:48,710
reader user won't hate you another tool

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,020
is ckeditor which is baked into Drupal 8

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,090
it is currently not enabled because

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,950
there are some security issues that

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,020
still need to be ironed out if anyone is

00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,140
in the room who could have an effect on

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,760
that you know maybe bump that up the

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,690
backlog but ckeditor is is

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,120
mind-bogglingly useful because as a

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:13,760
designer for accessibility and and

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,680
someone and our developers who handle

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,050
who handle it we can design and build

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,990
for accessibility and then it is

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,160
entirely upon the content manager to

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,930
actually see this through

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,610
so the sites that is perfectly designed

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,750
for accessibility and perfectly built

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,270
for accessibility

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,550
will completely collapse if you don't

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,730
have a content content management team

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,830
that is on top of it every single day

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,660
with every single word that they drop on

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,420
the site with every single image that

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:46,610
they put on the site ckeditor can really

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:50,140
truly help do this by putting in in

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,450
browser you know in WYSIWYG tools to

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,570
scan this this is so you hit a button it

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,990
brings up this and right now the first

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,940
thing that is spotted is that this image

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,400
doesn't have an alt text you'll notice

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,170
that it's got a quick fixed field right

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,780
in the middle of you know right right

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,000
there you can type in your alt text hit

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,200
quick fix and it will apply it you don't

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,100
have to go back and make any changes

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,620
it's literally there for you the next

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,630
one this is a having a hard time seeing

00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,930
on that angle this one is identifying

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:28,580
paragraphs module is being used to drop

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:30,770
headers instead of an h1 h2 h3 so that's

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,810
going to baffle a screen reader that is

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,390
trying to skim the site and provide an

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,280
overview you can do a quick fix right

00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:39,350
there it's giving you a drop-down asking

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,360
you which H you want you select the one

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:46,100
you want quick fix done the next one is

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,160
have noticed this is my favorite it

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,830
noticed that the editor didn't use you

00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,170
know proper markup to insert numbers

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:56,330
they they typed them in and it's just

00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,850
flashing it said hey fix this delete

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:02,000
those numbers lasso at all and then just

00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,560
hit hit hit numbers and it's fixed that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,400
one there is no quick fix because it's a

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,010
little bit more nuanced the next one

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,080
this is noticing that there was not from

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,770
proper semantic structure used someone

00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,930
jumped from an h1 to h3 skipping h2 it's

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:21,800
telling you what to do provides a quick

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:23,870
fix done and then this last one is

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,560
noticing this is my second favorite that

00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,600
the content editor has copied and pasted

00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,940
the image name into the alt text field

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,800
which is awful it is worse than having

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,140
no alt text because now a screen reader

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,000
is getting some you know screen reader

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,030
users getting some gibberish that

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,220
provides no context to them

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,160
quick fix again type in your alt text

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,720
and you're all good and then the last

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,150
one is tables oh yes tables this one is

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,830
noticing that the tables don't have

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,200
proper headings it allows you to select

00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,760
whether you want horizontal or vertical

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:05,150
quick fix done and last but not least we

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,530
have another adjacent links this one's

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,780
really cool

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,700
it picked up that there are two links

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,800
beside one another that are pointing at

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,930
the same place so a screen reader user

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,170
would end up hearing that URL twice in

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,350
this case if you hit quick fix it will

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:25,750
just merge those hyperlinks together so

00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:29,360
it removes the redundancy which is great

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,770
so again when you are auditing your site

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,240
when you're reviewing your site if

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,000
Katherine is saying what you want to be

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,920
doing is prioritizing you have to figure

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,110
out what makes your software what makes

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,260
your website important why are people

00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,170
going to it and focus your accessibility

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,940
efforts on that because accessibility as

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,640
we said in our talk last year it's a

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,760
journey not a destination you are not

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,920
going to achieve some level you know

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,420
some imaginary perfect accessibility

00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,330
that you never have to focus on it again

00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,310
but you should always keep in mind your

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,570
core functionality your core goals and

00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:07,550
your users core goals you know

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,610
prioritize what you need to make your

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,500
experience work that's stage one the

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,850
next is figuring out where you need what

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,530
you need to achieve from a regulatory

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,770
standpoint and if you don't have a

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,410
regulatory standing that you need to

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,600
achieve it's good to know what status

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,870
you're striving for you know single a

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,890
double a triple a because if you're

00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,180
really putting the effort into

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,000
accessibility you should make sure that

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,070
your user base is aware of it if you do

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,070
all of this and nobody knows it then

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,480
you've also kind of failed and then the

00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,710
last is figuring out where you're going

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,420
to iterate and again you should be

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,670
looking towards your core functionality

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,020
to figure out where it makes most sense

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,020
for you to put the effort in

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,859
you know focus on this and do it start

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,420
now if you haven't already because

00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,330
it's a long road and it's but it's a

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,510
road worth walking you need to do this

00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:04,790
you know for your users make sure that

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,240
they know that you actually you really

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:10,300
truly care about their experience about

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,160
their ability to access your information

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,510
in order to show this you want to make

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,780
sure that you're doing things like

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,609
providing tons of waves as many ways as

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,440
you possibly can in as many ways as make

00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,350
sense for your user to communicate with

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,390
you don't choose for your user how they

00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,830
have to communicate let them choose for

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,730
themselves how they're going to interact

00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:33,859
with you as with catherines you know

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,060
setup you've you know don't just provide

00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:37,400
a phone because there's going to be

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,030
someone who literally cannot do that if

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,890
you have some kind of booking you know

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,540
provide you know a text-based you know

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,950
interaction that will allow people to

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:51,080
book and let them call make sure that

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,810
your core functionality is front and

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,460
center there's no reason to bury your

00:38:53,810 --> 00:39:01,660
core functionality make it easy use

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,130
closed captions and this is you know

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,980
closed captions are great now not just

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,780
for people who need it because they

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,400
can't hear the content it's great

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,520
because if you're scrolling down you

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,780
know your social media feed I mean raise

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,190
your hand if you've been sucked into a

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,740
video you would have otherwise ignored

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:23,359
because you saw some closed caption text

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:27,830
yeah I've me too it's useful it's also

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,290
again good for SEO you don't need to put

00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,030
in a ton of effort to closed caption you

00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,190
don't need to go and sit there typing

00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,230
this up all by yourself we showed this

00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,390
last year we have a blog post up on our

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,619
site that walks you through step by step

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:44,660
but YouTube has a freely available

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,400
automatic closed captioning system you

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,780
upload a video even if you upload it

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,560
privately

00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:54,710
YouTube's bots will go and analyze the

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,070
audio add the closed captions and it's

00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,710
crazy accurate all you have to do is

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,630
then watch it through once identify

00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,910
where it messed up and just change the

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,750
word and it's it's easy to do because if

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,190
adding all of the timings so you

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,020
have to go back and do that that was the

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,510
brutal part of closed captioning before

00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,790
this so anyone can do this there are

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,080
zero excuses for having videos without

00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,050
closed caption because you can then

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,000
export them back out and upload them

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:25,020
elsewhere you don't even need to keep it

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,650
on YouTube when you're displaying error

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,260
text don't just use color to indicate

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:33,090
that something is wrong you know because

00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,010
color is not going to be helpful for

00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,390
your color blind users and it's not

00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:39,360
going to be particularly useful for your

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,820
screen readers users it's also even if

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,190
you are sighted and you know and have

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,810
normal vision it's kind of a pain to

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,030
have to go through and find you know

00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,560
what's silly you know tiny symbol

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,080
someone dropped next to a field to

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:56,640
indicate to you that you screwed up make

00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:59,450
it clear use text use imagery the more

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,270
the more that you use the better

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,360
optimize around touch and keyboard and

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,700
mouse interactions if you are if you

00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,040
think that touch and mouse interactions

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,960
are the same thing come find me at the

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,960
phase 2 booth so I will happily educate

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:21,840
alt text your images and do it properly

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,280
really figure out why you put your that

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,080
image on the site in the first place

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,260
what was it that you intended to convey

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,100
if a blind user can hear your

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,570
description of the image and move on

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,700
having understood what a sighted user

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:40,280
would you have achieved your goal if

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,280
they cannot you've fallen short

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,480
you know setup you could use proper

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,700
semantic structures don't jump between

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:54,600
your ages and don't use don't use your

00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,340
ages specifically for styling I know

00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,660
that that is you know depending upon how

00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,840
you've set up your site that might

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:05,220
require a refactor in either technology

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,790
or how you are using it but this is an

00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,790
important thing

00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:14,040
Drupal 8 is a really great base to start

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,560
with if you're looking to build an

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,130
accessible site the way that handle skip

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,640
links forms alt text is now required

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,910
error message

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,559
doing all and SEO all of this is out of

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,500
the box you have a much stronger

00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,450
experience our whole talk last year was

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,920
on this so there's a video of that if

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:37,140
you are interested in more of the nuance

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,769
we also have an accessibility playbook

00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,240
that we put together this is a lot of

00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:44,549
the things we've talked about and some

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,420
more that can be used to help kick-start

00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:50,730
your team you can catherine has tweeted

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,609
this out she will be tweeting it out

00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,980
I'll be retweeting it but you can get

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:57,329
that from us and you know feel free to

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,769
reach out if you have follow-up

00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,150
questions on it so to wrap up when you

00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:04,470
are designing for accessibility you are

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,079
designing for the lowest common

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:11,309
denominator we're talking about in terms

00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,819
of senses and and mobility and use of

00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:17,910
use of their hands this means that you

00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:20,599
are trying to build something that is as

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:23,160
universal as you can possibly get it

00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,039
what I'm asking everyone to do here is

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,650
to fight for accessibility not just push

00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,930
suggest I mean you should absolutely be

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,640
fighting for it you should be fighting

00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,059
for it because it's the right thing to

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,009
do

00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:39,210
you disenfranchising users is you know

00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:42,900
not something that should be happening

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,240
at this point do it for because it's the

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,130
selfish thing to do do it because one

00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,990
day you're going to need it if you live

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,559
long enough you're going to reach a

00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:54,210
point where you are going to say man I

00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,339
really wish I fought harder for

00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,789
accessibility because the web sucks I

00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:01,890
can't see this I can't read this why is

00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:03,359
it this way and is the reason that it's

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,619
that you would be looking back and

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,990
saying that is because not enough people

00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,880
were fighting for it some other quick

00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,609
selfish reasons to do this is that it's

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,660
good for SEO that will boost your site

00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:17,910
it also opens you up to new new markets

00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,710
it opens up people who otherwise would

00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,730
not be able to purchase from you or take

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,589
in your content if you are doing a new

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,539
site build if you are looking out over

00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:29,880
the horizon and there is one coming make

00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:32,009
sure that accessibility is a core part

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,160
of your goals because it is far easier

00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:39,510
to build fresh excessively than it is

00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,270
you start from scratch on a then it is

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,980
bolted on it is absolutely doable its

00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,380
increment you know you have to focus on

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,880
incremental iteration and it is

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,220
important if you don't have a site

00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,630
redesign coming up to start figuring out

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,130
how you could make those incremental

00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,130
improvements but if you have a redesign

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,470
coming think about what you're going to

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,600
do to make sure that you are coming into

00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,130
compliance because you will you're you

00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:08,340
will thank yourself later on if you do

00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:11,580
it so last recap do this for yourself

00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,830
you're going to want this one day do it

00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:17,670
for your users because they are going to

00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:19,530
want it designed excessively for your

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,330
lawyer because they're going to love you

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,270
for it and you should love your lawyer

00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,790
they're looking out for you do you want

00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,740
for usability a site that is built with

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:32,940
it with good accessibility principles is

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:34,280
a usable site do it for SEO a site that

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,260
is built with good accessibility

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,260
practices is usually pretty search

00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:47,760
engine optimized do it because it's the

00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:49,950
right thing to do maybe five minutes I

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,290
think you have to give us a room but

00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,730
please if anybody has questions I think

00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:59,070
that to make it the middle of the room

00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:02,190
don't be shy oh really okay so I just

00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:04,320
wanted some clarification on alt text so

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,290
are there any guidelines as far as

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,170
assuming the gender or race or anything

00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,060
like that of the person or people in the

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,180
picture because I feel like that could

00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,920
potentially be touchy and also just the

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,150
length of the alt text there with some

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,040
of the examples that you gave her a

00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:26,550
little bit longer than I've been guided

00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:28,590
to use in the past so in terms of race

00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:31,230
ethnicity and other other identifying

00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,780
characteristics my suggestion would be

00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,640
to think about again the context is it

00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,530
is the you know is the fact that the

00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,030
person a woman relevant you know if

00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,880
you're if you are building a site that

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:45,120
is encouraging girls to code absolutely

00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,710
it is completely relevant if you are if

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,810
your site is pushing the pharmaceutical

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:52,380
product that is gender neutral

00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:54,360
maybe not in terms of length we

00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:58,320
recommend shooting for the length of you

00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,210
know of a tweet and use the length that

00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,860
met that makes the most sense to conveys

00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,990
a meaning that you need to convey if

00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,200
you're if you've got 500 characters

00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,800
you're too long if you paid 100 110

00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,600
you're fine

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:14,250
the key is to make sure that you're

00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:16,500
conveying the meaning yeah can you speak

00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,870
to some of the newer technologies like

00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,910
angularjs and accessibility or basically

00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,710
things where you're using javascript to

00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:27,990
draw the screen and how screen readers

00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:30,870
handle that is technical hey I thought

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,760
I'm not super familiar with that we've

00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:36,210
got some great exposure to view we've

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,810
got to my right next to you my dear yeah

00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:42,930
so there's a lot of accessibility in

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:45,420
JavaScript that is improving

00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:47,580
it's definitely be walk upon and I've

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,660
seen some JavaScript implement an

00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:53,550
angular even go ahead in it that the

00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,670
screen readers work on the Dom so you

00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:59,100
can build a nice framework with

00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,320
JavaScript that that is accessible but

00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,090
but it comes down to if the community

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,370
has enough people and if the if there's

00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:07,290
enough motivation to go up and see that

00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,810
the central library is being maintained

00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:12,360
and tested for accessibility and I'm not

00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:14,010
I've heard some mixed results and so it

00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,380
really depends on the library and

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:20,820
checking to see how out how viable that

00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:23,720
is so yeah thank you thank you Chris oh

00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,730
it's a suggestion if you're going to

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,850
tell people to use YouTube's automated

00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,580
capturing tell them to make sure that

00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,500
they go through and correct the captions

00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,230
yes because they are me yeah the

00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,030
automated captioning is yeah it doesn't

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,560
work in most conditions

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,960
yeah definitely that's definitely

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,850
something that we do we do the automatic

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,160
transcription they be good to be doing

00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:49,680
manually I did this talk last year

00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,560
YouTube understand David perfectly

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,110
didn't understand me I hurt my feelings

00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,960
but that's all right so I had to go in

00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,430
need change get my talk so I definitely

00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,990
understand you agree

00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,940
go ahead well

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,440
the conversation of off of what you just

00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,850
said if you work in the public sector

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,180
you're actually required to have

00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:12,730
broadcast quality captioning nice

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,290
so just for any other public sector

00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,630
folks in the room I thought I would

00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,000
share that yeah and then for color

00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,770
contrast I actually really like the

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,230
posse yellow groups color contrast

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,660
analyzer because not only does it check

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,750
for different forms of colorblindness or

00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:31,390
cataracts but also lets you select it

00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,860
give you color options for your palette

00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,390
so it's actually a really strong tool

00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,880
that's good yeah things with that's a

00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,340
totally non trust analyzer is by the

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,890
posse yellow group who works with wc3

00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:44,170
