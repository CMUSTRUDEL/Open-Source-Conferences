	00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,470
well before I get started - how many

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,910
marketers don't have in here good how

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,410
many I see somewhere in between let's

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,930
see like a good couple

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,939
look cool I think you'll all just

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,289
something out of this one I am going to

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,180
go ahead and get started and feel any

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,670
have right at 30 minutes so first I'm

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,680
going to introduce you to me I'm Shelly

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,690
Hutchins I'm director of client services

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,340
at media current it's been about 12

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,020
years pretty well split but through the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,760
marketing client services side of the

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,710
house and I want to tell you a few

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,879
things about me because as we go through

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,860
this presentation it's going to make a

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,020
lot of sense so the first thing you

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,660
should know is that I am a problem

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,219
solver by nature so I get really excited

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,289
about weaving through the web of things

00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,730
and coming out the other side with

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,250
something that makes a lot of sense

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,979
so those ask a broom yes completely my

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,830
bags my necklaces all get tangled up in

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,450
the bottom of my jewelry box and I kinda

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,430
get a little excited about it just who I

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,710
am second

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,830
I'm a data junkie so I think data tells

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,810
the story some of my favorite podcasts

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,210
are science versus and surprisingly

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,549
awesome I think it's now called every

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,189
little thing I'm also a podcast junkie

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,909
catch couldn't tell but because of those

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,240
two things

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,750
I asked why a lot which is kind of what

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,820
led me to this talk today and I do work

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,100
for media current as I said and then so

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,420
our goal is to answer that why that I

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,119
talked about by building the right

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,170
digital solution for that job so this

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,090
means we work with you from the

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,860
beginning of your project to define

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,810
those challenges and then we work with

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,090
Drupal and those other systems and

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,110
technologies and to give you in your

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,060
team what you need to

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,310
right so we don't say that we build

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,440
websites we have a highly complex

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,360
digital platform as it drives those

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:05,340
results and again we ask why a lot so

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,520
now we're going to talk about buzzwords

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,440
so look at these buzzwords they all tend

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,030
to mean something but what do they

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,470
really mean this is what we're going to

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,540
talk about today so we're going to talk

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,460
about a few of these popular Austin news

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,880
words and digital and marketing and

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,170
business we hear them and what happens

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,320
inevitably right you've been sitting

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,990
around a table and you hear Digital

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Ecosystem and you go and everybody else

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,580
goes hmm yep yep on board Digital

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,920
Ecosystem let's do it nobody ever says

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,209
wait what does that mean what does that

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,200
really mean right so that's what we're

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,840
going to talk about a little bit today

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,970
so take a look at the word clock how

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,030
many of you have used one of these words

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,690
this week how many of you want to be

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,930
today

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,550
right right so for the rest of our time

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,880
I'm going to cover the four most common

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,900
ones that I hear and like to talk about

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,280
and then if we have time we're going to

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,780
talk about a few of the ones that maybe

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,340
keep you guys up at night you can

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,530
rapid-fire a little bit and go back and

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,000
forth and see what comes out and as

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,530
you'll notice some of these are going to

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,820
cover because they have some real

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,670
meaning behind them and some of them

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,989
were not going to talk about because

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,790
seamless is something that we all say

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,790
and I think that we prettier clearly oh

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,540
and again so I'll be around all week so

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,100
I want to remind you that if I don't

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,230
cover one of these today we can talk

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,700
about it later I'll be at our booth I'll

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,050
be around and you can always find me on

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,630
LinkedIn so the first word I get

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,459
probably 50 emails a day that have

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,820
digital transformation in title any of

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,820
you guys write lots of that um so we're

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,330
going to start with a little QA somebody

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,880
tell me what digital transformation mean

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,330
anybody you guys don't want to play

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,630
today

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,650
okay okay so here's the definition that

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,120
you find on the Internet

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,790
I'm going to read it for you just so it

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,210
can sink in really good the profound and

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,850
accelerating transformation of business

00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,310
tivities processes competencies and

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,080
models to fully leverage the changes in

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,660
opportunities of digital technologies

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,800
and their impact on society in a

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,760
strategic and prioritized way can we

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,410
move on we good right but that's not how

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,450
people use it right I've heard digital

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,090
transformation used to talk about

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,740
augmented reality virtual reality to

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,590
talk about the importance of a remote

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,210
workforce and keeping them connected and

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,070
I've even used it myself to talk about

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,580
how large enterprises can effectively

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,290
use their inbound marketing tactics but

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,270
in practice digital transformation

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,100
really tends to be an umbrella term that

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,860
means something different for every

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,260
organization this is the key here going

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,450
through a full translation

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,390
transformation impacts your entire

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,820
digital library right so your website's

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,310
microsite mobile devices if you've got a

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,930
learning management system all the

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,950
places where you collect data your

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,560
social media e-commerce intranet it's an

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,150
umbrella term but you want to be using

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,640
technology to make a change while it's

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,870
true that it's each of these things can

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,250
be a driver for your digital

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,450
transformation it's just really

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,540
important that you think through the

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,480
details of what transformation means to

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,160
you and so when we're talking about this

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,960
transformation we're talking about a

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,910
shift in thinking starting with that

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,120
senior leadership right a full culture

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,910
shift so you need to take a hard look at

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,920
your strategy at your KPIs for the

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,020
upcoming year for more than that to

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,900
understand what the core goal is your

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,610
your transformation initiative is it

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,200
improving culture because you have an

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,960
international organization and you need

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,880
them better connected via your internet

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,280
is it implementing systems that that

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,800
slow down on these manual processes is

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,510
it creating a new website that more

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,300
closely aligns with your buyers journey

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,010
to revisit those goals and talk about

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,930
your technology and once you get there

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,700
you're going to find ways to improve

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,770
your operations your branding and

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,790
ultimately your your revenue and then

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,770
you're going to be able to find a

00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,170
roadmap that makes sense and digital

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,400
transformation isn't this thing that we

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,660
all want to happen someday somehow

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,620
starts to become something that's

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,630
attainable in order to really achieve

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,190
this that you have to be look forward

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,010
thinking you have to be thinking six

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:23,280
months two years even further and just

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,860
continue to ask those questions ask why

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,560
right I told you like that's why and ask

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,750
what next so that why keeps you grounded

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,150
in the now and that what's next

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,710
keeps you grounded in the future and

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,060
continuing to make sure that you're

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,250
thinking about those things in your

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,260
industry for yourself for your

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,330
competitors and really focused on what

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,160
that transformation is and when you're

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,050
thinking about what's next that's where

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,580
the transformation for you starts to

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,199
happen and when you hear digital it's

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,389
very easy to consider digital

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,139
transformation a technology challenge

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,810
right

00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,539
but in real practice it's our users

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,660
shift in behavior we're living in an age

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,280
where we're talking about chatbot a

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,250
reality to improve your user experience

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,990
and virtual reality is becoming a part

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,180
of daily lives right we're talking about

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,979
these these future things and and and

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,870
those are really cool things but don't

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,570
buy into the hype understand the needs

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,550
of your users and use technology to

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,830
solve that problem so here's a great

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,930
example the company that I used to work

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,060
for was an international supply chain

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,789
finance company right our target for

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,889
CFOs of companies to billion dollars or

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,139
more in revenues virtual reality

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,330
probably not the right thing for them

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,389
but you know maybe I'm a company that

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,030
sell a new technology a new vehicle

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,770
listing a new driving experience right

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,419
if I can't bring them all to the car for

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,370
how this virtual reality is the perfect

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,080
way to start to transfer my business

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,139
there right so don't design to the

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,550
technology because it sounds really cool

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,260
really understand your buyers and

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,820
understanding what technology is going

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,820
to help them make the right decisions

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,750
so we're going to take digital

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,280
transformation from a buzzword for

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,229
something we can get behind again it's a

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,729
shift in mindset it's not just a

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,250
technical shift it's is shifting their

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:14,419
nusers behavior it's focused on users

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,419
data and forward thinking so unlike Big

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,699
Foot it is real and we can debate that

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,080
later if you want but the takeaway is

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,669
that it's real it's needed but it's

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,979
different for every organization so

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,539
media current we want to ask you why we

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,910
want our strategy team to work with you

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,889
to ask what's next and for our own

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,510
organization we do the same thing we're

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,070
asking those questions we survey our

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,599
customers we want to hear what we're

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,909
doing well what we're doing not so well

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,510
that we can get better and we can use

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,800
the right technology for the job

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,130
that's what digital transformation at

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,490
the end of the day really means

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:54,110
so the next one is digital ecosystem

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:55,940
anybody so here is the generally

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,800
accepted definition an interdependent

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,510
group of enterprises people endure

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,630
things that share standardized digital

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,950
platforms for a mutually beneficial

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,400
purpose such as commercial gain

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,050
innovation common interest but when you

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,580
hear the word ecosystem you probably

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,220
think of a visual like this from

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,650
elementary school right this illustrates

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,630
how every living thing exists because of

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,430
every other living thing right so you've

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,620
got plankton and fish and they go up to

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,779
the smaller animals and ultimately to

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,300
humans and we all exist because of the

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,400
other so if we apply this to a digital

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,650
ecosystem we're saying that if you have

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,040
standalone systems you're operating in

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,870
silos

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,290
you're just not maximizing your

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,570
investment it's not enough to understand

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,700
that connections need to exist right

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,260
like the digital like the ecosystem that

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,650
we just saw it's important that the

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,370
right connections exist

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,079
Unser's that they're feeding the

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,360
necessary information to each other what

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,510
you see here is an example of a digital

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,400
ecosystem from one of our customers as

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,570
you see every single system isn't a

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,070
hundred percent integrated with the

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,290
others right that doesn't make sense for

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,940
them but the right connections are made

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,120
so that their marketing automation

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,620
system can work to provide

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,540
personalization another buzzword we'll

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,430
talk about that

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,380
and then their marketing automation

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,230
systems feeding back to their comm and

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,339
they're able to work to even personalize

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,310
further to give them the right

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,810
information the right learning to say me

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,100
and I won't take turn left here but

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,899
marketing automation and data management

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,009
is something I get really excited about

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,839
to you so something else you can discuss

00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,850
so all of that said the important part

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,800
about digital ecosystem is that what

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,019
we're talking about are making

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,779
connections between your technologies so

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,279
this ear plugging is not a strategy

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,100
right you have to be focused on

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,600
communicating outside of your silo

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,420
marketing should work with delivery to

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,709
work with internal IT at one of my

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,940
previous companies here's another

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:51,190
example

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,670
so I was in charge of our comm and our

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,560
marketing automation our IT system our

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,230
IT team rather was in charge of our

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,050
internet which was a struggling

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,300
SharePoint site and our product team was

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,519
working to build our products via Ruby

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,589
on Rails with a team in India and here

00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,139
working together pretty much 24 hours to

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:14,860
develop our technology but we were all

00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:17,800
operating pretty separately I was

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,690
talking to Ron ago someone at media

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,880
clearing about a Drupal migration our

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,279
product team was working on implementing

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,319
some some JIRA technology to help with

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,170
their project management and then our IT

00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:31,389
team all the while by themselves were

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:36,730
working and had rolled out a brand new

00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:38,050
intranet a new SharePoint site so dad

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,670
didn't work for us right we had already

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,839
established that didn't work for many

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,970
teams but because we weren't

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,130
communicating no one was on the same

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,500
page that we got another SharePoint site

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,319
that very quickly went the way of the

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,970
other but have we communicated we may

00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,829
have been able to avoid those licensing

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,050
fees and found the right integrations

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,339
and and and found an open source

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,790
solution for us that would have worked

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,410
for all levels so we're going to sum it

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,980
up it's relevant right you go systems

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,480
Ron connections not just content

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,399
reimagine your properties as a system

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,529
that shares data and functionality and

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,750
things like you know drupelets API first

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,639
technology makes that possible for you

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,350
makes you able to think of all of the

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,180
various way but it doesn't limit you

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,520
ways that perhaps we were before so

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,070
we're going to move on next one

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:33,010
agile how many of you guys say agile

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:39,900
work agile okay every single day so what

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:42,190
does it mean able to move quickly easily

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,390
relating ordinary to a method of project

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,820
management right this is probably the

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,320
definition we know so I'm going to go

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,000
through a couple of things here and this

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,670
is based on some recent experiences that

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,180
I've heard or seen in several different

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,460
instances so what al Giles doesn't mean

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,010
it doesn't mean you don't need a plan

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,020
right it also doesn't mean we'll figure

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,920
out that really complex functionality

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,660
later and it also doesn't mean I mean

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,690
there's no schedule there's no timeline

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,540
no defined deliverables there should be

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,160
and this is the one that I get I wasn't

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,260
going to include a first bit but over

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,990
the past I'm saying six eight months I

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,120
hear as I'll used a lot in discussion

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,680
but I think a lot of people get a little

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,140
confused about what it actually means so

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,900
the reason agile is beneficial is

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,870
because it allows you to iterate a lot

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,030
it allows you to run small tests learn

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,230
from them and then make better decisions

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,520
on the next test that you're going to

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,010
run in the next four it you're going to

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,330
go through like I said before I spend a

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,680
lot of time on the marketing side of the

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,390
house and when I think of agile agile

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,360
marketing is also something we're using

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,640
a lot and what it means again is that I

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,740
can run a small campaign I can learn the

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,570
success of that my messaging who I'm

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,270
sending it to the time of day whatever

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,070
it is how what personalized content I'm

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,680
serving up you know all of those things

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,510
I can test on small levels learn from

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,090
them and continue to adjust so I can

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,160
improve my speed predictability and then

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,770
I can also adapt so I'm accomplishing

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,840
things but along the way I'm able to run

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,660
these small additional tests to make me

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,730
better I still know that I want to

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,500
deliver either so many campaigns so many

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,320
pieces of content I'm still focused on

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,880
them so running that way but then I can

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,640
maybe try something that's a little on

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,390
left-field in a contest so I can test

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,670
learn and improve I can learn faster I

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:34,029
when quickly and I can fail quickly and

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,070
then I can continue to problem-solve I

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,019
can always find a way to be better and

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,209
from a problem-solving standpoint so

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,149
this graphic over here is an example of

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,010
a sprint cycle and media current but

00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,670
again you can apply this to a lot of

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,529
different places

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,930
agile marketing is one of the words that

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,519
I hear a lot now the concepts though is

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,200
that you've got a plan you're still

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
running on the strong things that you

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,370
know you want to do but these smaller

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,320
cycles allow you to really learn and

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,820
grow and change and try things you might

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,860
not normally do if you were going to be

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:08,350
a three month really expensive test so

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,329
agile helps you continuously learn don't

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,730
use agile as a crutch to avoid those

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,740
harde planning sessions focus on quick

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,640
wins and leveraging your successes to

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,769
fuel your team

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,240
so when you say agile you mean let's

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,920
move quickly but you don't mean let's

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,360
move in twelve different directions at

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,769
once you still want to have that roadmap

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,070
in the plan you're following so the last

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:32,110
word I'm going to cover right now

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,690
personalization I think we all know what

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,029
this is right designer tailored to meet

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,010
an individual's needs or specifications

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,560
meeting their needs more effectively

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,899
efficiently increasing customer

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,560
satisfaction the likelihood of repeat

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,029
visits this step and I'm about to show

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,649
you I think I've used in just about

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,930
every presentation I've given in the

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,630
past year because it made such an impact

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,920
on me even some of our teams using it

00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,740
now because they get really excited

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,649
about it too by 2020 customers will

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,390
manage 85 percent of their relationship

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,260
with you without ever talking to a

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:10,360
person 85 percent that's huge that means

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,880
they're going to use web your app or

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,130
even text messaging to interact with you

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,050
never speaking to a person Delta does

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,490
this really well now via Twitter right

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,140
you can get an answer on Twitter much

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,050
quicker if you've ever called anyone at

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,459
the company because they've responded to

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,310
the fact that that's how people interact

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:29,290
with them so this customer preferences

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,810
and behaviors have changed and those

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,540
buying journeys are so self-directed and

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,390
digitally led now which means that more

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,680
than ever it's important that these

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,900
types of marketing for the

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,510
customer-facing and and revenue

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,490
generating function more than that it's

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,170
important that large companies can

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,480
harness this to have that one-on-one

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,200
digital conversation with their customer

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
at scale again Delta is a great example

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,080
they're they're starting to do it right

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:02,250
so this buzzword like the others we

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,930
covered is not hype it is very much so a

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,100
rome wasn't built in a day

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,570
scenario when you understand what it

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,400
means you've still got to define what

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:15,510
personalization means for your

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,870
organization so you've got to start by

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,030
defining your why so define what your

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,860
goal is you know for one of our clients

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,780
it's they're designed for travel and

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,209
tourism they their goal is to serve up

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,740
more content to you based on the places

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,880
you've said you want to go or the places

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,640
that you've checked out that you want to

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,890
visit it could be conversions for

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,770
e-commerce more relevant purchases like

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,930
Amazon does for us but you want to

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,360
define what that Y is that helps you

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,040
understand how to personalize it doesn't

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,650
mean that every piece of your site

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,550
should be personalized and I do want to

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,650
say personalization I suppose well I

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,970
suppose personalization is you know hi

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,340
Shelley how are you today

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,890
how's media current and it's a funny

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,390
story because when I first started using

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,670
marketing automation that's what they

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,110
were saying we offer personalization you

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,420
can customize your emails with your

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,810
client name and their company and and

00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,240
well that's true it's we've evolved so

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,900
much further than that right so you want

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,610
to be defining the what next it's about

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,990
the content that you're giving them it's

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,510
about the messaging that you're giving

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,430
them it's about the context that you're

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,310
using to communicate with them so you

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:30,000
want to define with that what is and

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:31,710
then you get to what the how is the why

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,300
and what move you down to choosing the

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,820
right technologies the right interaction

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,250
so in some cases you might have

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,600
personalization built into your

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,630
marketing automation system or another

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,500
piece of your technology stack but if

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,080
not you don't want to work to something

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,980
your needs this is something that I tell

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,310
clients a lot you don't buy a Maserati

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,990
or a Ferrari to drive at 50 miles an

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,360
hour right that would be no fun right

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,150
you buy a fast car because you want it

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,430
to go so do the same thing with your

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,320
technology don't go out and buy the most

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,910
expensive technology with all the bells

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,580
and whistles because it's a shiny new

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,500
toy right take the right technology to

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,680
serve you if you need something really

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,600
complex then choose that tool but also

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,430
go out there and look for other pieces

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,410
of technology that potentially still

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,270
accomplish what you need without

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,030
breaking your bank because you are going

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,650
to get started again it's a long process

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,750
we're talking about agile and we're

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,400
talking about personalization you're

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,380
going to want to test a lot along the

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,790
way and iterate and make changes until

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,470
you find the right balance that works

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:41,200
for you to buy align the Y wins again

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,840
you're asking why you want to build the

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,070
right team and the hype is real

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,990
personalization works it does work

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,220
you've got it you've got to learn how it

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:55,750
works for your audience

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:57,190
but it works so I have eight minutes so

00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,920
for these last few minutes I want to try

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,780
something you can ask a question but if

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,810
there's a buzzword that you get bug view

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,010
we can do a little bit of a rapid-fire -

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,590
Renee I can give you myself

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,450
there and you can give me yours but

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,040
let's think about the ones that really

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,490
do mean something so we don't need to

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:19,080
talk about synergy right or low-hanging

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,370
fruit or less feeling to Gustin others

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,170
close the loop right we know what those

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,510
things mean but there's really one you

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,160
want to get to the bottom of let's chat

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,720
and I'm happy to answer some more

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,720
questions with the time we've got left

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:40,049
on these channels when I hear a lot you

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:42,840
know I left it out because I would sure

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:44,610
would have time to me omni-channel

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,860
means understanding all the channels

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,570
that are available to you much like

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,490
we're talking about your ecosystem right

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,679
understanding all of this possible

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,600
channels and and acting on the right

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,490
ones for you so omni-channel

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,049
when you hear it people that are

00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,730
companies that are saying they want to

00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,649
be on me channel to me are companies

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,720
that want to sit are saying we want to

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:06,570
be globally recognized leaders in every

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,029
space possible for our vertical and

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,649
that's that's great but really it's

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,000
about understanding you're focused on

00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,679
every channel that your users are

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,210
interacting in that's kind of my take on

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,529
on the channel we could talk more

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,899
there's I think there's more to it than

00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,429
that but but basically when we say it

00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:25,830
that's what we need whether or not

00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:27,510
that's actually the truth anybody else

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:32,549
any questions anything I didn't cover

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:35,519
anybody disagree big Dana I was like I

00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,529
said before I love data so we're

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,880
collecting and I think I've heard it

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,080
described this way the other day you

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,299
know we're pretty much leaving tiny

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,850
little fingerprints all over the web and

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,230
people like me when I was a marketer got

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,029
really excited about that because I

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,330
could know whatever I wanted to and talk

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:53,519
to you in whatever way but the reality

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,460
is once you get into that finding a way

00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,080
to to get all that data in one place and

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,450
get it synthesized together where it

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,679
actually makes sense you know I mean

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,120
there's a piece here there's a piece

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,590
here but to get it into a place that

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,970
would actually make sense that's what

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,820
people are saying when they say big data

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,679
right is what technology can I find and

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,090
to be honest you know I've heard of

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,679
Hadoop but I don't know all of the

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,299
details but I know that we're all trying

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,549
to solve that same problem because we're

00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,649
trying to find the right tool to get all

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,360
of those little pieces into one system

00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:23,010
so that we can we can visualize it

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,929
better data visualization is another one

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,580
right we're always looking for ways to

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,779
see all of the information that we've

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,840
gotten there are some software's out

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,370
there that a try but I think there's

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,000
probably still a magic bullet that we

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,000
haven't found yet

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,690
okay so I'll be around if you want to

00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,480
chat anymore about buzzwords or you know

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,870
data management or podcast thank you

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,600
guys

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:55,600
