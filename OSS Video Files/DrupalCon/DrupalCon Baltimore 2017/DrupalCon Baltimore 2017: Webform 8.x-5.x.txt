Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Webform 8.x-5.x is the latest iteration of Drupal's most popular form builder and submission manager.  The Webform module for Drupal 8 is a completely new code base, that takes a different, but familiar approach to solving the challenges of building rich, flexible, and maintainable client facing forms for a Drupal website.  The new Webform module includes many new features and leverages improvements in Drupal 8, including OO design patterns, extendable plugins, and automated tests.

The goal of this session is to get you familiar with the Drupal 8 version of the Webform module, inspire you to use this module to build awesome forms, and to ultimately convince you to extend and contribute code and ideas back to the Drupal and Webform community.

Webform 8.x-5.x has something for everyone...

Developers can now edit the source code behind a form.
Site builders can quickly and easily build any type of form with dozens of new form elements.
Themers can style a form's layout and elements to their heart's content.
Site owners get a happy team that can be build awesome forms, faster and cheaper.
This session will cover…

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
this is a really dumb slide I have it

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,730
here for me to set the context we're

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,529
building forms this is a contact form

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,090
this is the contact form that the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,889
webform ships with it's copied from the

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,480
content for from core it's a contact

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,910
form that everyone's familiar with it

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,420
just has four fields name email subject

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,859
and message and the second part of the

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,470
web for mods was to collect the data

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,939
from this form as a submission and this

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,460
is what a submission looks like in

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,510
Drupal 8 we have the data in your system

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,269
and then you can send it through email

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,410
and there's some history of the web for

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,660
module for Drupal 8 that I'm just going

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,829
to quickly go through I worked on an

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,390
early adoption of Memorial

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,770
sloan-kettering early adoption of Drupal

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,030
8 for Memorial sloan-kettering Cancer

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,340
Center they started on an alpha release

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,020
of Drupal and they launched on a data

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,550
but the web flow module was not ported

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,840
to blade in 2015 and we did an MVP

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,190
solution which we called llamó form I

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,930
will show that to you but it was just a

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,550
way to get forms built as quickly and

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,289
simply as possible so we could launch

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,399
the site and sloan-kettering is still

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,680
using that module but they're in the

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,530
process of migrating over the web for

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,619
module and in 2016 is actually like in

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,060
Christmas Day I contributed the ammo for

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,350
module back to the Drupal community that

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,240
was when I created the project and

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,890
worked all through 2016

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,619
towards the end there's an issue that

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,150
was created but let's change the Yamma

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,640
for modules name because no one knows

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,049
what this means and it went in a lot of

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,580
different directions someone suggested

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,350
super forum or something else and

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,960
finally some said well just call it

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,520
webform and I was hesitant but then the

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,869
thread went on in quick steps got

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,939
involved and we renate we basically

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,650
moved the yamo form codebase into the

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,470
web form module in the bright the

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,060
beginning of 2017 and the two most

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,189
immediate differences I'll talk about is

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,900
the EM homage was a very developers

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,540
specific that was how I saw it through

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,399
centric helping developers and the web

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,509
for modules more for developers and site

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,189
builders and you'll start to see the

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,170
rusical move on so I want to just give a

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,509
quick overview what what what is the mo

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,570
form well the animal form for me was

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,240
just taking a form of this getting

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,439
technical but a form API rendered a and

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,290
serializing in Tiamo

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,850
so this is how Jupiter is this is a

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,229
render array just written out in the

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,869
amyloid it's just described there's a

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,540
name field the text text field

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,319
email it's an email field and everyone's

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,840
pretty familiar

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,689
and this was what Yamma form was you

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,159
would go and edit this using using a

00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,799
code me router you go and edit this

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,010
llamo and you have a form and to me what

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,590
a webform is it's just a UI on top of

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,019
that API it's just a way to give someone

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,730
a visual of GUI to move around these

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,109
fields and also to access a lot more

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,180
information sometimes it's hard to know

00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:40,139
all the properties available and form

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,379
API and I want to give a quick demo of

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,750
what the general workflow of the new

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,180
webform module is doing so I'm going to

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,739
go to the contact form and show to you

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,109
or make sure everyone conceived it so

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,519
here's the basic contact form and for

00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,540
this demo I really like doing something

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,709
really simple and say let's add a

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,409
company field so we click on tax field

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,699
I'm going to add company and something

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,379
I'm going to emphasize as I go through

00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,909
the presentation there's a lot settings

00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,730
you don't have to do two chips with

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,019
reasonable default so all I did was

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,519
title the field I'm not going to change

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,040
any of these I am going to expand all as

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,010
I scroll just to show you you can change

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,650
any aspect of an element I'm going to

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,139
hit save and add the element I'm going

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,060
to go view it and I've deliberately made

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,349
a mistake here because I I put the

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,299
company field but really should say your

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,709
company it should be at the top right

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,659
under your name and should be required

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,409
and I want to show you yes you can do

00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:37,049
this in the UI could drag it up you can

00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,489
hit required hit save go hit edit that's

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,560
a couple of steps so I'm talk about four

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,209
or five steps or you can still get to

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,609
the source mode of the yamo which is

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,379
this and sorry to bend down but you got

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,909
to look at it bring it up and you start

00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:54,259
to see the power behind being able to

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,259
edit the source code behind the form

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,490
company and now you can get the ability

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,690
to cut and paste and I hit save and now

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm going to jump over the test app and

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,190
you can see I made the change

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,690
scroll down and what the tests tab does

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,830
is it Auto populates a form with

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,840
reasonable suppose that you have access

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,220
to there's a yamo configuration file

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,690
that you can control what email

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,160
addresses are being used as your test

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,410
date if you have custom elements you

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:28,060
need very specific test data you can

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:30,560
populate that I'm going to hit Send back

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,960
and now the second part we've done the

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,190
form building aspect this is the results

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,750
people are very familiar with this in

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,000
Drupal 7 some changes that have happened

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,410
is I've merged the submissions and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,870
tables table so you get one table that

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,160
you can actually customize the columns

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,440
and select which columns you want

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,930
visible on this view we've also

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,450
integrated flagging and storing so you

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,570
can add notes or you can flag the

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,590
submission over here and then this is

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,910
the moment where I'm gonna jump into a

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,780
submission and probably not come back

00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,670
this because I think it's pretty

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,710
sensible to people is you look at your

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,970
data there's a table view something that

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,340
we're seeing here is these are this is a

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,020
very small form but yamo web forms and

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,910
Yamaka can handle hundreds of them

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,440
elements you can have a form with a

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,000
hundred fields on it it can handle it

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,530
and that's kind of why this table views

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,400
here because if you have that size form

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,760
you're going to need a quick way to

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,919
scroll through the data there's also a

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,390
plain text tab to just be able to kind

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,800
of get a sense of what do data look like

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,470
if you're sending it through a plain

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,430
text email or SMS and there's by the way

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,200
you again we're getting into the

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,940
developer features there's a data tab to

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,360
show you the raw data that's stored in

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,890
the database

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,750
it just helps people make sense of

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,140
what's going on including that there's a

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,090
UUID there's a secure token the language

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,490
is being a code you know tracked and the

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,110
remote email does and then there's some

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,570
other features where you can go in and

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,250
resend the email notifications you can

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,479
delete it I'm going to get to this a

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,460
little later Braille to show you there's

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,720
some logging specific to submissions

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,400
this helps with very complex

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,870
applications to know exactly what's

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,040
going on as your data is moving around

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,200
when did you get to more complex

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,790
applications I found it this is a

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,350
business requirement that I needed to

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,960
know what was going on to each

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,610
submission I'm going to jump back to the

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,100
presentation and now we're going to back

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,220
up and go into like what's new what's

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,740
missing

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,810
um this is completely rewritten codebase

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,610
its object or its Drupal 8 it's written

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,640
as an object-oriented code base

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,140
everything is broken down into services

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,170
with dependencies injections and

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,970
interfaces with a lot of plugins tied to

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,260
that and you've seen the editing the

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,940
source feature it's really one of the

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,410
unique features to this module into the

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,120
form builder space in general that

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,330
you're able to go in and update a form

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,800
with 100 fields on it there are 70 plus

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,660
web form elements available and I'll

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,980
demo those in a little while there are

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,020
hundreds of custom settings I'm not

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,390
holding back on any setting my concept

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,730
is expose every setting that you

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,770
possibly imagine make it work in default

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,060
and Drupal is flexible enough if you

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,770
have users that you don't show all those

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,390
settings so you can write a formal to

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,970
hook and start hiding them using pound

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,920
access there's also support for

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,990
composites and multi values composites

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,760
are basically like a field collection

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,140
cup if you're doing an address field you

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,550
want three or four elements mixed

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,410
together to create that address field

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,270
and multiple value support to help

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,870
support things like multiple addresses

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,370
or multiple URLs or multiple links um

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,560
similar what trees brought up in the

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,669
presentation it's really important that

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,500
things work out of the box so I'm

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,910
including examples in templates examples

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,650
just show you a kitchen sink of

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,720
everything working and templates are

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,540
starting points they're just like here's

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,890
how you might want to do a donation form

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,690
and then there's customizable results

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,919
which I did demo and there's a lot more

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,500
documentation you're going to see that

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,700
it was as we move on the what's missing

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,590
is kind of what people are working a

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,120
views integration is happening someone's

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,010
working on a web forum views mods where

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,229
they had an elf release yesterday it

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,330
worked really well

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:43,919
I'm the person who's maintained instead

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,660
of doing a great job and you should

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,210
download that module give him feedback

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,190
it's very responsive rules integration I

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,960
think this is I've done some assessment

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,300
of other modules this is hurting a lot

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,340
of modules in the community because

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,750
rules allows incredible flexibility

00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,010
there's certain points where module's

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,540
can't implement certain types of

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,650
conditional logic and rules can step in

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,030
and make it possible for a site builder

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,740
drag-and-drop WYSIWYG UI it's just like

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,710
people there's a form builder module

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,750
that has an imported Rupali the UI right

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,640
now is more of a we're working on a

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,830
quick outside-in initiative to make it a

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,830
little easier but that's definitely

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:27,270
and then conditionals was kind of redone

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,250
to match up with um course states API to

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,540
leverage how core is doing conditional

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,130
logic but there's a limitation there

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,320
where it's all front-end client-side

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,180
JavaScript with no back-end server side

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
validation and cross page conditionals

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,330
are missing these are things that can be

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,280
added in but I wanted to start aligning

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,530
more with core instead of doing self

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,750
completely custom statistics and charts

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,310
for me is completely out of the core web

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,990
form module space I think that should be

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,940
handled in a separate control and

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,980
there's third parties that just do it a

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,480
lot better so to do pie charts

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,160
personally I would go in the Google Docs

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,460
direction of pushing your web form data

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,200
into Google and having them handle it

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,510
they start sticking toward third-party

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,730
integrations where the web for its Anouk

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,250
okay so people just report things over

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,750
so we need sub modules to do various

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,610
people modules to do like MailChimp

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,100
integration but we actually see things

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,840
like Salesforce integration payment I

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,700
think is a big deal for a small site if

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,230
you're not doing a large commerce I have

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,090
a simple way to collect an event

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,640
registration payment is very useful

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,830
feature and then d6 and d7 migration

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:30,300
there are dedicated people are spinning

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,770
up to do that and I think a few people

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,630
have had successful migrations but

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,460
there's not like a canonical this is the

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,050
migration module and this is what I

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,580
recommend using but I think people and

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,880
then it really leads to more people

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,230
evolve more contributors to back up to

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,490
say the migration is going to happen

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,330
with more people getting involved with

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,430
it so this is a quickness of cool stuff

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,870
because I can't get to all of this I

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,760
just want to run through some of the new

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,290
features that I am very proud of that

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
people help contribute especially the

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,150
like you can do anonymous drafts now and

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,620
there's with that we did automatic

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,540
purging of drafts so you don't have your

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,740
database fill up with hundreds of drafts

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,660
but allow someone who's not on us to

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,850
come to your site and save it and just

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,340
drops the session variable and then come

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,160
back and start working on the form with

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,690
anonymous dress you can have those

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,130
convert to authenticated drafts when

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,870
someone logs in it's very similar to how

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,330
you go to a site with as a shopping cart

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,830
and you say they say login and you login

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,750
and the shopping cart follows through

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,310
with you it's really cool for very large

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,840
application processes where at some

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,170
point you want to just recommend someone

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,759
to login

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:36,600
select boxes radios the options are now

00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,670
able there's a dedicated API to get your

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,189
likert options or states or countries

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,209
and the model ships with examples of all

00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:46,319
those but you can set up your own

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:47,939
options built in is you can do custom

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,499
JavaScript and style C injection

00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,759
directly into your form it just makes it

00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:52,499
a little more flexible because I I've

00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,389
ran into it forms you need little

00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:56,759
nuances chains if you need to adjust the

00:10:54,389 --> 00:11:00,179
margin of something even this addresses

00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:02,550
some conditional logic where's no way

00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,139
that states API or any API can handle

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,300
certain conditional logic and you can

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,220
inject that JavaScript and cheerful I've

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,439
also included is opening and closing a

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,939
forums based on scheduled dates it's

00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,879
really helpful for event registration

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:16,439
application processes form and element

00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,029
access controls which is built-in so you

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,889
have full ability to control who can

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,779
access what forms what elements

00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:25,740
submissions based on roles and user

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,119
accounts sending email to assign roles

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,470
it's just a very useful for an

00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,889
application process you can say I want

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,629
to send you Minister for reviewers and

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,029
then scheduling emails is just a really

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,589
cool feature that I will get to a little

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,939
more towards the end logging in

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,679
submissions I showed you a third party

00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,179
setting integration and something I

00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,220
personally like which is a silly cool

00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,629
feature is dismissible my messages and

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,959
you'll start to see those as I start

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:54,839
demoing it it's just a UX experience as

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:57,449
you move through the module so who built

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,649
the module I think it's really important

00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,800
to thank quick session the maintainer

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:07,980
zuv webform seven decks quick judgmental

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:11,519
yeah please they've been doing it he's

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,170
been doing it since 2006 I still reflect

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,370
back on his code and I am amazed at some

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,799
of the things he did with that module

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,079
and how robust it is and some of the

00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,059
just all the work that went into it and

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,009
it's important I think to emphasize it

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,199
still lives on seven Drupal seven

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,119
support is moving into backdrop CMS and

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,160
web forms is supported with backdrops so

00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:31,170
if you are in a seven site you might

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,569
look at that option and these numbers

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,420
are just stunning a half a million sites

00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:38,879
are using the web for module and 3.6

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,240
million downloads is astounding for a

00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,390
web form builder

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,279
in the stats and to get into why I did

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,430
it I want you can she contribute

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,080
something I had this thing I'm obsessive

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,520
person I like to focus on one project

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,410
this is how my mind works I enjoyed

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,180
working on long term project I've worked

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,220
on the sloan-kettering side for 15 years

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,380
it's just how my mind works

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,390
I like that focus and you know moving

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,490
things forward and I really felt

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,250
Jubilate needs a form builder solution I

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,600
also felt that open sources reform bills

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,480
are switched in the sense of how Drupal

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,190
is so open and it's free here's a

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,529
solution you can do whatever you want

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,060
with it and in the open source form

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,940
building community there's not those

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,050
very powerful completely free open form

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,050
building solutions out there I mean

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,370
WordPress as I'm moving on I'll say I'm

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,990
going to get to WordPress and show some

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,990
demos of it not demos but to talk about

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,760
but to really talk about why you should

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,160
use this module because it's kind of the

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,570
open source side of it it is it's open

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,610
source it allows your website to collect

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,470
data that that's my recommendation

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,210
that's what I come down to and and

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,339
there's a use case here that is really a

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,660
flow to this drupal the triple 7 verse

00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,820
in Drupal 8 hits it's where you build a

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,890
form copy template you publish this form

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,660
to page under block you collect your

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,089
submissions you send confirmation

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,430
certifications you review the results on

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,990
my new downloading and I boiled down to

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,550
these three points which is Bill collect

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,150
and download that that's what the web 4

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,920
modules for and what I did notice when I

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,320
started researching the web for module 4

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,760
Drupal 7 and looking at the community I

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,850
saw this other use case which I'm

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,980
calling distribute where people are

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,570
collecting this data but more and more

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,160
it's like the headless concept is

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,020
sometimes the data just doesn't need to

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,540
go into Drupal or you get the data in

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,279
you need to route it to your CRM and to

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,380
focus on this notion that you're

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,820
distributing the data and to be honest

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,810
sending an email is distributing the

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,000
data

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,589
I personally on some most of the web

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,540
forms I do in Drupal 7 I was turning off

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:37,370
the saving of results and just sending

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,230
emails so what are the alternatives I

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,430
think with Drupal in any project you

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,980
should look at the alternatives and

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,930
understand what's going on and every

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,080
product here is is amazing in its own

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:51,020
right and worth looking at I use Google

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,940
Forms everyday I think job forms is

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,930
incredible robust and then the open

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,460
source space where

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,800
Kress has some amazing for Building

00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,540
Solutions ninja forms is amazing UX

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,180
experience there they're kind of saying

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,490
the the baseline for what you could do

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,230
in a user experience on how you're

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,180
managing a forms a formal presented last

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,160
year they're very robust solution and

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,290
they have their at Drupal con so their

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,060
their presentation still available and I

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,270
do want to emphasize in core there is a

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,980
contact form module you must enable it

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,380
and look at it and see if it addresses

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,240
your requirements if it does use it if

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,550
it doesn't then look at the webform

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,380
module and Camille and maybe leverage

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,040
that because court is shipping with a

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,470
solution to building forms and it's

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,120
going to keep growing I'm no dressing a

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,010
much more specific use case a more

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,990
robust use case and there is a

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,580
comparison that I can show you where

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,190
we're starting to break down what one

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,020
module is for and what are the features

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,360
and yet where do you get started with

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,860
this so I want to emphasize the web four

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,540
modules a complete solution for building

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,040
forms something I'm striving for you

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,709
turn it on and you have an experience

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,779
that works that you're like boom this

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,450
addresses this my requirements for this

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,580
project and then you can consider what

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,770
specific like you can go out and get

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,839
add-ons and features but I'm not trying

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,760
to hold back on any concepts in the

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,410
module and it does start off with

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,020
downloading the module enabling it is

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,640
broken up into some sub modules there's

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,140
a core module and the UI is a dedicated

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,000
module the examples of the dedicated

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,589
module and there's a lot of dependencies

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,779
on external libraries which I'll get to

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,550
and you have it's strongly recommended

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,440
that you install them and then yes you

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,209
can go out and get add-on functionality

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,070
which is basically contributes to do

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:32,720
stuff like MailChimp integration webform

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,220
views and there's also a lot of help

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,420
available there's documentation I'm

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,800
starting to work on a cookbook which

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,370
I'll show you in a second I'm doing a

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,480
lot of screencast because I think it

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,829
makes a big difference it makes people

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,290
feel a lot more comfortable when they're

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:48,140
learning some new system and drupal

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,029
answers has a good flow of questions and

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,160
people are responding to them and I'm

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,990
very active in the issue queue so you

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,060
can definitely post your bugs and issues

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,000
there and the demo I want to just

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,160
quickly show if this is just walking

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,690
through you know I have it I did it's

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,780
all installed but you get this in line

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,189
this is a dismissable message it's helps

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,550
get you started off where it shows you

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,710
with

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,260
modules are and for me I have them all

00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,780
enabled and there's also a link over to

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,030
the add-ons where I am trying to keep a

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,170
list of all the available modules that

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,300
you might want to install with the

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,680
webform out and some of them are webform

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,930
specific some are not

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,090
I like the client side validation module

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,860
if it's an amazing module improving the

00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,540
UX of all forms of course Drupal and

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,150
what I like about as you turn it on it

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:37,280
works it does what it says it does to

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,390
back up I'm also I want to emphasize the

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,410
third-party libraries because this is

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,720
one of the steps that people need to

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,850
understand I have a lot of requirements

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,500
here they are all optional now you can

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,910
turn off any of these libraries as an

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,710
admin setting and if you actually

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,020
uncheck a library that will go out and

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,270
take it out of you it will not install

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,010
it it will not be part of it but a lot

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,890
of these libraries help with the user

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,090
experience and had really nice nuanced

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,980
features of the web for mojo

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,780
and to get them as well there's drush

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,420
commands available you basically need to

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,010
run you know like Russ libraries

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,290
installed there's also abilities to

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,750
generate make files and composer files I

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,790
do not recommend manually going out and

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,290
getting twelve libraries and cutting and

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,770
picking up dragging dropping them into

00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:20,420
your directory and now with

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,860
documentation I kind of wanted to show

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,210
you some of the videos I'm not going to

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,680
show videos going to show you that when

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,570
you install the module these dismissal

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,920
messages are meant to help you out but

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,080
once you close and they go away and

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,060
there's this video is basically the

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,980
presentation we're doing now but as you

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,720
navigate through I'm trying to set up

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,480
screencasts to help you understand what

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,840
templates are and I'll gradually

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:46,430
reworking them as the module progresses

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,840
on drupal.org there's documentation so

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm the documentation in the module is

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,980
repeated rupal org it just helps get

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,810
people more familiar for me the two

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,550
things I kind of want to show and I'm

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,960
actually going to skip I'm going to show

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,210
you the cookbook because I think it also

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,860
starts to get to show you my favorite

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:06,830
recipe how to programmatically alter

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:11,600
destination you know just so why I love

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:13,130
this recipe is there's some point where

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,960
you can't write this conditional logic

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,550
into the UI this conditional logic

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,860
someone is contributing back is

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,690
basically taking

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,280
user submitted their current language of

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,350
theirs what language they speak and

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,510
routing the email address to a language

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,340
specific email address it's a really

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,780
simple example it makes a lot of sense

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,730
and what's really cool about it is it

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,190
shows you the full power of duplicate in

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,330
the sense of extending the email Handler

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,000
and they're writing a few lines of code

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,590
and they've got this example if you

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,210
bring it in to your own like you write

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,980
your own my custom handler you can do

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,799
any type of custom logic you could even

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,540
do custom formatting with your emails it

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:53,630
just shows you the flexibility that I'm

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:55,309
after with the api's moving on so now

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,950
again to the need of what what can you

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,020
do with the module well allows you to

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,640
build any type of form I'm really trying

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,040
to do a no-holds-barred you can build

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:08,210
any form you could possibly imagine or

00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,770
have a requirement to build and the way

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,330
you get to that point is you have to

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,770
learn from the examples templates and

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,480
even the tests help out because every

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,860
feature has a dedicated test so if

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,030
you're getting into some hard level API

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,880
is it's worth looking at some of the

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,410
tests and the examples that I'm going to

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,299
walk you through we got to look at the

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,950
elements and the composites multi-column

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,710
layouts a really important thing to get

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,580
familiar with multi-step form wizard

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,290
conditional logic and I'm even

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,440
introducing a concept of demo

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,480
applications which is basically getting

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,730
like a set of forms working together to

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,200
build a complex application process so

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,640
it's like an example but it's a rich

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
example where it's more than just one

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,030
form I'll show that to you and I think

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,530
it'll make perfect sense would see and I

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,270
think the reusable templates help for a

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,250
lot of organizations where site builders

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,540
are coming in and you're people building

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,040
the same form over and over again to

00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:58,309
have a template that they can copy can

00:20:52,040 --> 00:21:00,200
really help so this is I'm good on time

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,910
and this is the longest demo we're going

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,740
to have because there's a lot of the

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:09,730
gamin I'm in the template section I'm

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,730
going to jump back over

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,600
for one second so just start off I

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,429
definitely have a kitchen sink you so

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,070
this is actually automatically generated

00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,600
off of every helmet that's available it

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,799
shows you every element I'm even

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,929
including some of the enhancements in

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,279
this example just to show you that you

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,529
can start scrolling through and seeing

00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,360
what your capabilities are you starting

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,010
to see basic elements there is support

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,740
for all multiple value elements so you

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:38,220
can add multiple text field including

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,169
html5 you get into variations of email I

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,330
actually have a comma delimited email

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,159
field because I needed that for the

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,720
webform API and now you're starting to

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,070
get into some JavaScript elements where

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,250
there's a rating element included a

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,140
signature element I really like this

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,090
this is just a telephone field with

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,950
enhanced to support international phone

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,480
numbers what I feel from a user

00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,890
experience is it tells your users you

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,659
get that they're international and it

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,909
actually does amazing validation on

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,559
these numbers and then I'm kind of

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,990
covering some other just elements if

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,100
people are starting to use more and more

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,260
toggle elements and then with file

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,760
uploads I did break them down and you

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,830
have a global file upload element that

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,020
you can use but you can do media type

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,549
specific file uploads it's specific for

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,279
mobile because when you use these and

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,720
you set a video media type when so it's

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,520
on a mobile device it opens up the video

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,049
recorder so for certain use cases it

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,149
made perfect sense to have that feature

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,380
and what's great about Drupal is this

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,820
isn't a lot of code to do all these

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,590
elements but I have a base element and

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm just extending to support media

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:39,570
types and now we're getting into this is

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,049
actually included in core jQuery UI has

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,640
a buttons element and every single

00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,200
option element I'm trying to support

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,700
other values so you can go in and out

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,730
others and I even added these cute

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,440
kitten which I'm gonna I did it not

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,240
knowing if people are going to use it

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,250
but I also as to challenge the API to

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
start adding some metadata to select

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,570
links which I'm going to show right at

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,549
the end this and then every element

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,470
every for mountain core I'm trying to

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,450
expose that's definitely one of my goals

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,130
and then so you got all the data

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,929
elements and then we get down to entity

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,750
references and you can actually expose

00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:15,990
your entity references and track them

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:19,139
and now Ted Bowman helped me work on

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,460
this really cool feature so we have

00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,440
quick edit working and we have

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,010
outside-in working I'm not demoing and

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,780
experiments

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,430
and the presentation so what would

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,840
happen right now if I had outside in

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,420
module which is experimental enabled

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,950
this would be an aside one but this just

00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,780
gives you a quick way to manage your

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,040
elements on the front end sometimes it's

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,600
nice just to be able to change the label

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,240
I'm using it's really helpful for the

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:44,550
demo because I can go down and show you

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,950
the cute kitten element which is right

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,390
here

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,340
so one of the reason I'm showing it is

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,320
what I really am happy about this

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,660
element is what it is is it's a Select

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,220
menu so that image the cute kittens it's

00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,680
just a select menu that's enhanced with

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,600
some JavaScript but in the API I'm able

00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,610
to add submit like basic I'm adding a

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,050
source image to it and I also was able

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,580
to get high into you to integrate and

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,110
this is going to open a new tab it

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,260
usually opens a Dalek so you can embed

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,880
images and what I want to emphasize is

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,930
this com opens up is this huge

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,000
possibility where you can start doing

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,160
quizzes and scoring because you can add

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,420
metadata to your options and I haven't

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,790
started building out these elements but

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,720
it it opens up these possibilities of

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:27,770
building much richer applications

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,770
moving on to composites

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,549
composites are just like an address

00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:40,529
field of our elements to work together

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:42,149
right now it's all programmatically

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,859
after it's very easy to write your own

00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,899
composites but I haven't built a UI for

00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,249
it it's actually a lot of work I think

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,259
it's more work right now than I have

00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,399
time for but you just start to get the

00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,350
patterns where you can do multiple

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,029
addresses very useful for event

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,090
registrations and I'm doing user

00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,350
profiles and I've experiment with some

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,330
credit-card fields and there is full

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,789
Likert support so there's all the Likert

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,700
options that you could you could imagine

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,289
I even did some geolocation so this is

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,970
picking up this is you so you can

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,739
actually hide this and have forms track

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,159
where they're being submitted from I'm

00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:15,149
using geolocation what else yeah and

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,070
then you can see there's an advanced

00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:19,549
telephone number what I want to demo

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:24,210
here is just to show you the UI because

00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:25,919
it's very flexible so you can set

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,269
default values sometimes I still use

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,279
yamo because sometimes it's just easier

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,539
than building out a whole UI for this

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,549
and most people aren't going to do

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,350
default values but you're able to

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,909
control each element hide and show these

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,859
composite elements so it gives you a lot

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,619
you to do even have some flexibility in

00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:44,480
here to even tweak how the state and

00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,480
provinces are working

00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,139
now this will speed up because these are

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:53,309
smaller demos work I just have examples

00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:54,870
of conditional objects like people need

00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:56,610
to understand how it's working they can

00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,809
go in and click on these elements and

00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,200
see how they're set up to do these

00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:02,909
different behaviors and these are very

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,139
helpful sometimes if we run into bugs we

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,840
can look at the examples and kind of

00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:08,789
duplicate them it put masks another

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,350
similar very simple is implement a

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:12,169
support I just wanted to show all the

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,279
possible input masks that you could use

00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:16,590
now we're getting is some interesting

00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,929
layout sup and there's two examples of

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,519
lands this is what's included in core so

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:22,289
this is just how status messages are

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,509
available and you can you can set

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:27,120
whether they're dismissible to bring up

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,980
you can say how that's stored so it

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,259
could be for the entire site it could be

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,389
for the user permanently it could be in

00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,309
their local session it could you have

00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:37,259
full control over how that's dismissing

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:38,610
and then you can even this is by the way

00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,990
this is just what core does you can

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,220
actually wrap elements and error

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,519
messages if you need to

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,070
I did add support for multi column

00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,899
options and checkboxes and once we're

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,299
back into core here this is just cores

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,830
form API supports adjusting where the

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,529
title is displayed and you actually as a

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,000
themer can have control over that i did

00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,610
add tooltip support but once again this

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,830
is cores jquery UI 2 type module with

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,269
three lines of code and you can go

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,980
customize it and tables are even

00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:07,159
supported if you need really complex

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,690
forms this is a custom table of gulp

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,850
that you're embedding elements into and

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,200
i did add support for multi-column

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,240
layout using flexbox which is a

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,480
completely supported technology so this

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,740
is css3 ie9 which is now irrelevant is

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,679
the only one that doesn't this doesn't

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,649
work with it's completely responsive so

00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,690
as you resize it'll collapse which nice

00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:29,129
is its CSS there's not a lot of code

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,870
going on here so you can actually go in

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,460
and customize it you could even probably

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,309
override and put your own grid framework

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,730
if you needed to and finally I think

00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:40,409
everyone is very needs their wizards and

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,450
this is an example of a wizard and you

00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,429
can go through and just look at and see

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,929
how it's set up I did add some custom

00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,820
behaviors so when I back up you're going

00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:49,259
to start seeing some behavior that's

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,940
saying you're about to lose your data

00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:54,320
and this is a setting this is not bound

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,320
by default you have to check it off

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,370
moving on to templates templates are

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,900
just these forms these elements being

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,580
brought together in some sense to give

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,410
you an example just what you could do so

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,690
there's an example of a donation

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,070
template it's not working fully the

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,000
payment system is not working there's a

00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,110
job application template and it's

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,250
important to say the way the templates

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,800
work is let's say I did the job

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,480
application I hit select this is a copy

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,700
so there's no reference to the original

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,040
template so your users can go up and do

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,230
whatever they want to this form now and

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,400
what I also want to point out is I need

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,440
help with the templates we can actually

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,690
keep altering them and improving them

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,580
and add adding more logic or text or

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,080
addressing different use cases is

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,770
perfectly fine it won't affect people

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,230
with existing installs finally with the

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,150
demos this is the last little piece to

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,280
it there's two demos

00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,290
I'm only I only have one enabled I did a

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,330
demo of an application evaluation system

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,980
and as I walk through your search suit

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,740
it's a very simple application so much

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,809
is filling in some information I put the

00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,960
demo installed and actually add some

00:28:54,809 --> 00:29:01,380
results and what you're going to see is

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,970
I click through and there's two forms to

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,980
this demo there's an application and an

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,170
evaluation and finally in the

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,300
configuration there's a block that lays

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,390
this application evaluation at the

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,890
bottom of each application and allows

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,110
you to build a system where you can put

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,160
comments in and save it and you can have

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,840
someone do reviews of different

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,400
submissions and they can navigate

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,480
through and I actually have sufficiently

00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,330
that's turned on where they can only do

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,920
one evaluation per submission it opens

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,720
up a whole review process and this is

00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:33,240
just the beginning of what I'm seeing as

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,530
the possibilities and moving on so I

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,210
think you start to see what can you

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,740
build with the module well you can it

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,480
allows you to build applications and

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,470
this is a list of what I've kind of come

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,640
up with and some of these that I've

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,200
started working on where you can do

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,390
college applicant that to me is like the

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,760
biggest challenge I want to see a you

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,470
know twenty form college application

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,660
being built in the web form up and get

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,860
it working I think job applications

00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,540
employ valuation people are familiar

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,150
with that event registration systems

00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,740
that's the other demo where you can set

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,620
up event and have web forms attached to

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,020
them and track that and you can do other

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,610
registrations online donations I've seen

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,650
a lot of for one offs especially if

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,010
you're integrating with a third

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,930
I used it for appointments could I do a

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,840
lot of medical stuff and you can even

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,190
have user profiles going at you like the

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,750
example if user profiles if you have a

00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,010
massive user profile you don't want to

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,750
put it into droop or you want to feed

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,070
into a CRM you could use the webform

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,800
Allah to do that and some people are

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,480
starting to write handlers to take that

00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,550
very complex profile and still create a

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,010
tuple user account with a few few of the

00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:34,580
elements and you know I'm going to get

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:36,050
more to that as I move on so to set up

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,760
these down really comes down to how you

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,150
publish these forms and web forms can be

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,380
just fully integrated into your site

00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,120
there's a web form node module so you

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,340
can actually take your so web forms are

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,660
now completely very usable there you

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,490
create your web form over here and then

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,230
you can embed it throughout your site so

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,730
the web part no module makes it easy for

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,290
you to have your contact form and then

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,500
embed it in different areas of your site

00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:00,350
announcer in a second and then you also

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,910
can just do the traditional blocks and

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,170
to backtrack one second what looks good

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,490
about the web form no mods when you're

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,930
choosing a field there's a web form

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,190
field and I have seen people starting to

00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,800
use it with paragraphs so you can

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,780
actually just embed web forms anywhere

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,660
that you have fields entities that take

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,570
field and I think by having that option

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,280
and the block option what you can do is

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,140
you can embed a web form there's a web

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,000
form block you can start use that for

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,560
things like panels and get your web

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,460
forms and bedroom panels on your site

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,940
then finally there is an API to really

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,040
easily embed a web form it is literally

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,630
pound typed in his web form web form ID

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,580
and you enter it and you could add some

00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,080
default data and settings and in any

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,670
render array that you're building you

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,310
can add a form to your site so it kind

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,530
of opens up anytime you need to get a

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,580
form somewhere you can do it with the

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,580
web form node module

00:31:52,999 --> 00:32:01,590
do contact you do get these settings you

00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:02,940
can set open and close you can you can

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,739
push some default submission there is

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,509
full token integration so you get some

00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:08,070
interesting nuances like if you really

00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,809
want to get complex you can start

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,970
altering the behaviors of this form you

00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:14,519
can set up a field for custom in the

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:16,139
custom confirmation message or an event

00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,230
you can kind of pass the event date

00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:20,909
through to the webform that's attached

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,710
this is going to keep evolving I'm

00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,019
hoping you know to make it as robust as

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,179
possible but you can also schedule each

00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,840
form but for now I'm just going to hit

00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:32,940
save I'm going to see the form and what

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,590
this does is enables a test and results

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,029
at night and quick edit is still working

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,350
here but most the time you're going to

00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,359
just want to test your form and I'm

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,159
going to do a test submission because it

00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,749
also is going to just introduce you to a

00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,419
really important concept so I've done

00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,710
one submission on this node I'm only

00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,850
going to see one submission but I want

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,100
to emphasize that I did a submission

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,869
before the other contact form and what

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,580
this starts to show you is each nodes

00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:56,519
tracking its own submissions I call it a

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,440
source entity so I've created this Dedic

00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,450
there's a dedicated instance where this

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,399
is collecting data for justice node

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,239
works really well to event registrations

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,830
because you could have an event

00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:06,239
registration form and have multiple

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,070
events throughout your site use the same

00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:12,570
registration form over and over again

00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:13,950
and we'll track that and to further

00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:21,320
emphasize that I'm going to do a block

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:21,320
and what what's cool about this sorry

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm going to do the same block of the

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,540
zoo contact I change anything and yes

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,670
you can pass the poll settings and a bit

00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,110
on the site and now I'm going to start

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:44,040
navigating some nodes and you can see it

00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:51,270
over here a little differently so up to

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:56,059
for submission I'm going to jump up to

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:58,559
the main forum and you're gonna see

00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:00,690
sorry I actually just want to throw out

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,429
I mean I jump to there is a tracking of

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,140
all results coming in so this page shows

00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:06,540
you every single submission coming

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,770
through when I only want to show you the

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,720
contact form because it's going to show

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,040
you the four different submissions and

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,020
what kind of just happened when I place

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,310
that block that contact bothell that it

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,389
became a feedback block which it's

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,850
actually tracking where people are

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,320
submitting the contact form from so it

00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,820
opens up this whole other possibility

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,110
where you're tracking the feedback on

00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,240
the sides in particular feedback it's

00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,010
almost like a mini comment system is

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,320
being created I don't recommend using

00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,429
webform for comments but once you start

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,909
understanding this feature kind of

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,310
unlocks

00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,590
a whole bunch of array of possibilities

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,770
that you could do with it

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,940
so moving on like it gets to now okay

00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,260
we're getting tonight what can you do

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,389
with these submissions the data that's

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,639
coming through well the web pommade

00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,960
revise an API to download and/or handle

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,580
submission confirmations and

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:54,600
notifications to any system so to demo

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,429
that before exam look so if we're all

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,350
familiar with the email sending emails

00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,820
it's called a webform handler and this

00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,980
is just an extensible plugin that you

00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,330
can handle your submissions and you can

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,010
route them to any system and the

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,960
specific one that's come up is remote

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,880
posting this data to other systems

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,470
specifically I think CRN's is the big

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,940
one where you might want to take a

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,410
little piece of this form submission and

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,060
push it into your CRM or push the whole

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,100
thing in and still the traditional

00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,570
method I think is really important use

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,760
cases being able just download all your

00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,100
submissions as a CSV just so yeah Moe

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,680
and more because that's also a plugin

00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,820
there's an exporter plugin so you can do

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,670
whatever you really want

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,590
it let me show it to you and so we're on

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,090
the results tab I'm going to jump up to

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,470
show you the handler first before we

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,990
look at the results so we're still on

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,700
the contact form this is I have a

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,340
confirmation notification I'm just going

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,470
to show you the form it's pretty easy to

00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,090
use but it does include every possible

00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,450
setting do we need for email so it's B

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:52,170
cccc you can set up there even is the

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,250
more complex stuff of reply to return

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,140
path

00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,490
this is sorting by the way to hint at

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,860
some of the conditional logic that's

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,510
supported by emails because by being

00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,560
able to send emails at different states

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,150
it opens up some interesting

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,700
possibilities where if someone saves a

00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,800
draft you might want an HR person to

00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,690
know that they save the draft or if

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,450
someone logs in and convert sir it just

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,450
it opens one of the use cases was for

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,890
the update process is in the application

00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:19,860
evaluation system they get the

00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:22,110
submission in and they want to a market

00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,610
as needs review and that's an update and

00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,260
then they have a conditional logic to

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,850
say well needs review sending email to

00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,490
all reviewers to get the review process

00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:32,550
done so this is just an easy way to kind

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,110
of route decide when the email should be

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,520
sent and there is a debug handler that

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,040
will show you when emails are being sent

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:43,440
and tracking what I want to download is

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:45,360
the remote close handler I'm going to

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,400
use my broken CRM link here because I

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,160
think that's a good starting point and

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,800
this does support posting to different

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,940
URLs for insert update and delete you

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
can control the submission data by

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,750
default I'm only sending the submission

00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,660
data and not the metadata it felt like a

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,790
more sensible default basically what

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,680
they submitted and you can add custom

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,170
data now what this starts to hint at is

00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,120
you could add API keys to this request I

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,350
also want to emphasize this is a plugin

00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,030
that can be extended so if you have

00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,440
whole wealth authentication so I'm

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,300
hoping so I'm going to write an OAuth

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,300
remote post plug-in and get some sort of

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,410
generic integration working moving on I

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:27,480
hit test and this is going to be broken

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:29,930
but what what I like about I do not turn

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,970
on the debug

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,500
it's broken and that's why by the way I

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,210
recommend anyone writing handlers to

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:42,420
include debug options because what it

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:43,770
does is you to write able to debug

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,050
things and see what's going on and the

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,180
post failed that's telling us exactly

00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,980
what happened shows you the data which i

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,260
think is cool to see how simple the data

00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,970
is going in and out a little technical

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,160
note I'm not using the tree property on

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,950
forms it's very flat I have to enter a

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,240
unique key for every single element it's

00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,800
a pain in the neck when you're building

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,600
foreign so when you start doing API

00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,550
integration you know exactly what the

00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,880
names of your helmets are and just

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:11,340
showing you the data and how it's broken

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,780
moving on to the more traditional aspect

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:17,130
of it is if we go to the results tab

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,520
download is basically what people are

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,500
familiar with I do not have full Excel

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,090
support working because I have an

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,670
ambitious hope that I will get all

00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,230
relate like real Excel support where all

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,310
the relationships will be included in

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,750
your spreadsheet you have multiple

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,160
sheets so it'll break it'll really

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,230
include all the data that you're

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,820
collecting but for now there's this HTML

00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,190
table support which you can check off

00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,270
and it will open in Excel and if I

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,010
uncheck this little option you'll see

00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,050
it'll open this table in Excel and show

00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,270
you all the data that's coming in you

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,550
have control over how the columns are

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:53,100
set up what values the formatting of

00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:54,510
each value so moving on so this is

00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,920
starting to hit the remote post art

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,940
saying you can front-end any back-end

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,190
this is something I'm been pushing for

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,960
you can actually have a web form never

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,790
hit Drupal this is a kind of a new

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,440
concept but it's like use Drupal to

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,700
build a form but if you if you have a

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,310
form in these collects a million

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,540
submissions don't have to pull

00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,950
bootstrapping and loading so you can

00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,750
actually go in and change the action

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,640
property of a form and route this data

00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,780
to a totally different server now you do

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,220
have to set the server to do some

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,350
validation but it opens up a whole other

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,570
popular Drupal it's do just building a

00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:27,360
form you can have it go to a very

00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,860
powerful node.js back-end and it just

00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,080
starts to lead into like what can you

00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,820
customize with the web form module well

00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,870
I want to emphasize it ships with

00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,520
reasonably small it's something I'm

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,710
almost passionate about like things

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,450
should work and not you don't have to

00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,080
hate fussing the things I hate fussing

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,510
with my life

00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,130
I wanted to just work and then if I need

00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:47,880
to fix something or tweak something it's

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:50,010
easy to do and so every single message

00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,610
is customizable every single setting is

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,930
customizable I'm going to show you some

00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,490
stuff and it's like someone put an issue

00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,840
in my queue and I'm going to bring it up

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:02,310
because go to the forum and edit it it

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,480
does start to get a little overwhelming

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,310
so there's two features here where you

00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,140
can expand on collapse all details and

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,480
actually remembers the state of these

00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,730
details I'm going to expand all and talk

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,500
and walk through some of these but you

00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,510
start to see you can just say you can't

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,040
disabled results once it's been saved

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:22,080
but you can disable results for new

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,580
forms you set up custom URLs pass you

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
get into the opening closing every

00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,850
message is customizable and there is a

00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,470
default global message that you can

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,510
customize for all your forms and it will

00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:33,330
propagate through for it like every

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,160
setting supports that feature when you

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,810
get to something like a submit button or

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,090
anything that could have attributes you

00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,540
have full control over what's going on

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,700
which includes the label CSS classes CSS

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,340
styles and even injecting custom

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,840
properties into the into each element

00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,400
what the benefit here is you could do

00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,380
some interesting stuff with like tagging

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,450
adding data attributes if you're

00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,430
starting to do heavy analytics it opens

00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,290
up that possibility and then you have

00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,760
this I'm trying to do every behavior

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,230
that I could possibly think of I like

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,720
the auto focus if you have a form that

00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,830
someone's submitting millions of times

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,520
focusing them on the first element with

00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,150
the for mode

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,490
saves and we click and you can do

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,810
pre-populating and I'm doing some

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,340
nuances with back button system

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,930
preventing duplicate submissions it's

00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,000
just a JavaScript someone can't click

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,410
the submit twice you're seeing this

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,080
pattern this pattern this is actually a

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,940
dedicated element that just lets you set

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,860
attributes on any element that you can

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,280
imagine so every time you see a button

00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,450
you're going to see this option and we

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,230
have the full support for wizard

00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:35,460
progress bar preview what I turn on

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,140
someone just files a ticket because I

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,510
missed something where you can't it's

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,980
when you do a preview it says the button

00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,090
says preview and the title says preview

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,590
and they're asking what can't you

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,600
customize that I think the answer is yes

00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,460
you should be able to say well review

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,710
your application instead of preview or

00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,730
whatever you might want to change it to

00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,380
so that's going to be a setting that

00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,250
will be added in and you do have control

00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,930
the preview message

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,880
drats this is that feature with the

00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:01,890
anonymous and authenticated drafts and

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,420
it does this is so I have exposed this

00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,130
in my message to everyone to build their

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,990
folks I use this stuff actively in my

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,250
API and within the web for modular this

00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,900
is just an inline message with

00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,790
conditional logic wrapped around to kind

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,230
of recommend turn on automatic drafts

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,980
the automatic purging moving on

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,170
submission behaviors

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,840
you know confidential submissions the

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,460
converting anonymous submissions to

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,460
authenticated that's ascending you have

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,680
to turn on hard to make those decisions

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,630
that important to say the WebP Ahmad was

00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,040
in beta so these some of these can

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,540
change if we really feel the venture

00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,340
beautiful I didn't do it as people are

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,630
familiar than Drupal seven you're not

00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,330
doing that so I didn't want to surprise

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,710
people submission limits their full

00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,910
support for submission limits are going

00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,250
to be some more improvements because

00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,100
there is total submission limits User

00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,360
Submission limit and entity specific

00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,070
submission limit so if you have a

00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,930
webform node you could say I only want

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,430
ten submissions to go you can't control

00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,340
a per node but I would like to get that

00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,920
working at some point confirmations for

00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,480
whatever you want for confirmation I

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,390
concluded every option I could possibly

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,970
dream of down to inline messages and

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,110
redirects um you can set up ownership to

00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,980
these forms even though they're config

00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,180
entities it makes a big difference

00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,950
because then you can have someone on the

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,930
forum and sub access controls and this

00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,220
is actually the remote post it's not the

00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,590
real quotes but this idea that you could

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,330
decouple the form completely because you

00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,190
could set post through custom server and

00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,770
set it to a nodejs server and the data

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,650
be posted someone actually use this the

00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:29,100
get method to take a webform and make it

00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,840
they had a very complex exposed view

00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,580
filter where they have hundreds of off

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,050
like dozens of options and they needed a

00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,350
block that just called out two or three

00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,360
they built a webform it just submits to

00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,770
the view and so it I actually did a

00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,420
screencast on because it's a really cool

00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:46,710
implementation and just showed a very

00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,310
simple way to organize your forms on my

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:51,740
own time if you go

00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,390
so how do you extend the module I'm not

00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,730
going to get into code but I think or

00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,370
what's what is really important to say

00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:02,480
okay so web forms are configured is they

00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,860
are exportable it's it's important to

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,780
know that when you're building your site

00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,000
if you're doing bulk config imports and

00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,680
exports you're going to have to work on

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,030
there's recommendations on how to handle

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,580
configure you don't want overwritten

00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,870
during an import process submissions are

00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,430
content entities they're completely

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,050
continuities I mean they're

00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,670
automatically exposed to views and what

00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,340
the webform views module is just

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,350
exposing the data that's a little the

00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,270
data is cost is storing the custom table

00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,310
is exposing that to views but it also

00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,230
opens up rules will start working with

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,000
submissions once that's that's happening

00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,860
and the stuff you're seeing with

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,170
elements handlers and experts that all

00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,870
plugins are all extendable they're well

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,280
documented and you can do that's what I

00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,610
feel like most developers can be working

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,170
on and everything that's you see coming

00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,210
out of this module is running through

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,920
the theme system there's you can almost

00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,650
you can alter almost everything between

00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,570
pre process functions and form alters

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,470
you can probably tweak anything you want

00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:59,060
with a form and I want to emphasize I

00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,620
almost I had slides to show test but

00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,090
there are a lot of tests if you're a

00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,400
developer and you turn on that test

00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,350
module you're going to see 120 forms

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,840
that isolate each individual nuance

00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,580
feature and shows how it work works and

00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,080
for me it helps debug things really

00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,050
quickly because someone follows an issue

00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,030
I can just go look at a working example

00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:21,250
of something grow something to figure

00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:24,320
out what's going on so so what's next

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,360
I brought views integration rules

00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:31,100
integration they're really really

00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,720
important things conditionals I strongly

00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,470
believe that server-side validation is

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,480
going to be really important um I wonder

00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,680
whether it should be in core as well

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,060
like the state's API needs to be

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,140
rethought a little bit so the core

00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,970
supports it because it's kind of an

00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,950
issue when anyone's using States API

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,470
they're not getting a server-side

00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:50,270
validation crossfades conditional logic

00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,680
that's going to have to go into the

00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:53,330
module so that when you're on one page

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,470
and someone submits a value you get to

00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,810
the next page you might want to hide or

00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,510
require certain fields I think someone's

00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,650
put a module together to do that

00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,390
templates I just feel templates help

00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,560
grow the

00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,180
unity to help people out when they're

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,760
getting started so I feel like that's

00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:09,250
going to be an endless task third party

00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,140
integration is really going to secure

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,760
the triple eco system when you do these

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,010
modules is the more people can

00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,930
contribute these integrations the more

00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,940
people get involved more flexible I I

00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,980
mean I think Google shoots personally I

00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,840
loved Google sheets tonight I would I

00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,900
need an integration I haven't gotten

00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,000
around to either researching it with the

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,500
user experience in UX there's definitely

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,790
a lot of cool stuff in it I'm now

00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,650
following along without sighted and

00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:34,510
that's hands down my decision especially

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,920
because I work with Ted on doing so the

00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,930
system tray is not working in the web

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,060
Bomont review turned online it works the

00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,740
user experience is really clean and I

00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,180
think core is going to have really nice

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,410
user experience improvements that the

00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,900
web hormones will just start leveraging

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,090
over and over again and finally this is

00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,400
big this is my big challenge for myself

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,530
and I've been working all year to get

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,160
some level field API integration there's

00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:59,350
a ticket on drupal.org it's hard to the

00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,670
web for muggle has its own separate way

00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,650
to store data because it's storing lots

00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,750
of data too technical throwing an entity

00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,310
attribute value tables or a flat simple

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,340
table so it allows it to hold a lot of

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,200
data but sometimes you want to get data

00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,910
into your entities in your fields and

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,350
there's got to be some I'm hoping

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,940
there's some grid some way where you

00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,440
submit a form and some of the day will

00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,660
go into an entity you will create an

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,900
entity it might update a user account

00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,000
and I've done little nuanced features to

00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,010
get how to put things in line where

00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,710
field API can integrate can happen but

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,720
this is an incredible amount of work I I

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:34,330
didn't even think I'd get close to being

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,830
able to say I could do it so it really

00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,750
starting to come to like how can we help

00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,970
the web pull module succeed well it's

00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,250
open source it's free we need to help it

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,320
grow like people need to start

00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:48,640
contributing it comes back to the site I

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,990
mean every every presentation is going

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,560
to have this slide because this is how

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,760
it will work

00:47:50,560 --> 00:48:00,370
people have to contribute to the

00:47:51,760 --> 00:48:02,470
community to make it happen oh sorry

00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,860
I love tracking something because I

00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:07,420
added some slides recently it's I'm

00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,890
going to argue that people should

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,480
sponsor a feature and I'm going to start

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,520
talking about in a second it's just a

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
content but it comes down to like how

00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,769
can I

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,859
you will maintain an important triple

00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:19,900
project which is created I think this is

00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:21,099
important that I feel in the contribs

00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,259
base people have to take some ownership

00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:24,839
of certain modules and push them fo and

00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:28,749
say I own this I'm going to do it

00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:31,029
because it helps push people forward

00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:32,049
someone needs to have that de literally

00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:34,150
need to get behind it and push it

00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:35,559
forward and becomes a huge amount of

00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:37,299
work and it's overwhelmed a lot of

00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,130
people I think it overwhelmed your

00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,329
people in the people selling webform

00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,180
space because it was like an impossible

00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:47,170
task and I'm kind of coming up with this

00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:50,200
concept that we need to figure out how

00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,490
to support modules and this is I've

00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,499
dabbled with well you can have a

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:56,170
donation form I got rid of that I'm not

00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:58,180
asking for donations I'm asking for

00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,880
people to work with me to build this

00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:03,309
module and do it in a very transparent

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,950
way publicly on walk through these steps

00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:07,359
because it's like publicly on drupal.org

00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,950
if someone has a feature and you need

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,529
something let's do it on drupal.org

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,599
right the is you describe the problem to

00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:14,890
find the solution I highlighted these

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,960
two things because these are the two

00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,910
challenges you estimate the amount of

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,130
work because the Troopa community is

00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:23,200
petrified of doing this publicly in the

00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:25,839
drupal issue cube because we're still in

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,579
the what is it it's ready when it's

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,920
ready or you just like you don't want to

00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:30,970
commit to anything but it I think it's

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,289
hurting people because they don't know

00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,059
what's really going on I mean people

00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:35,499
file issues and I would like to be able

00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:36,910
to say this is an incredible amount of

00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:39,339
work I would like to put story points at

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,420
104 field API so they get it instead of

00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:42,640
when they start commenting about when

00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,319
are you going to have this ready but

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,849
once we start getting an estimate to the

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,200
amount of work you can work with people

00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:49,390
in the community I'm looking for people

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,190
to work with me to get an agreement

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,140
together just and the agreement is

00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,670
incredibly simple I've done it I'm going

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,499
to show you who I did it with the

00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,529
agreement to work for hire with an

00:49:56,499 --> 00:50:01,269
open-source clause attached to it it's

00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:05,019
not going to be that hard to figure this

00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:07,210
out and once we get this agreement done

00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:08,170
we just build a feature we share the

00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,239
feature of the community and then we

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,289
maintain it like part of what I'm

00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,489
looking for is maintaining these

00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:14,079
features I have no problem with it

00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:19,420
build it maintain it and repeat this

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:20,920
process I think this is important the

00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,480
Drupal kamini to figure out how to

00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,190
support the contrabass support modules

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,210
and I worked with cancer estate and

00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,670
these are the four tickets they

00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,480
sponsored and the process was these four

00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:36,369
tickets for my project proposal period

00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,190
we sat down on drupal.org wrote these

00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,510
tickets out documented them and one

00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,430
funny thing about for me

00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,799
what I personally loved about this

00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:46,269
potential in this process is you could

00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:48,010
work with me we could write the ticket

00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:49,119
and we could not do the project and I

00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,180
won't be upset at all

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,380
because we did work that's public

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,960
reusable other people might come in and

00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,359
use it and personally I hate those RFPs

00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,769
that I spent you know five hours writing

00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:01,480
that go into the garbage because we

00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:03,579
couldn't agree on it you know of redoing

00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,839
the work and so they spotted to these

00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:06,460
feature and these are huge features I

00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,799
mean the scheduled email handler is an

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,589
amazingly cool feature because it opens

00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:13,000
up two possibilities you can remind

00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:15,039
people of a draft you can remind people

00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,029
you can have reminders sent out before

00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:26,740
an event ran out my water so moving on

00:51:21,029 --> 00:51:30,190
how I hope you with the web home budget

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:32,529
well I can help your training support

00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:34,509
contribute sponsor features really what

00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:36,609
I'm talking about and I am open to doing

00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:39,609
any Drupal 8 project and you can kind of

00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:44,099
catch rate j-rok let's calm drupal.org

00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:49,079
day rockets brow my dog to thank and

00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:49,079
there is a box tomorrow thanks

00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,280
so there's 8 minutes left I feel

00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:03,420
fortunate its before lunch so questions

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,860
are welcome there is a mic I'm going to

00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,230
let people you ever goes the mic I'm

00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,430
gonna do it to find people yeah so

00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,150
they're recorded I think that's very

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,550
important

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,710
alright so I had two questions first of

00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:20,190
all do you ever sleep and second of all

00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:22,290
what is the migration path for content

00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:27,090
out of four forms and data coming from

00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:31,050
d7 into d8 um I work from home and I had

00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:36,060
a really interesting sleeping pattern I

00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:38,100
I uh I don't know I I mean by the way I

00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,600
put a lot of energy this and like I had

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,580
to go to my wife and I'm coming home and

00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,930
changing things like I'm going to it's

00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,000
not slowing down but figuring out the

00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,410
right patterns and balance but I really

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,360
for this conference I've tried my best

00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,580
to get as much done as possible and I'm

00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,530
trying to I'm really trying to be a

00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,510
hundred percent in and not hold anything

00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:57,240
back but I'm reaching that point where

00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:59,490
it's not possible yeah so with and with

00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,920
a migration path someone's going to have

00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,870
to write a migration path like a deep

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,030
like a traditional truthful migration

00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:10,980
path I think that's one approach for me

00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:14,190
I'm not I mean the other one that might

00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,380
need to happen is someone writes a CSV

00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,240
import and export so you could get your

00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,070
data out of seven and import that way

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,660
there's also with forms I do to Mike I

00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,300
did a custom migration web form sea

00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,250
animal forms I need to emphasize this is

00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,040
a render array so if you have a what a

00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,630
form that's not even in web forms and

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,400
you need to migrate it into web forms

00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,350
you can actually serialize that render

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,630
array into llamo and you've got a form

00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,910
and it works like it works out of the

00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:42,510
box like the wiring so I think there's a

00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,530
lot of possibilities I feel like there's

00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,000
a lot of projects out there there

00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,400
someone's going to do the migration it's

00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,070
inevitable and one problem is there's a

00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,900
lot of new features so that's going to

00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:54,240
there's not too much missing which is a

00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:59,250
good thing to setting' hope that answers

00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,860
it hi first very impressive you know the

00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,690
what-for model is amazing I have a

00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,740
feature request I can broadly posture is

00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,470
including a hierarchical silat

00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,270
one of your field a word hierarchical

00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:13,750
silat like I just feel like like a

00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:15,430
country city that kind of oh we like it

00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,590
one of the fields yes

00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:20,850
hierarchical celeb sorry about my accent

00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:25,300
the second question I have is about

00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:27,490
summations like a workflow process for

00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,910
summations so that's something we need a

00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:33,370
lot like it after a user submits the

00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,740
form they have to ask you a moderation

00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,870
process yeah so we need to implement

00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:41,050
that somehow so I don't know if you have

00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:42,490
plans for workflow integration I am well

00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:45,460
it's important like I don't want to

00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:47,320
totally conflict with the web for

00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,790
modular form builder and then like cores

00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,500
got its own workflow initiative and

00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,450
there might in certain use cases you

00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,420
should leverage that workflow initiative

00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:57,880
completely especially I mean I don't see

00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,610
ever getting revision tracking into the

00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,040
web for model it's just like overkill um

00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:04,240
that but to address it like the Kanto

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,600
state they're definitely doing that

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,760
there's a conditional Handler like I'll

00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,860
just show to you the quickest demo is

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,460
why I have these templates by the ways I

00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,690
can say feedback select I've just copied

00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,080
the feedback temple which is just

00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:25,260
showing you example then if I go in here

00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:27,970
and I hit notification this is driving

00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,620
like basically routing email to a

00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,850
specific email address and what someone

00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,920
what they're doing in this application

00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:34,900
process is they've set up a work flow

00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,130
field in the webform module that has

00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,720
access controls on it so the person

00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,820
submitting the form never sees the field

00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,740
but the administrator who comes in and

00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,540
starts the review process starts

00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,060
tweaking that field and changing the

00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,340
value and start routing emails to

00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,140
different users and they get to evaluate

00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,310
different field so this user comes in

00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,290
who's your reviewer they get a field

00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:55,300
that says do you like this person they

00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:58,450
review the person who are able to build

00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,650
some custom workflows to it and I also

00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,880
wanted to throw out there that's kind of

00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,350
why these other integrations are

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,180
possible because sometimes you just put

00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,410
it in your CRM I mean I just gotta be

00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:10,170
honest like some data should just go

00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:10,170
into a fully robust system with tracking

00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:21,270
hi I I wonder if you could talk a little

00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:27,150
bit more about customizing the Thank You

00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:30,720
pages based on what's in the forum

00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:32,220
results well okay you're getting two

00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,230
routes juicy um

00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,780
there's little token support so that's

00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:38,220
really helpful in many many ways because

00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,470
you can pass token so you could have

00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,200
custom fields on your form you can pass

00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:45,780
the data through everything is

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,770
supporting tokens I mean just to kind of

00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,650
address the question so we're just

00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:54,480
showing it is well let's look at it by

00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,800
the way this page will keep getting

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,120
improved but that's why there's this

00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,000
class at the top because it's the only

00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,930
way I can get two things one of the

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,640
challenges is saying I'm going to

00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,680
include every setting so yeah you have

00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,500
the full HTML you can inject yeah you

00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,720
can inject tokens into here and it's a

00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,180
dedicated template the confirmation page

00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,490
so you can override that and get into

00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,970
any type of value you want in there it's

00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:23,340
like it's called webform - confirmation

00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:26,160
okay thank you for post submission

00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:30,300
processing like sending the form data on

00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:34,170
to a CRM like Salesforce is there a way

00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:36,990
to map each field to a field name that

00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:41,250
the the place you're sending it is

00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:43,860
expecting yes but it's not built in if

00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,780
um there's a mapping element so I'm

00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,400
doing a lot of API so what you just saw

00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,690
that confirmation that email we're

00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,320
showing how you're doing the routing

00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:53,520
there's a dedicated mapping element I

00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,170
have it there's you'd have to implement

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,640
the custom mapping yourself you have to

00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,040
write a plug-in that implements this

00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,960
mapping element and the truth is the

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,640
mapping element there's if you get into

00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,260
the test and start navigating around and

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,880
looking for mapping there's actually

00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,420
experimental mapping element to do field

00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,500
API integration so it's the idea that

00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,360
you're looking at the form and you can

00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,300
see all the elements and then it maps to

00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,520
whatever entity and you want to route to

00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,480
but the prop the challenge is writing

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,770
the logic and also making sure work

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,090
like getting the date to go in the right

00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,420
field and make sure it doesn't break

00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,420
things

00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:37,200
hi this looks absolutely amazing I am

00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:39,800
super impressed my question is what post

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,300
submission is there the ability to

00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,540
either after you've gone off and hit

00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:48,510
your external CRM or whatever or if

00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,890
taking the results the submission and

00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,010
doing some sort of calculation and then

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:55,200
storing whatever is returned back on the

00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:57,000
submission there's a ticket for that and

00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,860
I haven't totally wrapped my head around

00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,830
it I mean that's why the Logging's there

00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,150
to kind of do some tracking the the

00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,710
challenge is how do you store that I

00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,120
haven't really figured out wrap my head

00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,620
around how you store that data where

00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,290
you're storing that data it's securely

00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,400
storing it it's going to happen it's

00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:13,200
simple because I see that requirement

00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,670
coming in I mean I also saw in some

00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,830
other forms of the day at this concept

00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,090
that you would do your remote post and

00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,040
the remote post would return the

00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:22,110
confirmation page like literally give

00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,700
you the HTML markup for the confirmation

00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:26,250
page and I I thought that was a great

00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,920
solution the technical workaround for

00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:30,150
this is to use a session so you extend

00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,650
the handler and then you just take

00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,940
whatever results come in and you write

00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,260
it into a session variable and then when

00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:40,920
you get to the confirmation page is

00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:44,220
showing that data thanks for all your

00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,630
hard work really and and I think if you

00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:49,020
look at your module it's just it shows

00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:50,400
so much thoughtfulness and care and I

00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,280
think someday we great to hear from you

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,360
about the tenants of good module

00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,950
development because I think it's

00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,920
instructive for the rest of us out here

00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,360
who build modules you know on just sort

00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,980
of things to think about when you're

01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,150
approaching building a module so that

01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,230
would be really great to hear from you

01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:09,450
on another question on the part where

01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:12,150
you can stick a form on there and it

01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:14,670
automatically sort of gets an entity

01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,590
reference source a source entity came

01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:18,420
over it's it's it's not an entity

01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:22,290
reference right so it's a little tough

01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:25,590
to get to the entity data via views and

01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:28,470
I know that is that the views the web

01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:31,470
forum views modules issue or it's a web

01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,690
forum views module issue the it's also

01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,920
important for technically it's like

01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,599
I'm following all these patterns in

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,000
course the exact pattern of the source

01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,310
entity is almost direct from comments

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,530
because it's very tricky one of the

01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:44,930
challenges is this source and it could

01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,460
be anything so you can't very hard to do

01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:49,099
a very direct entity right it could be

01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:51,770
any entity on your site it's very hard

01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,869
to kind of trap all you can do is track

01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,910
the any type in any ID bring them

01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:57,470
together and create a values the web

01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,030
point views modules should be able to

01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:01,400
address it I have a feeling they'll look

01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,540
at they'll look at the comment module or

01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,740
figure out how they're addressing it in

01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,819
common the comment system okay thank you

01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:11,359
so Jacob

01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:13,970
so it's this more a testimonial than a

01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,740
question we've actually highly recommend

01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,930
this webform our company's big news in

01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:21,319
it for a little over three months now we

01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:24,440
just sent like around 30,000 users

01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:26,690
overnight and everything's been working

01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,619
well so thank you so much thank you and

01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:32,690
it's we have like the CRM Bay so we're

01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:38,930
not storing the data and roofilin it's

01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:41,359
working perfectly yeah no echo what a

01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,760
few other people of Sud is just I'm

01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,530
gonna have to go sit in a dark room for

01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,930
about an hour to be able to digest

01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:52,720
everything you went over and this yeah

01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:52,720
it's stunning I mean simply stunning

01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:04,140
what beyond the webform what I'm going

01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:06,259
to take away from this was what you

01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:10,019
talked about with the issue queue and

01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:16,200
with was Kennesaw State yes where you

01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:18,480
did your RFP by putting I'm not sure how

01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,940
to broadcast that to the community as a

01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,420
whole but that seems like a really

01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:27,450
powerful thought that would benefit the

01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:29,759
community in a huge way if you were able

01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:32,519
that I mean now putting more stuff on

01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:36,980
you but to share that and abroad because

01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:40,259
that's that is a really powerful and

01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:44,579
different idea that I've seen come

01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:46,410
around Drupal before so I'm not I am NOT

01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:49,140
a great blog post or writer and I'm not

01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,039
going to go evangelize it what I'm think

01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,450
people are seeing a pattern in the

01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:53,759
module where I'm just doing this I'm

01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:55,440
just going to try it and my one of my

01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:57,720
missions here's there's a few people who

01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,160
companies that remain unnamed that I

01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,200
need to corner and just getting to do it

01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,269
because the the key concept is we just

01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,039
got to do it people have to change their

01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:07,019
methodology when they plan a project to

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,430
be like X amount of dollars we're going

01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:11,099
to contribute to the community in this

01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:12,989
fashion I mean there is math was one of

01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:14,970
those approaches I think the problem was

01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,440
it didn't roll it didn't keep going it

01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:19,769
didn't figure out a sustainable system

01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,650
of hoping this could I mean I'm banking

01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:24,480
on it and also one personal note was

01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:26,579
fact the fact that Drupal has backwards

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,470
compatibility makes it significantly

01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:30,509
more worth my while to make this effort

01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,489
because I know this could have five

01:03:30,509 --> 01:03:34,589
years longevity five years from now I'm

01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:39,859
not going to be expected to put a year

01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:39,859
into rewriting a whole codebase thanks

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:51,920
more Q&A in the hallways

01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:55,810
[Applause]

01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,810
there's no problem here for questions

01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,800
