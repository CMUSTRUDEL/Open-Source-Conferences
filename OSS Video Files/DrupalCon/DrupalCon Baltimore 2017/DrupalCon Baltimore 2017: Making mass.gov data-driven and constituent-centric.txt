Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Making mass.gov data-driven and constituent-centric
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is reinventing our digital ecosystem. If we’re successful, mass.gov will be the “amazon.com” of government services in MA. Structured information will be provided by a diverse constellation of providers (government agencies). This content will be dynamically organized and reorganized to help users find what they need; zero knowledge of agencies, acronyms, or bureaucratic processes required. Everything is being reimagined as a path to a funnel to a “conversion". A conversion gets tracked when a constituent’s need is met or a service is delivered. At the center is a new, Drupal-based, mass.gov.

This session will share our approach and look under the hood of pilot.mass.gov in our ninth month of development at the end of April. In our first three months we stood up a proof-of-concept site. By six months we implemented our first round of improvements based on user testing and our data scientists launched an analytics dashboard to begin tracking and analyzing government service delivery as conversions. In April, new-and-improved content will be live and discoverable by Google, collecting real data and unguided user feedback; and we will be nearing the end of our push to refine authoring experience and scale content production.

Here’s a quick run down of data we’re grappling with and some of the tools and tech we’ll discuss in this session:

Data

As of 2016, 10% of mass.gov’s content serves 90% of our traffic. We can have a huge impact by focusing on this small fraction of high-value content!

76% of constituents interact with the government online. At 55% phone is a distant second. In-person and email are both under 40%. Constituents expectations are accelerating and technology is constantly changing. We need to catch up and keep up.

User research

Treejack’s “pie trees” are a delightful for visualizing information architecture tests.

Validately is a remote usability testing tool we’re using to help us recruit users and execute tests.

Tech

Drupal 8 for CMS behind mass.gov

Drupal 7 DKAN to power our document repository and provide embeddable data visualizations

Pattern Lab for CMS agnostic atomic design to promote consistent UX across a diverse technology ecosystem

Google Tag Manager for collecting web statistics

Shiny for visualizing our data scientists' R analyses in a dashboard that’s easy and intuitive for business stakeholders

AWS API Gateway to provide a unified facade for RESTful web services

We’re eager to share our experiences, learn from the Drupal community, and invite other government organizations to collaborate with us.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
and my clock says 2:15 so I'm gonna go

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:10,110
ahead and get started here my name is

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,790
Brian Hirsch my name is Brian Hirsch I'm

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,700
the product owner for mass gov at

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,230
Massachusetts digital services and I'm

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,880
here with Moshe Weitzman who is one of

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,410
our technical architects on the project

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,090
I think we have a bunch of digital

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,170
services people as well as Palantir and

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,449
Valier who can help us in the room so

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,910
I'm here to talk about our journey to

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,719
becoming a user centric data-driven

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,430
organization and before I get started I

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,380
just want to see a show of hands to get

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,079
a sense of who's in the room with us I

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,559
just see how many people here work for a

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,280
government agency Wow vendors

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,149
contractors for government projects and

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,360
anyone who does not do anything with

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:57,300
government ok great thank you doing here

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,789
um so we we want to be data-driven we

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,530
want to be constituent centric but this

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,510
is new territory for mass IT and we

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,369
haven't figured it all out it's

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,170
definitely still a work in progress but

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,670
here are some vignettes from our work

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,740
and hopefully some steps in the right

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,600
direction and some lessons learned and

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,090
code work sharing when Governor Baker

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,210
took office he identified IT as a

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,000
trouble spot agencies across the state

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,000
government echoed his concern and so his

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,340
administration hired McKinsey to give us

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,540
some advice here's a slide from the

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,799
report they gave us a year ago actually

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,360
Natalie started tonight trouble someone

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,360
to close door over here for the noise

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:43,070
thank you so here's a slide from

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Mackenzie's report one year ago 76% of

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,610
constituents interact with us online

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,460
that's way more than any other medium

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,259
phone in person thank you phone in

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,700
person mail on

00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,360
meanwhile user satisfaction is really

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,869
low on the right McKinsey scores math

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,500
gov McKinsey found among our users

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:10,009
mass.gov scored 32 in user satisfaction

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,099
that's 25% lower than the best state

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,160
which is Texas but Texas is not our

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,769
competition our competition is the

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,099
private sector websites that set our

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,810
constituents expectations for what

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,470
interacting with organizations online

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,340
should be like in 2017 and the best

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:35,090
state only scored half as good as

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:38,090
comparable private sector websites why

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,970
is satisfaction so low here a couple

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,769
examples to register a new business in

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,569
the state of Massachusetts in addition

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,209
to registering my business with the

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,250
federal government the IRS I need to

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,690
interact with three different state

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,549
entities the secretary of state the

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,190
departments of unemployment assistance

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,350
and the Department of Revenue three

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,569
different state websites if I want to

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,049
find tuition assistance information I

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:06,739
need to find my way to and through seven

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,410
different state government websites if I

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,329
do a search I'm searching two hundred

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,790
and fifty thousand different pages and

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,549
uploads on mass gov spread across three

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,730
hundred sub sites plus four hundred

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,380
other sites and mixed in with the

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,780
information about tuition assistance for

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,730
Massachusetts residents is information

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,889
about tuition assistance from the

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,930
federal government to local school

00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,959
districts who provide special education

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,840
for example if I find the content that

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm looking for too often that content

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,319
is confusing or frustrating or hard to

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,880
understand we want content to be easy to

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,980
understand we want our constituents

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,079
experience to be fast and easy and

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,910
wicked awesome

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,859
we don't want constituents have to

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,959
understand the structure of the

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,900
government bureaucracy to find the

00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,060
things that they need so fast easy

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,180
awesome this all sounds good right

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,190
so so where do we start so one thought

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,590
might be we redo our visual design

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,180
figure out how to reorganize our content

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,010
so it's easier to find rewrite some of

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,209
the things that are not anything to

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,350
understand let's say you know some posts

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,850
will take more time some will take less

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,989
let's say it averages out to about an

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,270
hour's worth of work per post of

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,760
unstructured content that we're

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:30,000
interacting with to rewrite with 250,000

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,910
unique URLs that has up to 7,000

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,820
business weeks worth of work that is a

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,570
paralyzing number there's no way we can

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,400
do that so after the McKinsey report the

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,640
governor brought new leadership to mass

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,440
IT and they formed digital services the

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,880
team that took over the mass.gov project

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
right as it was about to kick off and

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,790
they gave us two

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,460
focusing requirements to jumpstart the

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,360
project the first one was start at the

00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,660
top there's this tried-and-true

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,979
management rule called the 80/20 rule in

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,669
economics it's called the Pareto

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:09,240
principle and the idea is 20% of the

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,870
content probably generates 80% or more

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,910
of the value so they instructed us to go

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,970
study our data and figure out what the

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,320
top 20 is we were skeptical but here's

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,580
what our data scientists were able to

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:27,560
figure out 10% of our content serves

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,760
eighty nine percent of our page requests

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,310
they also looked at the different paths

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,350
that people travel through the website

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,990
using Google Analytics and each of these

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,960
tabs aligns with one of 20 different

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,990
clusters and the clusters map pretty

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,360
cleanly to 20 different categories of

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,070
government services so now we have a

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,650
sense of top services top content by

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,530
traffic we have data on helping us

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,600
understand what top is the second thing

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,970
that our leadership did to get us

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,280
focused was to narrow the scope of the

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,770
purpose of mass gov and to clarify who

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,990
our target audience is

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,940
mass.gov flagship mass.gov is the

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,360
Commonwealth's flagship digital property

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,520
its purpose is to serve constituents to

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,620
get constituents as quickly and easily

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,009
as possible to the government services

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,810
that they are looking for so if there is

00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:26,590
information for government employees

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,410
about procurement procedures or HR

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,270
policies or a service that one

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,550
government agency provides to another

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,919
government agency that is distracting or

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,870
confusing our constituents that content

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,729
belongs somewhere else and if there's

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,500
content that no one looks at on mass gov

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:48,699
that content also belong somewhere else

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:52,240
so there's no single list of all of the

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,620
top services or of all the services for

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,520
us to draw from today but so far we've

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,610
identified 400 services that fit into

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,849
these top 20 categories and within those

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,159
there are 56 that are what we call G 2 C

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,169
and G 2 B meaning government to

00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,210
constituent or government to business

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,090
the rest are G to G government to

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,919
government and then there's some overlap

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,039
obviously with the top 10 percent of

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,449
pages the further we get clear this Venn

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,280
diagram becomes but we think it looks

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,320
like this and at the very middle where

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,620
you see all that overlap that's the

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,580
tippy top of our 80/20 pyramid that's

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,650
where we're going to have the biggest

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,259
impact with the smallest number of

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,449
changes that's where we're starting

00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,840
that's where we're staying focused until

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:40,229
we really get it right so great we've

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,509
got a starting point what do we do next

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,159
we know we need to change things we also

00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:49,110
know there's a lot that we're not going

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,130
to get right the first time so we are

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,289
we're also working on a cannot fail

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,110
project so we're trying to get our work

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,819
in front of users as fast as we can so

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,190
that we can fail fast and we can learn

00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,800
fast and create as many opportunities to

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,409
adjust as we can throughout the project

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,289
so we work in four months

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:10,960
excuse me three month project wide try

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:13,279
test iterate cycles broken up into teams

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,369
in two-week sprints

00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,759
in our first cycle we launched a pilot

00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:21,859
website and that first cycle ran from

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,079
August through November and the pilot

00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:26,179
website brought together three critical

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,929
components to get them working together

00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:32,899
number one our pattern lab based atomic

00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:35,599
design system which is suitable for use

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,029
in both Drupal and non Drupal web sites

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,800
so that we can encourage consistency and

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:43,370
reuse throughout our new mascot

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,100
ecosystem the second is a drupal powered

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,259
website and then third is our first

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,720
attempt at easy-to-read constituent

00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,910
centric content written in a sixth grade

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,670
reading level and following a repeatable

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,339
template that can be reused by varying

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,529
types of writers so we launched the

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,660
website and then in cycle two between

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,850
December and March we began to show the

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,449
results to real users and test and

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,209
iterate and here's what that looks like

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:14,240
for the 56 jiyuu C and G to be services

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,670
of the tippy-top we've been trying and

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,170
refining different approaches to bring

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,509
together these different pieces of

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,490
content that our constituents need in a

00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:28,189
single place we call these service pages

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,350
a service page on the right is basically

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:32,000
a repeatable template for pulling

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,970
together all these different types of

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,290
contents even when it cuts across

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,350
different agencies or even different

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,639
branches of government so this gives the

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,350
constituents everything they need to

00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,209
know about that service whether it's

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,199
registering a business or tuition

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:50,000
assistance or anything else here's an

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,459
example of the latest design for what a

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,230
services page will look like at the top

00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,149
of the pages on the left the bottom is

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,089
on the right this is in development

00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,949
right now and getting here and figuring

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,290
this out and figuring out all of the

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,629
different types of content that go into

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,819
a page like this has taken a lot of

00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:10,550
testing and iteration a lot of testing

00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,740
and a lot of iteration so here's a look

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,259
at how we've gone about soliciting

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,089
different types of feedback and evolving

00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,649
from a proof of

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,749
set to something that's more polished

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:25,240
the AIGA the American Institute for

00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:27,459
graphic artists hosted a public design

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,139
critique first with their own panel of

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,300
experts which included the Drupal

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,389
community zone Danny Norton from PEG

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,459
assistants who I think is here and then

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,309
they opened it up to the audience of

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:41,379
over 100 people which included graphic

00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:43,360
designers brand designers user

00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,309
experience designers and they gave us a

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,839
lot of helpful candid feedback and

00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:49,209
actually if you've noticed that there's

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,889
no logo on the pilot site today that's

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,800
because we've really taken a lot of

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,689
their feedback to heart and we're still

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,459
working on that logo too to refine it as

00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:02,050
a result we used a tool called tree jack

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:05,709
to test if we've actually made the

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:08,110
website easier to navigate the test

00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:10,180
results from tree Jack many of them came

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,589
back positive here's one where we had

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,860
lots of room for improvement though in

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,499
this test we asked users a question

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,939
you're looking excuse me you're thinking

00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:20,980
of moving to Massachusetts with your

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:23,470
family which includes two children ages

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,139
7 and 12 where would you go to find

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,629
information on schools the pie at the

00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:30,879
bottom left represents users who found

00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,699
their destination in green and users who

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,769
got lost in red and then if you look at

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:38,259
the pie tree on the right you can see

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,439
the path the users traveled to find

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:44,350
their destination so we put information

00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,920
on schools under a top-level menu item

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,709
called learning but almost half of the

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,360
testers started at living and many of

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:57,189
them then got lost so happily we figured

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,009
this out in December and so that gives

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:01,449
us lots of time to tune things and get

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,720
this right before we go live later in

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,579
the year we partnered with the Perkins

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,829
School for the Blind to test for

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,379
meaningful accessibility above and

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:14,410
beyond basic Americans with disability

00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,870
ad a compliance here you see a user

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,179
interacting with a page that's W CAG 2.0

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,209
compliant with the latest newest

00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:24,309
standard for ad a blind users who are

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,340
navigating the site with a keyboard and

00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:29,670
a screen reader rather than mice

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,320
touchscreens excuse me using the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,820
keyboard tap through the the screen and

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,920
screen readers rather than a mice and

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,580
and touchscreens had pretty positive

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,040
reviews Drupal 8 makes it a lot easier

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,950
for our developers to control tab order

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,170
with you know for people who are

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,660
navigating with keyboards and using the

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,960
new Drupal announce API it's also really

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,240
easy for us to provide audio cues to the

00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,400
users using screen readers when there

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,870
are changes on the screen like new

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,980
search results appearing or things

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,900
changing what compliance does not tell

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,290
you and what we saw in this test that

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:10,710
you see here here you see a lo site user

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,050
who is navigating the web zoomed way way

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,839
in on their screen and she never makes

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,520
it from the main content area over to

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,330
the right sidebar where there's critical

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,610
information for product testing by

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,800
sighted users we use a tool called

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,350
validate validate lis is a good fit for

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,620
us because it recruits the testers for

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,280
us and it lets us specify

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,490
demographically diverse and

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,410
representative groups of testers we use

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,450
validate lis to test how the pages

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,510
perform when a user gets to their actual

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,240
destination we wanted to know is it fast

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,130
is it easy is it intuitive for people to

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,070
figure out what to do to change their

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:53,190
address or to respond to a summons or to

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,980
start an application some interactions

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,560
we're confusing for both sighted and low

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,330
site users and so that helped us zero in

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,970
on high-value opportunities to make

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,760
improvements to the page layout so

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:08,339
here's an example where we revised the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,290
placement of the quick actions call-outs

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,700
that used to be on the right sidebar and

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,080
now you can see there in the middle of

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,029
these how-to pages

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,610
here you see the evolution of the how-to

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,950
pages parent page we used to call these

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,950
subtopic pages they were basically just

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,170
topical groupings of indirect individual

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,690
transactional services that the state

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,250
provides online now we're reinventing

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,750
these is something more usable more

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,709
useable and more meaningful for our

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,690
users which we call service pages and

00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,459
here you see related updates to the

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,430
parent of the service page which we call

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,300
topic pages so hopefully now these are

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,010
going to be better at giving

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,200
constituents the information they need

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,700
to zero in on the actual service they're

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,860
looking for and get there more quickly

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,180
another focus for us has been search to

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,660
get people to their destination faster

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,760
without confusion 70% of our users start

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,700
at Google and then go straight to an

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,990
inside page they skip the home page to

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,990
support a better search experience

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,839
we're following specifications published

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,380
by Google Microsoft and Yahoo at a

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,940
website called schema.org this enables

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,360
search engines like Google and also

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,910
other sites like Twitter and Facebook to

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,610
reuse content from our website in their

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,500
applications and then here in the left

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,649
in Google's knowledge graph we were

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,660
actually able to use a tool that Google

00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,310
provides called Google my business to

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,740
manually enter some of this information

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,779
and get some quick wins to provide some

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,120
of these experiences before the

00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,480
schema.org compliant content is even

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,060
online

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,430
but once that content is not online our

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,750
expectation is that more and more things

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,709
like this are going to happen

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,630
automatically but to do this we need to

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,600
make the leap from unstructured data to

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,459
structured data in our legacy CMS

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,440
everything is a page and all the

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:04,010
meaningful content is mushed together

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,649
into one big body field and it's sort of

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,690
mind-bending for our authors to get out

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,850
of this mindset of creating pages and

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,060
think about creating chunks of content

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,430
and making this leap and doing it

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,800
successfully is critical for search it's

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,230
critical for responsive design it is

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,490
important for changing something once

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,920
that we want to appear in many different

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,980
places and it was a breakthrough for us

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,190
to realize that

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,600
addressing this shift in mindset

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,600
explicitly with our authors is actually

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,890
a really critical thing for for

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,350
achieving this in our trainings and so

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,090
actually to that end here's a 45 second

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,260
video that's hot off the presses that

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,250
we're incorporating into our author

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,550
trainings beginning next week I can get

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,550
the play

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:17,920
[Applause]

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,220
[Applause]

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,299
so we learned yesterday at the Gov

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,309
summit that I'm sharing materials like

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,600
this is something that we can do right

00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:44,740
away to start collaborating with other

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,860
government agencies and have similar

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,250
needs so pretty cool to be able to bring

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:54,340
that and be able to start sharing it in

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,440
terms of data and analytics you can't

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,289
manage what you can't measure online

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,990
marketers talk about conversions and to

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:04,510
close the gap that we see between user

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,880
satisfaction in public and private

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,639
sector websites like in the McKinsey

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,960
report we need to start thinking this

00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:16,090
way too originally the word conversion

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,480
described the point at which a visitor

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,730
converts to becoming a paying customer

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,510
now we think of conversion basically

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,190
being any event that we can monitor in a

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,870
browser that indicates that a web

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,919
application is successful at doing

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,500
whatever it's supposed to do

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,580
so a form gets submitted a link gets

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,870
clicked material gets downloaded

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,789
sometimes the service that we're

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,909
delivering is information and so in that

00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:45,070
case you know that the page gets read so

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:48,820
we are reimagining everything in our

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:52,269
ecosystem as a path to a funnel to a

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,190
conversion and all of our content is

00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:56,409
about getting constituents to some

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,630
destination some endpoint where a

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,809
service gets delivered and a conversion

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,360
gets tracked we use Google tag manager

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,639
and Google Analytics to capture web

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,809
statistics our data scientists have

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,909
built and dashboards to help us

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,700
understand the data and it's too early

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:16,779
to understand right now it's only the

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,370
pilot data that we have you know what

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,380
insights we will live lean but what we

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,330
expect is that when we've got more data

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,220
this will show us which services are

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,019
performing the best and which ones

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,049
aren't which ones are the most effective

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,960
at driving users to forms applications

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:33,970
etc and which ones leave users feeling

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,060
lost and confused or found soft to call

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,460
centers

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,340
data is also emerging as a critical tool

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,650
in our change management toolbox so much

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,230
of what we do today is driven by someone

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:48,110
gut feeling or by inertia it's just the

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,500
way we've always done things and so this

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,210
has given us empowering tools to help

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,220
all of the people interacting with

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,260
content on our website challenge our own

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,590
assumptions and make decisions that are

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,710
better for our constituents this is

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,930
photoshopped but it's coming and this is

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,150
our next step to embed analytics right

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,910
into Drupal so that our authors can see

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,100
service by service how their content

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,230
performs and that can help them make

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,960
better decisions about how they can

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,400
improve their content so we still have a

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,470
lot to learn we're definitely getting

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,890
better at soliciting input and feedback

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,510
but if we get this right hopefully soon

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,290
the Commonwealth will be addicted to

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,610
this kind of data and user feedback so

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,880
if you're wondering what about the other

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,000
80% in our 80/20 pyramid we would love

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,430
to talk to you about it now that we have

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,290
made a substantive progress and we feel

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,520
like we we know where we need to get to

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,840
and the work is in progress at the top

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,240
of the pyramid we're letting ourselves

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,640
think about the rest of the ecosystem so

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,700
we've talked about item number one here

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,830
G to C and G to B services if you want

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,380
to hear about 2 through 7 please come to

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,700
one of our Box later in the week we'll

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,070
have a slide that tells you information

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,050
about that in just a second but before

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,600
that I want to turn it over to mush

00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,600
Weitzman to talk about open

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:20,560
[Applause]

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,930
okay so you guys heard about all the

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,790
amazing journey mapping that was done to

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,400
figure out what's important to the users

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,770
and found out about the rigorous design

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,800
work that's been done and lots of good

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:36,490
software development all available and

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,470
visible on pilot mass gov and it's

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,440
available to all of you okay we have

00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,990
made this software open source so you

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,450
can have a version of pilot mass gov

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,730
running on your own laptops show it off

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,350
to everyone you're working with see how

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,020
it works okay

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,870
yesterday the GUP summit we made this

00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:11,830
all public and open source so let me

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:13,530
just show you show you in a browser so

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,070
okay

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:22,860
and then it's there yeah totally tell

okay think I'm there there we go okay so

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,730
we're looking at our public github repo

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,600
you'll see its upper left you can find

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,720

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:20,460
for anyone who wants to join in and help

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,530
out there are public issues there you

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,480
can write issues which will respond to

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,540
you can make pull requests for the

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,180
software there you'll find quite a

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:40,160
modern composer based project they're

00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:43,250
based on Drupal 8 okay and that one okay

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,930
okay so just some links for you guys in

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,970
closing pilot math cup is live now

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,910
that's where all this experimentation is

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,930
open to the world please take a look we

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:59,960

that I just showed all right those are

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
the key lengths

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:28,399
okay there are three boss coming up we'd

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:30,169
really love people to join us in working

00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,799
sessions we're going to go over the open

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:36,460
math roadmap tomorrow we're going to do

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,169
a workshop where we help people install

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,489
take a look at the pattern lab design

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:43,969
system that we've built called Bay

00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:46,039
flower and also superset and other tools

00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:47,210
like that that we've mentioned and

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,710
finally we're going to be sprinting

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,710
Friday morning if anyone wants to join

00:24:53,889 --> 00:25:02,059
okay we'd love your feedback on this

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:04,190
session let us know how we did and I

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:06,950
think we're open for questions just for

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,119
a few minutes we have five minutes okay

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,950
five minutes of questions that we'll

00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,950
turn it over to the next presentation I

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:22,669
[Applause]

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:25,609
see a hand here if you could come up to

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:28,219
the microphone that's ideal I know it's

00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,639
a little bit of a pain but that'd be

00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:33,739
great

00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:38,229
I was looking at Pilot dot-gov if you

00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:38,229
could put the homepage back up again oh

00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:45,560
here

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,560
I'll just go here

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,500
I can't really see it but

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,390
I noticed you have your popular searches

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,880
there talk a little bit about how that

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,260
content is being chosen and how it's

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,510
being put up there if you would please

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,480
sure today that's being curated manually

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,790
so we're keeping an eye on Google

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,100
Analytics and we're linking to popular

00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,100
items yeah

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,889
someone's got to have a tougher question

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,889
than that

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,240
what's behind the searches today this is

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,400
powered by Google and there's a module

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,040
that we use that got us pretty far

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,660
pretty fast and improving the internal

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,910
Site Search Results

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,680
but it's being discontinued in the next

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,600
18 months so at some point it will be

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,900
something else but for a while it's

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,900
Google

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:03,120
sure so we're providing a system that

00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:05,010
will prompt them to enter structured

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,950
content they can't create pages anymore

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,929
and that's because we live in a world

00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,390
that's more complicated than pages age

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,350
metaphor is sort of outdated it made

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:18,000
sense or made some amount of sense when

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,799
we were designing for one screen but now

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,440
we're designing experiences for so many

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,140
different devices and interactions and

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,750
so you know when you think about

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,159
responsive design and making one piece

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,799
of content work at many different

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,809
viewports that's one reason that you

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,150
want the content to be more structured

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,190
but then when you think about indicating

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,070
that content to many different places

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,400
whether it's Google Twitter Facebook and

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:47,039
Bing all showing different mixed and

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,020
matched chunks or its many different web

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,960
properties across the broader method of

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:56,400
ecosystem we want addresses and phone

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:59,250
numbers and ours to update you have to

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,730
break those bits of content into their

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,299
own chunks having it all in one big body

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,559
field

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,409
literally makes it technically

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,030
impossible to do that sort of thing hi

00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:14,220
so when you go to mass dot gov there's

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,230
not an obvious link that icesoft gets a

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,240
pilot site so how are you directing

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,570
users to come here so you can get real

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,130
constituent testing up to now we've been

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,960
promoting the site to targeted audiences

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,510
at places like this to generate a lot of

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,270
our testing feedback and as soon as the

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,080
governor announces the site we will

00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,610
start broadly disseminating links to the

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,110
promotional video that some people saw

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,740
before the presentation started and

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:45,480
hopefully put links on mass gov in a

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,240
more visible place to get a broader

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,240
group of testers thank you

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,870
yep

00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:21,210
sure

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,090
the question was what was the biggest

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,440
barrier to doing user centered testing

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,620
in the big government bracket

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,170
bureaucracy procurement was a huge

00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,960
barrier for a while just getting the

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,460
tool so first getting the buy-in as a

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,320
barrier for some people we have a

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,510
leadership that are really interested in

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,309
this kind of testing and development but

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,410
then just getting our hands on the right

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:44,850
tools and then getting in front of the

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,010
right users getting in front of a

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,470
representative group of testers is not

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,570
trivial and so validate lis getting to

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,150
actually procure that and then let them

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,340
recruit the right group was a real

00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,750
breakthrough for us all right we have to

00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,130
cut it off there because the next group

00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,270
needs to get on thank you all right

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,780
thanks everyone for coming

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:06,859
we'll see you at the box and sprint

00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,859
