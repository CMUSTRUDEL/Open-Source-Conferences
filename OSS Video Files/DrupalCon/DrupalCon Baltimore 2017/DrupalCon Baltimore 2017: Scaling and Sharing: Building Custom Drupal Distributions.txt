Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Scaling and Sharing: Building Custom Drupal Distributions
Publication date: 2017-04-25
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	The promise of open source technology has always been about the ability to spread and scale. This is exemplified with Drupal distributions. In this session we will examine how we are leveraging open source, Drupal 8 with one of the largest federated non-profit organization in the world, the YMCA. We will focus specifically on a community driven initiative, Open Y, which is a Drupal distribution custom built for YMCAs everywhere. Some specific topics we will go over include:

Leveraging open source software to foster sharing and collaboration.
Developing a communication strategy focused on key benefits of Drupal and open source, such as cost and speed of innovation.
Creating a sustainable model in a federated organization from small to large YMCAs.
This session will reveal how open source software and Drupal can drive business results with better customer experiences, faster speed to market, and lower costs. It should be beneficial for all community members regardless of the position.

	00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,719
all right

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,710
hello so we are going to start and I

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,230
really happy to see all of you here and

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:22,590
to be we are going to talk about scaling

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,949
and sharing and probably if you work if

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,230
you were at the three ski nod32

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,710
mentioned open wide distribution that

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,690
was built by the Ford YMCAs so this dog

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,140
is going to be about how we were

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,820
building actually this distribution and

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,640
we are building it for federated

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,070
organizations so first of all I would

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,410
like to ask you to evaluate the

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,420
recession because this is like really

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,760
important to get feedback in case if you

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,579
like it just say I like it and guess you

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,020
dislike it you'll see that it is like it

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:01,289
and hi so my name is Alex I drove I'm

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,049
working a death of W and then he I came

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,420
here from far Ukraine I came here from

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,600
the Ukrainian community that is so far

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,570
from here and I am working in the web

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,450
development for nine years and I really

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,540
dream about on music dance so I really

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,210
like music writing some songs lyrics and

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,909
I hope that at some point I will have

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,780
like my own band that will do a great

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,869
physics alright it's gonna be tough for

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,400
me to stop so i'm craig paulmor I'm the

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,380
associate vice president of digital

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,659
product and innovation at the YMCA of

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,369
the greater Twin Cities I spent about

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,390
twenty years doing web product

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,240
development project management etc and

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,070
unlike wanting to be in a band I'm

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,259
dreaming about snowboarding just about

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,619
all the time that is my passion what I

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,310
like to do and so today is Alex mention

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,009
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,380
open Y and federated distributions and

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,159
what open Y really is is an open source

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,159
platform for YMCAs by YMCAs built on

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,229
Drupal so let's talk about what

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,360
federated means and what federated

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,819
models are so it's important to

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,930
understand the YMCA's operating model we

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,060
have 870

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,010
for independent associations the United

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,650
States twenty-seven hundred locations

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,510
servicing 20 million members what that

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,909
means is each one of those associations

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,799
has its own website its own technology

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,260
you heard Ruiz talk a little bit about

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,530
that during his keynote so 800 different

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,239
associations with 900 different websites

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,950
then if you expand that globally we

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,189
operate in a hundred and thirty

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,620
countries eleven thousand locations 58

00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:43,409
million participants so that federated

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,000
model is huge and unwieldy and it's a

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,370
big challenge for us to come up with a

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,379
unifying digital platform that's going

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,139
to work for all YMCAs and everybody's

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,090
needs and so here's what that looks like

00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,730
globally now if you're in the United

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,549
States we are frequently associated with

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,049
being a gym or things of that nature but

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,450
that's not what we do in every one of

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,659
these countries in India for example we

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,889
focus a lot on childhood development

00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:10,620
education tutoring things of that nature

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,989
you may not even find a single YMCA gym

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,879
in a location like that so whatever it

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,930
is that we build needs to work for the

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,400
needs of all of these different YMCAs so

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,129
as I mentioned we're more than just a

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,370
gym but for a lot of you that's the only

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,470
way that we're seen we develop youth we

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,720
inspire healthy living we change our

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,579
communities the YMCA is one of the

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,220
largest nonprofits in the world we have

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,409
a huge goals but really limited

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,970
resources and we need to change public

00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,769
perception our customers expect us to

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,259
have great experiences for them online

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,639
they don't necessarily care that we have

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,280
limited budgets and that we're a

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,439
non-profit they want to be able to sign

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,169
up for programs to be able to join a gym

00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,439
online etc and we're not meeting those

00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,939
needs so we needed a national tool that

00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,989
could better communicate and deliver our

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:05,430
mission digitally and globally so what

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,370
is this open wide thing that we've been

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,419
hearing about it's really three things

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,519
first it's a philosophy

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,709
just like the Drupal community its

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,859
collaboration that drives innovation and

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,630
impact next it's the community the

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,239
community of YMCAs and technology

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,909
partners getting us to work together and

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,740
work better together and finally it is

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,310
that open source platform for marketing

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,540
econ

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,880
and digital products so for the YMCA is

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,100
the benefit of open why is it an open

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,980
platform built by us that we own we

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,350
control and that we have the ability to

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,150
drive the destiny of we have low

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,340
switching costs if we want to change

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,930
move things around and one of the things

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,060
that's really exciting is the freedom to

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,180
work independently with any agency or

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,100
partner because it's all open source any

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,160
YMCA can grab the code and work with

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,300
whomever they choose finally one of the

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,980
things that we're really excited about

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,300
is we've been able to partner with a

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,790
local charter school in the Twin Cities

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,500
called Brabeck Adam II Reb Academy has

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,900
helped us with programming some of the

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,360
content for open Y sites so this brings

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,419
us the opportunity to get youth involved

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,350
with YMCAs and do youth in ways that

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,630
we've never been able to before now for

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,210
agencies the value and benefit of open Y

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,060
is to reduce the cost of building the

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,979
basics of a website and those that cost

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,320
savings can be passed on and REE

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,720
leveraged by focusing on things like

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,270
marketing campaigns and things that will

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,860
help YMCAs to grow their revenue and

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,390
achieve their mission goals and

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,390
objectives and finally for technology

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,120
partners by us looking at things with

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,740
open api's open source we're able to do

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,979
things in ways that we never were before

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,320
we can take a schedule and now display

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,289
that content on a treadmill with a

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,110
digital screen we can create a chatbot

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,190
etc all sorts of things that YMCAs we're

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,470
never able to do before

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,970
we can now do things to open Y and some

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,530
of the expanded and enhanced API

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,630
capabilities that we have with Drupal so

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,510
at its core open Y is a customer

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,310
experience platform it hides in elements

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,740
and talks to different components like

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,200
our personal training software group

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,690
fitness systems we do a be testing our

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,039
analytics platforms all of that is

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,050
connected with Drupal at the core now

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,180
the operating model for how open Y is

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,160
created and built within this federated

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,280
model is we get investments from

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,760
national Y associations like the Y USA

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,870
and larger YMCAs YMCA the Twin Cities

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,490
Weil

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,770
first see the strategy the product

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,470
development and the repository owner of

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,270
open why so we take that investment and

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,310
then we work with agency and technology

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,290
partners we don't have any developers on

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,930
staff today in the twin cities so we

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,090
work with wonderful agencies like ffw

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,650
and people like Alex to build out the

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,240
open Y experience next it's really key

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,760
to get the communication elements right

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,610
for a big distribution like this so we

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,530
have our website open ymca org we meet

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,930
twice annually it summits where we

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,140
invite technology partners agency

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,350
partners and YMCA associations we have a

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,990
slack channel a monthly email newsletter

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,750
we put out YouTube tutorials and we have

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,650
the repository out on github and a page

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,240
on drupal.org so there's a lot of

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,910
politics when it comes to getting

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,470
something like this adopted across the

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,570
organization because again there's no

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,660
governing body that tells these YMCAs

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,100
but they have to use open Y so the first

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,680
is making sure that we're sharing a

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,420
clear vision of what open Y is what the

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,460
benefits are and that we want it to

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,930
serve all YMCAs next is the inclusion

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,060
building alliances making sure that

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,970
people have voices and that we have

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,830
organic growth finally the

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,710
decision-making has to be very clear we

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,210
need to be on message there's no buy-in

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,470
there's no money that people have to

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,700
spend to get on open Y and then we need

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,860
to make sure that we're action-oriented

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,750
and that we're taking a we versus a me

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,180
approach our solutions need to work for

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,650
all not just me in the Twin Cities it

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,970
has to work for all YMCAs over the last

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,670
10 months we've had some really great

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,500
adoption 21 YMCAs are committed to the

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,630
platform either using it today are

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,910
already on the platform are working

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,430
towards a site launch and another 25

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,270
YMCAs are evaluating and these numbers

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,280
increase all the time so why did we pick

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,040
Drupal why was that the path we went

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,810
down when we looked at YMCAs what were

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,330
they using for their architecture today

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,130
most of them were on PHP based platforms

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,220
a lot of them were already on Drupal

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,200
Drupal 7 etc so it made sense for us to

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,220
go down this path plus all of the

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,760
wonderful things that your

00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:01,440
offers out of the box and with that I'm

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:05,010
going to hand it back over to Alex yep

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,310
Thank You Queen so first of all I would

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,250
like to make a statement we truly

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,950
believe that with open why we make the

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,810
world a better place and that's not a

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,990
joke that you may potentially here in

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,840
the Silicon Valley to be serious that's

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,560
the truth that we truly believe in and

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,140
the reason for that because working with

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,890
nonprofit organizations that hear about

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,020
healthy living that care about kids

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,320
about all people about people with

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,930
accessibility problems so eventually

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,540
working with organizations that hear

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,540
about three main things about spirits

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,970
about minds and about body so and

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,060
frankly speaking this is kind of the

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,930
most inspiring and motivating project in

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,090
my life that I'm working on so cool

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,310
statement huh probably you may think

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,420
what is this crazy guy going to talk

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,760
about so today I'm going to kind of tell

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,780
you a story how we get to the place

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,290
where we are now

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,620
so we've released the open wide version

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,960
1.0 which mentioned that it's

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,300
breakthrough for the YMCA community so

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,810
today I'm going to share with you how we

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,040
get to the point where we are now so

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,620
when we started working on the

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,930
distribution we've realized that first

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,750
of all we should really clarify our

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,560
goals that we should eventually get we

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,450
call that the mission of open one and

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,060
three is like mission of open wide from

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,000
the technical perspective so as correct

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,860
mentioned we should do the customer into

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,870
the center of all interactions on the

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,870
website and with that with distribution

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,300
we were challenged to provide best

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,870
customer experience that the Barclay

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,960
data means that stuff members customers

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,410
of the YMCA's they should get the easy

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,650
access to all trainings of exercises or

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,810
programs that YMCAs like offer on their

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,850
website and with that also stuff

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,760
is that are working on the content that

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,190
put some promotion campaigns on the

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,650
website they should get a really great

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,980
experience really great interface where

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,410
they can do this so the next thing I

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,870
think right now is the most important

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,540
one the collaboration platform because

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,970
Craig mentioned that there were a lot of

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,970
different web sites powered by Drupal

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,760
but there were now centralized place

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:39,570
where everyone can contribute something

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,730
so let's imagine we have 100 websites on

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,040
Drupal for different YMCAs and they'd

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,710
spend tons of money in order to build

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,589
different features but they just did not

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,970
share them and they spend money over and

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:54,930
over again in order to create new

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,670
websites and with that in case if we

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,710
have the collaboration platform and

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,220
centralized place where we will have all

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,380
the features we actually reduce the cost

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,240
that should be spent in order to build

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,360
new websites because there will be great

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,580
starting point for new business and for

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,120
new websites that should be that should

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,830
be developed and next one it was the

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,750
most interesting part for the

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,440
development team for the technical guys

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,420
who was working on this on this project

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,820
it's a high how to provide scalability

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,339
and flexibility because there are a lot

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,370
of different organizations they all have

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,180
different requirements and with that in

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,010
the distribution we should have like

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,960
scalable and flexible modules and

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,140
components that should be just usually

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,400
disabled or enabled and the last one

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,740
it's kind of that one summarizes

00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,540
everything that I've just outlined

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,089
because with all those points from the

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,180
mission of open Y we can just rapidly

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,950
bring the wine C business to the market

00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,700
in case if they have really outdated

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,209
website

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,209
I'm from legacy CMS so with all those

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:09,029
points they can really bring their

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:12,720
business to the market in a rapid way

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,880
and really quickly so of course with the

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,430
mission we've learned all the things

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,910
about open water boats for it we've

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,450
learned a lot of things about YC

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,580
first of all we've learned the history

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,960
because this is important to be on the

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:32,030
same page with teams from the YMCA

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,440
because they have their own philosophy

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,850
they have on approaches they have on

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,580
workflow that we should follow in order

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,260
to do a really great product or that one

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,870
see also we've learned a lot about

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,790
digital products and about the earth

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,830
technologies that they are using like

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,680
they are using a lot of different

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,900
vendors and certain services that we

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,270
should create integration with and of

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,890
course learned a lot about brands and

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,010
guidelines in order to all of their

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:05,540
standards that are shared across all

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:08,480
departments and organizations so we've

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,970
realized that we have a lot of different

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,100
websites on Drupal we have a lot of

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,810
different features on those websites why

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,540
we should develop everything from

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,690
scratch we can just take those features

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,350
adjust the couple and incorporate in

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,930
help and wine so here is listed a few

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,090
organizations that are committed and

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:33,080
contributed into the initial version of

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:35,210
open wine but there are a lot a lot of

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,040
different parties that are contributing

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,340
right now it's not listed on this slide

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,010
so basically from the fragmentation of

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,900
different features we were challenged to

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,610
assemble the open wine and basically

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,730
release distribution with all those

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,370
features and if we take a look at the

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,850
flexibility that we should support we

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,640
have different types of organizations so

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,220
the first one the small YMCA they may

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,500
have only once it will go single

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,320
building with the gym or with a pool

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,440
they have only a few stop staff members

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,450
and they do not have that much time in

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,330
order to maintain content on the website

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,870
in order to set up a new website on

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,180
Drupal and do something really difficult

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,330
for the website so the next one the

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,090
medium YMCA they may have a few branches

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,730
maybe they can support and provide

00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,160
summer camps and free group exercises

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,920
but they are not that because a large

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,839
fancy

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,209
for the large coin see they need a lot

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,600
of different configurations with the

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,959
third party services they need a lot of

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,489
different features and only extracting

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,559
personalization and that great stuff

00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:50,220
that is really interesting for the

00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:53,399
developers and technical team so frankly

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:57,269
speaking if we reflect the same on the

00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:00,119
costs and budget that they have as well

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:03,059
they have my budget according to their

00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:05,790
size medium when's he have limited

00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:09,899
amount of money in order to set up new

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:13,230
websites but with the platform and with

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,799
the collaboration philosophy small MCA

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,679
will get an access to features that

00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:22,499
larger MCA can afford so before in order

00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,899
to has example to create personal

00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:26,730
training booking forum the website small

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,439
lens he should pay a lot of money but

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,779
with the open wide since it will be

00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:34,759
there they can just take it and use it

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:38,160
out the box so we were thinking about

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,860
architectural open one because all those

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,419
wines he is they have different

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,019
requirements they have different needs

00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:49,470
and we should solve all those needs and

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,319
satisfy everyone who is using open wide

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,509
distribution and with that with 3d

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,819
architecture the distribution for the

00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:59,279
nice burg so we have something that is

00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:02,579
not visible at all to the end customers

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,549
but it will support and it will move

00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:09,899
forward our distribution in a long term

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:11,730
run so with that we actually started

00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:14,639
with that in mind we started working on

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,399
the distribution so first of all I would

00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:21,260
like to show you a demo how the open

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:24,360
while look like right now so in order to

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,839
have understanding what I'm talking

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,559
about from the side like what do we have

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,389
out of the box how you can use it and

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,149
you will see from here that we a little

00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:39,120
bit ahead of Drupal because twist dress

00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:41,279
mentioned that they have initiative of

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,570
having the demo content in the

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,480
distribution they have any

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,669
chief in order to have some basic theme

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,340
that will be a little bit better than

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:54,130
Bartok right now so we have that in the

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,130
distribution the example we have those

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,840
demo programs and categories for the

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,019
wines here we have functionality of

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,720
alerts on the page we have some elements

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:07,269
and components like banner with the blog

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,110
post some static content with the grid

00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:13,630
columns also we can open the location

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,629
finder page this is just a landing page

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:20,169
where we can take a look at the map

00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:22,539
all available branches and example in

00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:24,669
cases upon the favorite branch we can

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,830
take a look at the branch working hours

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,350
reach them some information about that

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,649
branch take a look at the blog posts

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:36,220
that are associated with branch and then

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:39,669
we have a lot more features out of the

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,649
box so here you can you can see just

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,710
some landing page with the static

00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:46,870
content that could be about page or just

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,830
looking for volunteers or something like

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,629
that and we have the blog section where

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,230
we can find different blogs we can

00:18:52,629 --> 00:19:00,309
filter down by location like category by

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,200
text filter and example open the blog

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,509
post page itself in order to read

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,639
through the content of the website so

00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:09,519
that's the only small amount of features

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:12,490
but that will give you an understanding

00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:16,330
what we are building and what we have

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:18,279
right now so we've started with

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,759
development and realized that we have

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:25,149
the challenge number one that sees how

00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,870
to provide scalability and flexibility

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:30,730
so we've gathered all our team leads and

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,980
athletes in order to figure out how

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,909
actually we are going to provide the

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,919
flexibility and scalability and

00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:40,509
eventually at the end of this meeting

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,000
everyone in the group set all right

00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:46,090
challenge accepted we will work on that

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,860
and for sure we will be successful at

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:52,470
this at them so and with that we came up

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,040
with the component based

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,840
so you may be familiar with that

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,420
approach because in Drupal 8 we are

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,840
following theirs we are using Drupal

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,550
modules that are like independent from

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,920
the system and just have a list of

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,770
dependencies so we are using the same

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,400
approach and if you take a look at the

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:16,920
basic basic page that we see on all

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,600
websites that we are seeing in the

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,480
Internet so we have some general

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,470
elements we have header we have footer

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,780
and content editors through the area

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,070
between header and footer as the

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,230
customizable area so the they want to

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,420
play with layouts they want to place

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,790
different components in different

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,440
regions of the wheel so they should have

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:47,970
the full control on this customizable

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,190
area so let's take a look at the basic

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,060
landing page that we provide out of out

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,970
of the box and the open one so we have a

00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:59,960
few components component number one and

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,360
just banner who is call to action bar

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,390
the second component just dynamic list

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,200
of blog posts that are added on the

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:12,450
website and promoted to the home page

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,290
then we have a few more components that

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:19,530
are steady so we have static content

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,120
titles labels and different columns if

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,090
you take a look from the perspective

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,350
which of those components are dynamic

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,870
and which are static

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,480
so the first one is static we just go to

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,930
Drupal admin interface with a broad

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,660
image we specify some tags there and

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,270
here we go so the next one is dynamic

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,270
one whenever we add the new blog post to

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:44,880
the website it appears here so there is

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,530
no static of reference to all the blog

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,380
posts that should be visible here and

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:52,250
next to block the aesthetic as well and

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,530
with component-based architecture

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:59,220
content editors they are able to play

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:02,670
with the page and place dynamic blocks

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,100
in between static blocks it's great and

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,240
powerful feature for content editors and

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,310
they are happy with

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:14,040
because they can build pages they can

00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:17,090
build pages in really easy way and they

00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,650
can all pages that they can just imagine

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,050
they went for that approach we are using

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,260
paragraphs we are we really love

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,450
paragraphs in case if you still not

00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,820
familiar with that module you should

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,890
definitely go to that link and figure

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,020
out how it works and how you can use it

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:40,380
and adopt your project so I mentioned

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:43,650
that we treat every block on the page as

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,410
a component and in our opinion every

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,750
component should consists off so the

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,760
first one the model although this is the

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,370
place where we store data this is the

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,440
storage of our data that could be

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,960
content types media types the economy

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,630
terms whenever you whatever you are

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,670
using on your website but the next one

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,990
is a controller this is something that

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:09,600
gets the data from storage and that's

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:14,520
something with that so the third one the

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,540
view view this is the like weird that we

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,020
haven't seen

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,210
that's just usual pattern MVC patterning

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,420
from programming so we are using it in

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,420
order to build components and view in

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,380
Drupal 8 a tough one yes there is no

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,480
easy way how to move viewer from theme

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,750
into components so there is no way how

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,000
to place template in component and an

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,460
easy way I mean there is no way to do

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,370
that without custom code so you should

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,520
write a few functions or methods in

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,980
order to provide template from from your

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,990
model as example for none other for some

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,460
specific field and this is in progress

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,310
this is something that we are working

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,500
right now so the next thing that should

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:02,490
be our out-of-the-box and component this

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,650
is the grayscale design and a grayscale

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:08,700
design it means that components should

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:11,850
provide some basic and defaults tiles

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,400
for the component so in case if we

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,670
enable it even embarking in Drupal that

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,750
in Drupal 7 or in Drupal 8 so it will

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,320
have good looking just

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,720
the black and white design so with that

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,060
we can just create new themes and

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,850
out-of-the-box every symbol will looks

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:35,470
good we just should write a few CSS

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,540
lines in order to make it even better

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,150
than it's out of the box in the

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,990
component and of course tests right now

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:46,090
we have tests that are stored in general

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,400
in general for the whole distribution

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:53,080
but at some point we will get depths in

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,940
the components so questions question to

00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:04,480
you guys you know the common problem of

00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:07,350
multiple distributions in ideas and

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,350
other ideas

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:17,830
so yeah those are good ones but but the

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,960
the current problem of most Drupal

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,910
distribution it's difficult to disable

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,050
modules and components that they are

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:29,830
provide our out-of-the-box so I think

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:33,190
you've experienced that use case when

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,560
you install new fancy distribution you

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,170
you realize that you need only small

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,720
part of this distribution and you are

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,220
trying to disable some specific modules

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,130
and components from this distribution

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:49,960
and you just decide that all right I

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,030
will just create new website from

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,420
scratch I will not use that distribution

00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:58,840
at all so in my experience this is the

00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,750
most the most common problem of almost

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:06,250
all Drupal distribution that we've ever

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:08,530
used so and with that now decoupled is

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,950
our favorite word because we would

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,020
decouple can every task that we create

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,540
for the developers and they understand

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,330
that when they create in your module new

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:22,960
component something new for the project

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,320
they treat it as something separate that

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,350
should be easily from the system so and

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,640
with that we have minimum dependencies

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,040
and other component

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,960
so it works the same as with Drupal

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,790
modules you create module you specify a

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,480
few the damages and other modules and

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,840
here we go

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,100
you just have dependencies you do not

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,370
place your another content type in the

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:51,280
just garbage of all configurations file

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,970
files you just put in to some specific

00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:59,170
place where you always know how to get

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:05,770
it from there and based on this based on

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:07,900
component architecture our project from

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,300
the cut perspective looks really good

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,850
because it looks like we've just cleaned

00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,310
it up like this guy on the slide so we

00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,440
always know where to find some specific

00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,570
component where to find some specific

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,530
module where we should please example

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:25,090
alter and we always know how to disable

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,700
specific components because as I

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:31,060
mentioned there are small MVAs that

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,620
needs only a small piece of the

00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,140
distribution and everything else should

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,810
be disabled and turn it off

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,550
so if we take a look at the open Y

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,160
architecture from the business

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,710
perspective first of all we have to

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,980
basically years in the distribution we

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,660
have the data structure we have a lot of

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,880
core features and we have the

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:55,510
presentation layer that is visible on

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,870
the website for the potential customers

00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,930
and potential members also we have a lot

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:04,210
of CRM sorry a lot of server services

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,600
that we should create integration with

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,850
we have web applications social

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,970
occasions mobile applications and even

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,760
equipment at the branches that we should

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,640
interact with when members of the wine

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,100
tee with their branch and of course on

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,890
top of this we have analytics and

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:29,710
tracking in order to track all the DVDs

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:33,250
that happen in the open Y on the server

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,650
very services and even add the branches

00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,690
with equipment so and in order to

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,730
support that we create the integration

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,140
layer in order to interact with

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,530
third-party services

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,720
and we export data to the data layer

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,690
from the distribution to analytics and

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,870
tracking and we are using web services

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,120
in order to provide support for server

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,740
services and the array VI and the direct

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,090
eventually with the fitness equipment

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:03,430
and mobile applications so you could

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,850
take a look at the components that we

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:09,100
have inside of my inside base layers we

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,200
have the data structure we have the

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,110
setup of content types

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,470
media types economy terms and vocabulary

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,300
so for the core features we have a lot

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,790
more features that you may see on the

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,370
slide there is just not enough space to

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,190
place them so with the temple we have

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,290
location finder web forms

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,780
personalization alerts a lot more things

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,760
and then the presentation we are right

00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,770
now we have only one theme that calls

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,750
open wire walls but at some point we

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:41,650
will have a lot more features sorry a

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:45,970
lot more themes and there is also always

00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:48,850
way to create your custom theme so for

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:52,330
the third-party services we create

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,760
integration with theorems like X Annette

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,520
% 5 with digital asset management

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,890
systems with marketing system like

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,980
Salesforce marketing cloud with AV

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:06,790
testing system the nation etc a lot more

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:09,250
server services also we have the

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:13,150
analytics on top of this so in order to

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:18,700
track all of it is in all places so if

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:21,910
we get back to our 1c diets we and if we

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:25,660
reflect the complexity for every one C

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:28,540
so it's really obvious that for small M

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,400
C we have the small complexity in the

00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,810
distribution because they need only a

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,890
few content types

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:38,350
we need only a few basic features and

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:43,480
they will use some basic theme from the

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:45,310
distribution for medium for the medium

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,890
one series they have also medium

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,660
complexity so they need a few more

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,810
content types and few more features

00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,930
maybe integration with three exercises

00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:58,330
and that's it and the complexity of

00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,100
large when C is really high so they just

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,140
need everything they just need

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,690
everything integration with every single

00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:09,370
server very service all condom types all

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:11,890
media features and and so on and we we

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,170
are happy to say that parts of the

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,330
distribution they are decoupled enough

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,510
so they are not related to white

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,690
specifics at all you can just take them

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:25,630
and use example on my projects I'm using

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:28,780
like my own projects I'm using media

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,900
teacher I am using landing page wizard

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm using analytics and tracing so I've

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:38,200
just took them from the distribution and

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,330
eventually I will get I will get updates

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,370
for free from the community so that's

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:49,240
that's cool and after when we've created

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:52,180
like enough flexible district lexical

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,920
architecture afford open one so we

00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,980
realized that the next challenge of

00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,920
integration with server services so it's

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,710
always painful process for the

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,080
development team in order to create

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,010
integration with third-party services

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,060
and i'm painful i mean it's always fun

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,930
really fun yeah so when we've created a

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:20,170
few basic rules how to create

00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:22,600
integration with server services so we

00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,780
just ask a question is it a background

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,140
job that should do something in the

00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,360
background if that's where yes we just

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,700
create new service that could be Drupal

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,480
8 service that could be trash , that

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,150
could be

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,600
cron job but we just create something

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:44,980
that will be triggered at some point by

00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,820
some system so next question should be

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,280
displayed to the customers so in case if

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,890
it's be displayed to the customers we

00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,120
create a new component and place it on

00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:01,150
the page so here is our great example

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,890
with landing page again so we have a few

00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,330
blocks out of the box but at some point

00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:07,269
we realized

00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:09,190
we have the boring component with a list

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:12,940
of blog post that should be replaced

00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:15,490
with the free group exercise classes and

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,049
schedule and we just usually replace

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,570
that block on the home page so we've

00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,970
created components we've created module

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,679
we've set up the condom structure for

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,289
death to the next release we just

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,029
release that component and then condemn

00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:30,820
that there is a radio to place it on the

00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:32,950
page and then it's a point again we

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,200
realized that we would like to replace

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:41,980
that boring block with the list of

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,080
products for personal trainings and also

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,870
instead of banner we would like to place

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,419
the personal training schedule for so we

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:52,779
just created three new components and

00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:55,419
set the candidate udders here we go now

00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:58,240
they are available in the content

00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:02,409
editing workflow so you can put them and

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,769
place them on your pages so after that

00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:07,750
we've realized that we have the next

00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:10,960
challenge next challenge easy

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:14,980
installation process for non-technical

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,669
and technical users so here is the

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:21,520
technical installation so it it look

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:24,750
like this you just run the bus script

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,550
you have some progress bar and

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,859
eventually you will see that your

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,320
optimal installation has been finished

00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,720
you can go and complete your

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,060
installation through some users of

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,300
course I'm kidding that that's not the

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:42,700
actual installation of the open wide but

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,830
in ideal world at some point we will

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,460
have it right right like this so you

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:51,970
just run the script and you will get the

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,220
website so right now we have pretty

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,349
similar bar script but you will see

00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:00,460
there are a lot of weird lines out of

00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:02,080
lock out dude that in ideal world again

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,390
this should look like this even for

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,220
technical guys they they really like

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,150
cast I guess

00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:13,520
so also also we are working on the non

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:16,820
technical installation we are working on

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:21,109
this in order to provide and like make

00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:23,510
the customers make the interface for

00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:26,119
customers so they can set up even

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,910
non-technical departments can set up new

00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,900
website just by using some Soompi third

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:34,880
example we will have the domain you can

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,040
specify the platform example you have

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,800
your own server and digitalocean

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,380
or you would like to set up Amazon

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,750
server server or you have just custom

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,390
server and when you submit it eventually

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,220
so from the technical installation and

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,570
non-technical installation you would you

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,630
will get to the place where you should

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,030
complete default we third for the Drupal

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,099
installation so you will go through the

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,800
folk steps and also you will go through

00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,420
custom steps in order to select demo

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,570
content that you would like to see on

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,790
the website you you can select

00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:11,780
components that should be enabled by

00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:14,510
default and eventually you will get new

00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,990
website then the next step you can

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,270
customize that website we have the theme

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,920
by default open more goals and we have

00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:27,650
feature that you can select predefined

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,109
presets for that theme or just customize

00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:33,140
everything on the website in order to

00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:36,500
have your branded colors on the website

00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,140
and then you can like complete the

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,849
enough changes go through some security

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,680
checks

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:44,900
go light checklist and announce your

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,510
lunch and Twitter Facebook being your

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,970
friends different departments and see

00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:54,410
here we go we've just launched new

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:56,720
website and the magic part of that then

00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,320
you will get new features from the

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,720
community and magic word here for free I

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,109
haven't put that into the slide but

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,510
magic word for free because it works the

00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:12,500
same in the same way as a Drupal

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,780
community so someone can contribute an

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,240
example that could be one see or just

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,130
individual contributor and eventually

00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,950
with new release you will get new

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:25,990
component or new feature on you

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:28,660
website so with that we've realized that

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,610
all right we have new website we have a

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,280
lot of different key websites and we

00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:37,360
should support somehow upgrade path for

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,850
that so and of course different YMCA

00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,170
small web page they can use just what we

00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,050
provide out of the box

00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:47,740
medium YMCAs they can customize

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:51,130
something and the large fancy they build

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:54,670
a lot of different customizations on TT

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:59,410
distribution so let's just imagine

00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:02,470
situation when in open wide 1.0 we

00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:06,490
provide that fancy listing of blog posts

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:09,520
with a lot more bottom and then at some

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:12,760
point on the last life cite the example

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:16,660
developers or business owners they've

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:19,180
decided to change a lot more button to

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,210
full pager so that was the requirement

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:27,010
for your specific website but with the

00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:29,680
new release in open y 1.1 we just change

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,650
the label for this button and we have a

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,240
conflict here because this specific

00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:39,580
component this specific configuration

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,790
has been changed manually by the site

00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:45,880
owner and we are not able to provide

00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:48,640
upgrade for this one so we've created a

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,150
tool that we call open why upgrade

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,150
dashboard where we display all places

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,520
where we have conflicts of example we

00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,590
have the configuration name then we have

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,380
specific property within this

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:05,110
configuration where we have the conflict

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,820
and then we have passed through the

00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,130
configuration to original configuration

00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,400
that we have an open wide and we have

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,470
lists affections so you can edit that

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,230
message but actually you will never do

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,870
that or you can take a look at the

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,880
difference between your actual

00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,220
configuration and within configuration

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,680
and open wide and you can delete that

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,750
message when you delete this message you

00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,470
are just seeing alright I've just

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,580
resolved this manually or I agree to

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:38,390
reject the update from the

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:41,180
version of open one so you can decide in

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,490
case if you should resolve that conflict

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,830
manually or you can just be remove that

00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,260
message from the dead board by looking

00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,500
at the at the deef as example for that

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,470
use case we are fine we are we are good

00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,830
to go with the full pager because we do

00:39:54,470 --> 00:40:02,180
not need like that change for the label

00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:04,160
and with that we've get to the point of

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,470
course we are using ingenious

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,420
integration in order to test everything

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:14,270
and we realized so that's actually me

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,910
when I realized how many bills we should

00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:21,800
support for the continuous integration

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:23,720
workflow so let me explain so the first

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,970
bill that we should have from the

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,920
continuous integration that the fresh

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,650
installation open wild that just

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,150
installation out-of-the-box from the

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:36,980
installation profile so the next one

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,110
we've seen the slide where we went

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,320
through the installation process of to

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,540
plate and of course we had custom step

00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,490
there and we should have an environment

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,520
in order to go through the steps and

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:52,970
verify that everything works fine there

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,000
and the next one the great path cells

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:59,330
this is the actual environment where we

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,260
test updates from previous version to

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:05,390
the new version so we have replaces we

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,980
should have three environments in order

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:12,620
to just verify that developer

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,190
successfully completed his job and of

00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:18,740
course additional environment for the

00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,570
bf4 cut sniffers and for a composer bill

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,360
that we are working right now in order

00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:26,570
to verify that our distribution will

00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,240
work it an all different PHP versions or

00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:33,460
on all different environments and we

00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,920
eventually we can like we can build the

00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:39,020
website using composer so here is just

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,890
an example of response from our CI

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:45,170
server we have first wing leads to the

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:48,110
fresh of my installation where we see

00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,630
everything out of the box the next one

00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:54,260
the link to upgrade path installation

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:57,020
where we can test our updates and then

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,990
link to the installation steps and the

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,360
wizard that we can use in order to

00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:05,330
verify installation steps and of course

00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,240
the report from be advanced so here is

00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,460
the green report for the be head test

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,300
but in case if you see something the

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:17,120
rest you should go do your work

00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:21,230
again and again and again here we have

00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:25,130
the green light here so any now with all

00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:27,970
those challenges we think that we've

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,250
successfully like released open white

00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:34,460
0.1 and that the breakthrough for the

00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:39,140
ymc business and why I will explain a

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:41,120
little bit better but first of all we we

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,430
will take a look at the open white today

00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,830
what we have right now based on those

00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,370
challenges that we were struggling with

00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:52,310
the first of all we have the source code

00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:55,040
in Drupal the doric which is actually

00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:57,440
the mirror of github repository that we

00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,140
are working on right now there are all

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,260
the colorful request issues they are on

00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:07,640
github and the main website of the open

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,100
wide distribution often ymc at work also

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,080
we have a few materials the first one

00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,790
the case study on Drupal the dworkin

00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,190
case if you are interested do you

00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,950
actually read the story why are we

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:21,260
actually doing that and why we're

00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:23,660
actually creating the community why we

00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:27,070
have the contributors for that and the

00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:30,110
blog post from Driss and his blog about

00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:33,320
YMCA about YMCA movement and

00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,840
breakthrough for their business and in

00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,880
case if you would like to evaluate open

00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,910
why right now so you can do that on your

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,160
laptops mobile devices tablets we have

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:48,620
the sandbox environment we have the

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:51,500
public admin password and user name so

00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,600
you can go there play with it even ruin

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,700
the website anyway we will rebuild it in

00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,190
one hour so and based on that I would

00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:06,400
like to make an announced

00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:09,339
and so now with the open y 1.0 everyone

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,579
C can get new secure and powerful

00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:15,130
website in less than 15 minutes so there

00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:18,790
is a link to YouTube video that actually

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:23,770
video from Craig where he explains how

00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:25,960
to set up new website with that default

00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:29,560
content with a lot of different pages

00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:32,290
with the membership calculator with

00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,569
location finder in less than 15 minutes

00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:38,740
and that the breakthrough for the YMCA

00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:42,040
business because now small YMCAs have an

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,849
access to tool that will allow them to

00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:50,200
set up their new website and get the

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:55,240
features that they cannot afford before

00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,790
that moment so and our next focus is

00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,119
building the community and like involve

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:04,270
contributors because as you know without

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,550
the community product will not survive

00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:09,730
on community I mean not only the

00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,380
community of YMCAs who is going to

00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,270
contribute to the project but also

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:17,650
without support from the Drupal

00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:19,960
community so you may wonder how you can

00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,420
contribute so that's free easy process

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,630
and straightforward first of all you can

00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,970
create a fork of main project on the

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:30,720
github then you can find some

00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:32,980
interesting issue or just contribute

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,650
documentation or something to the

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,079
project then create new pull requests

00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:41,619
right steps for View and tasks pane

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,150
Tanner's to actually review what review

00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:45,730
your pull request

00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,920
maybe merge pull request to eventually

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:52,839
you will get some commits on drupal.org

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,790
so also there are a lot of other ways

00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,849
how you can contribute to the project

00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:02,740
you can work on the documentation design

00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:05,710
user testing translation content just be

00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:08,050
as a volunteer so there are a lot of

00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:11,680
other different ways how you can

00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:13,540
contribute and benefits for that of

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,880
course everyone is looking for

00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:18,100
is first of all you can fold open wide

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,170
expert you can learn the distribution

00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,980
you can learn approaches that I'm

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:27,670
talking that I was talking about you can

00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:30,040
learn the work flow broach and now

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,620
continuous integration upgrade path tool

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,890
and eventually if you will contribute

00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:38,980
you will get Drupal or credits and can

00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:41,800
it's on the Drupal at work and the next

00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,630
one you can keep the momentum and based

00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,490
on this get new clients your

00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:49,030
organization because in case if you an

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:52,240
open white expert or your organization

00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:55,240
has been contributed to the open by some

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,480
specific teacher you can just go to YMCA

00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,180
and say hey I'm an expert in the

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,700
integration with XML and I would like to

00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,460
build new website based on open why

00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:10,960
because we have that feature accepted in

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:15,670
there so we are we are like happy to

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,920
help with that so and eventually at the

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,530
end of the presentation I would like to

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,720
say thank you to the whole team so we

00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,870
have a lot of different folks who is not

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,540
here and I just represent the whole team

00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:31,570
that we may see on the slide thank you

00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:37,720
very much for all your work for all your

00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:39,970
effort and who knows maybe here right

00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,620
now we have the new contributors and you

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,310
team members who will contribute to the

00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:47,950
project so as I mentioned our next focus

00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,920
is building the community so based on

00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,870
this I would like to invite you to

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,600
Friday screens we will have first time

00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,210
sprinter workshop and general sprints

00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:02,200
and we will have we will have the open

00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:06,730
wide sprint track at the general sprint

00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,890
on Friday so please evaluate our session

00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,720
this is really important to get some

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,330
feedback there is just quick link you

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,580
can open it and leave a comment thank

00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:17,660
you very much that the time for the

00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:24,039
questions

00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:26,269
[Applause]

00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:32,109
this looks really really fabulous I've

00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:35,419
built something similar for the ACLU so

00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:37,819
so it seems that the the distribution

00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:39,729
focuses mainly on like the content

00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:43,449
modeling and evidence content for

00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:45,319
specific to the YMCA and then the

00:48:43,449 --> 00:48:47,659
integrations with the third-party

00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:49,579
services when you were when you're

00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:51,969
thinking about you know how to approach

00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:54,019
this problem did you consider it all

00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:55,640
maybe building on top of another

00:48:54,019 --> 00:49:02,839
distribution that might handle some of

00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:06,140
the kind of like the lower-level y-yeah

00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,969
so when we started building the

00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,679
distribution so the question was let me

00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:10,759
just repeat the question question was if

00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,339
we were looking at the other

00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:15,829
distributions when we started building

00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:18,019
built in why so there were a chance to

00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:21,019
build Appa Moya on top of some

00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:23,599
distribution right so we were looking at

00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:28,759
the Lightning add OpenSocial

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:33,399
and the next the another one the Thunder

00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:36,049
right so Thunder distribution but we

00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:39,349
didn't want to have a dependencies on

00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:42,409
something that is out of our control

00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:45,019
because we may have some crazy ideas

00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:48,380
that will not work with those

00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:51,229
distributions and it was easier to

00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,299
create everything from scratch because

00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:55,880
we've had a lot of different websites on

00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:58,749
Drupal and we've had a lot of different

00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,899
features of come down so we were just

00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:05,929
working with those contributors with

00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:08,929
those open why's we were taking features

00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:11,839
from there and we were adding them to

00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:14,269
the fresh Drupal 8 installation and then

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,699
on top of this we just put our custom

00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:21,499
theme so that's everything what we've

00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:23,689
done and yeah so we we were looking at

00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:26,120
some distributions but we are not using

00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:28,790
them we are building our sometimes claim

00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:33,550
and then kind of similarly to that did

00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:36,530
you consider like pulling away than on

00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,850
the stuff that isn't specific to the

00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,680
wife pulling that into a separate

00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,300
distribution of your own this is more

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,750
generic and than just having a second

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,570
distribution that's office so that's

00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:51,080
good idea but I think actually maybe we

00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:53,300
will get some point to the place maybe

00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,880
in Wizard we will have just to select

00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,340
which features you would like to see we

00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,040
will have the groups for example those

00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:04,820
are for small wineries for big waves is

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,410
for medium ideations maybe in case if

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,110
you will install the distribution you

00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:10,310
will find something for your nonprofit

00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:14,480
organization even though you are not

00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:17,090
YMCA but try now our focus is just these

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,990
two groups and for YMCAs correct correct

00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,790
me if i'm wrong

00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,380
yeah I think that's a I want to go back

00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,660
to the first point when we started

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,280
building this it was reactor Drupal 8

00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,780
had been released and so there weren't a

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,790
ton of distributions as well and we

00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,950
wanted to be on eight for future growth

00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:34,070
and that was part of what went with that

00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:37,100
as well regarding would we ever get to a

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:39,290
point where we we decouple the YMCA

00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,270
specific parts and have a version that

00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,270
you could say I'm just a non-profit I

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,980
for anybody in the world and I want to

00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,620
use this distribution but I'm not a YMCA

00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,820
that is very much the long-term plan of

00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,920
this we'd like to see that happen

00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,720
we would love it if more people use the

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,910
distribution provide us with feedback so

00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,670
we can make it better for everybody

00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:00,170
that's being mission driven as part of

00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,150
the whole movement of open wide making

00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,880
this something that could help everybody

00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:09,110
out I've got more questions but I think

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,350
a little comfort yeah I like how you

00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:15,170
approach they have a great dashboard and

00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,780
it's beneficial for like a different

00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:21,330
distributions do you have any plans of

00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:24,690
making it generic for other distribution

00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:27,240
yeah so actually this is the component

00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:30,800
again that the component of our system

00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:34,260
this is a custom module that is used

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,680
that is using I guess one country module

00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,420
so it's really easy way to make it the

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,090
complete module and contribute to Drupal

00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,400
the doric but I think we just need a

00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,250
little bit more time in order to do that

00:52:44,400 --> 00:53:08,160
finally and maybe some volunteers who

00:52:47,250 --> 00:53:10,200
can do that and so the question if we

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,330
are using any tools for the continuous

00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,460
integration sport now we are a def of w

00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:19,980
we built the skybox

00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,530
continuous integration open source

00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:25,710
project and this continuous integration

00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:27,590
was built on top of the c a box there

00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:31,410
are a lot of customization because

00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:33,990
building usual Drupal website it's much

00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:36,150
easier than building something from the

00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:39,860
installation profile where you do not

00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:42,660
have the Drupal core you do not have the

00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,910
example doctor containers or something

00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:51,840
like crack runs we build that on top of

00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:53,970
a box so if if you think about what's

00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,230
involved in having a website you can

00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,570
break it down into kind of three

00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,310
different pieces like making like

00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,310
buildings building the website bringing

00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:03,720
your legacy content in and then ongoing

00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:08,280
support and maintenance for that site

00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:11,250
for that third piece like even for like

00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,370
that's a smaller why like this someone's

00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:17,880
got to be there to like upgrade to open

00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:20,580
why 1.1 or whatever is there something

00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,370
you know because it looks like they're

00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,530
all hosted on many different places is

00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,600
there some sort of

00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:29,870
system that can built-in or on top of

00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:32,930
this it kind of fitted it makes that

00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:35,710
whole process easier or consistent

00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:39,440
across the whole organization yep so

00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:43,310
yeah the question is if we like provide

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,590
any tools in order to support different

00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:48,320
instances of the website and there are a

00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:51,950
lot of different all NCA's so I just

00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:56,510
have to like repeat the question for the

00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:58,820
recording so in the long-term run under

00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:01,040
the hood of that wizard that you've seen

00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:04,160
for the non-technical installation I

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,950
guess we may have some kind of platform

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:10,820
we will support the small lime series

00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:14,930
that do not have IT department in order

00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:17,570
to work on some infrastructure for the

00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:20,000
website so that could be like beneficial

00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:22,550
for small and maybe medium Lansky's to

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,710
have that tool so there could be

00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,920
dedicated team who will support those

00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:29,930
websites who will support upgrade paths

00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,390
will support all those completes that we

00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:37,700
may see in depth with that dashboard

00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:39,380
that that's only kind of idea that maybe

00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,980
at some point we will get to that and

00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,560
for conduct or we will have like that

00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,100
ones that will be their main priority

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,900
okay great

00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,940
yeah thanks jumping on that as well you

00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,910
hit on the last mile right I'm a small

00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,980
YMCA great I want to use open why what

00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,720
do I do next right I can't I can't

00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,540
afford a hundred thousand dollar web

00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,100
host what am I going to do so we've been

00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,960
talking to or what we've been doing is

00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,420
talking with some of the larger YMCAs

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,490
and looking at pooling our resources to

00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,200
build such a platform potentially in

00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,770
partnership with FSL bu or another

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,420
agency maybe aqueon Theon there's some

00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,730
they're a couple of organizations that

00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,860
are to eat service nonprofits in that

00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,990
regard providing 24/7 support ongoing

00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,990
updates etc but there has to be

00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:26,150
something that is very cost effective

00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,740
for those small YMCAs we believe that

00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,390
there are a few out there we connect

00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,900
it's YMCAs with partners that can do

00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:34,160
that in the interim because these YMCAs

00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,140
are all independently hosting their

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,140
sites today by making the distribution

00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,150
freely

00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,609
available to them we've removed that

00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:43,980
barrier for adoption of saying look you

00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:47,039
can use it as is on your current web

00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,779
server enter your lamp server etc or if

00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,829
you can wait a little bit of time we

00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:51,869
think that there might be some better

00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:53,609
options or other options that are more

00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:55,140
scalable and could keep everybody a

00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:58,410
little bit under the same house to make

00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:01,109
that upgrade path even easier and and

00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:02,819
what about that middle section Mike

00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:05,789
migrating might with my legacy content

00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:07,019
is there something built in this is more

00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,779
than more than just what's in Drupal 8

00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:11,789
cores yeah so the question is the

00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:13,859
migration of content right so there's a

00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:15,029
couple different paths one is as I

00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,109
mentioned earlier we're working with

00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:18,420
that Charter School in Minneapolis

00:57:16,109 --> 00:57:21,029
that's providing opportunities to 15 to

00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:23,010
19 year old students they get school

00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:24,990
credit etc we're working with them to

00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,299
build some of our demo content they also

00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:30,900
offer the ability to copy and migrate

00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:32,400
content over to open Y sites most of the

00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,710
smaller YMCAs will have anywhere from

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,450
only 50 to 100 pages what we are

00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,250
starting to focus on with the 1.1

00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:40,529
distribution is making it very easy to

00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:43,259
just copy and paste I'd like to see in

00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:45,029
the 1.2 and beyond effectively a machine

00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:48,240
learning based wizard where I can say

00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:51,329
here's my current site here's the new IP

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,220
address copy over my content get me 80

00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:54,809
to 90% of the way there where all I have

00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,880
to do is go through a massage a few

00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:59,549
things that's the long-term path we'd

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:04,440
like to see happen thank you thanks a

00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:05,670
lot thank you it's a great job I had a

00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,279
question on governance I know you

00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,690
mentioned collaboration but I guess how

00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:11,609
do you determine what gets billed you

00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,109
have a small organization has an ad they

00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:15,630
think it's really going to help them you

00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:17,099
have organizations the larger ones that

00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,380
have larger ass how do you prioritize

00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,990
that through something more specific

00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,009
than just collaboration absolutely so

00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,750
it's a great question how do we handle

00:58:23,009 --> 00:58:27,569
prioritization of our roadmap the

00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,009
features we go after etc pattern so we

00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:31,049
look at a variety of different things we

00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:33,599
look at what's the demand for the

00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:35,099
feature not just the size of the YMCA

00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,819
but how many people could this serve

00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:41,519
right regard you may be a large YMCA but

00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:43,500
maybe this feature only helps your small

00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,750
your market outfit isn't going to help

00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,849
the broader majority so we look at that

00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,009
as part of our decision-making process

00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:50,700
we look at what's the cost to build that

00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:52,860
new feature

00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,270
we look at how many YMCA is made that

00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,150
feature benefits not just the people

00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:59,430
they serve but there's four major CRM

00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:01,500
platforms that the 800 YMCA is the

00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:03,390
United States partner with the largest

00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:07,200
by far is Dax Cove we in the Twin Cities

00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:09,300
we use personify so it's I have to look

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,070
at what I want to go after personify

00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,390
integration and say you know what maybe

00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:15,060
some of those elements have to wait a

00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:17,430
little bit because 90% of the YMCA's are

00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,200
on Dax Coe and then the final element is

00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,120
just the overall level of effort how

00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,400
hard is it to build this thing is it

00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,690
really really easy is it hard we

00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,640
calculate all that we got a big

00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,650
spreadsheet with our entire backlog and

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,600
we use that to determine what should we

00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,610
be going after and then we review it on

00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,010
monthly calls with the YMCA's that are

00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,230
participating in open wide that 45 and

00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,190
growing list and say look here's what

00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,840
we're building here's what we're doing

00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:42,390
over the next few weeks next few months

00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,810
how do we feel about this and for the

00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:47,520
most part it's worked quite well not on

00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,950
the podium it seems to be working quite

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,540
well in that regard I anticipate at some

00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,190
point we will hit some conflicts where

00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,640
people will say you know I want this I

00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:59,160
want that and again we in my opinion

00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,470
data hopefully will trump emotions with

00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,510
some of those situations so it's a group

01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:05,220
of 45 then it's basically who's making

01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,550
these decisions based off you put the

01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:10,860
jeweler yeah so a few months ago we had

01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:13,320
a open Y summit in Houston it was open

01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,880
to agencies technology providers and at

01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,280
the time there's about twenty to thirty

01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,540
YMCAs if you come to those summits

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,760
that's where a lot of these big

01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:23,430
decisions get made we do two a year so

01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,650
for today there's 45 YMCAs over time

01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:29,220
that's going to grow hundreds and

01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:31,380
hundreds we hope and yes we want that

01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,880
feedback we need that feedback loop so

01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,920
we can continue to make the right

01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,960
decisions of what we're prioritizing and

01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:41,640
going after yeah welcome thank you I'm

01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,560
really curious about what you guys are

01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,140
doing for I mean you might have touched

01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,120
on this feature but are you providing

01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,980
any features dealing with commerce I

01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,810
mean you got memberships you've got

01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,730
people making purchases right at the

01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:56,580
counter is this a third party

01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:58,320
integration or you guys actually have

01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:01,009
this tool as a feature in the

01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,239
distribution

01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:05,009
so the question is do we have the

01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:07,140
ability to integrate with Commerce that

01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:08,849
is exactly why we chose Drupal and we

01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,789
were looking at what platform to go down

01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:14,640
WordPress or Drupal was the ability to

01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:17,759
do ecommerce long term right now at one

01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,099
point oh no right it's just effectively

01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:22,019
a marketing website long term it has to

01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:23,819
do he calms that's exactly what we want

01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:25,799
to go after as I mentioned there's those

01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:27,449
four CRM platforms that we need to

01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:29,549
integrate with independently because

01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:32,069
that's the effectively the point-of-sale

01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:33,269
terminal at these YMCAs so like like I

01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:35,729
said we use personify in the Twin Cities

01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:37,529
a lot of them are using taxco so first

01:01:35,729 --> 01:01:39,630
we have to build those hooks those API

01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:41,309
integrations in need to make sure that

01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:43,890
everything we're doing is PCI compliant

01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:46,079
and then start whittling away at

01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:50,189
ecommerce that absolutely is the is the

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,449
long term vision of this awesome that's

01:01:50,189 --> 01:01:53,320
everybody's questions thank you again

01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:59,879
everybody for the time

01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:59,879
