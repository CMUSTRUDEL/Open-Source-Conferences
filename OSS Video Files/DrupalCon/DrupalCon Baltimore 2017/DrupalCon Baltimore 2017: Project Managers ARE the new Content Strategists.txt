Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Project Managers ARE the new Content Strategists
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	Being a great project manager is more than just timelines, budgets, scope, and knowing something about Agile. It’s about being the first player off the bench, the secret weapon, the switch-hitter. Our job is to fill in where needed to keep the project on track, help our team, and mitigate that darn risk. Our job is to be content strategists!

That’s right – content strategists! After managing Drupal projects for over eight years, I have learned that two things hold true – content is the number one reason projects are delayed and nobody has money to pay for a content strategist (not yet at least!). I promise you that I am not delusional. This is never going to be our full-time jobs but we can make a difference.

During this session we will walk through the discovery, design, and build phases of a website redesign sharing tips, tools, and examples of steps you can take to manage the content process and provide your clients with ways to create better content. All of these steps keep in mind that you are already completely busy with your normal project management duties. We will talk audits, editorial guidelines, purging rules, tools, testing, governance, and more!

By the end, you will walk away empowered to take on this new role.

all right I think we're going to get

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,859
started two things should know I'm kind

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,830
of loud and I talk really fast when I

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,840
stand at a podium so apology if it goes

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,190
too fast like where's arms and throw

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,289
some at me if you want me to slow down

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,880
but how we're going to be talking about

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,330
project management and content strategy

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,320
today whoo-hoo-hoo in this room is a

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,849
project manager do you know they're

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,060
never used to be a project management

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,340
track years I would come I was so sad

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,020
this is awesome so here too I'm super

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,550
excited and then anyone that didn't

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,960
raise their hand we just know that you

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,660
want to be like us love progress all

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,430
right so if you care to do it it really

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,050
helps me when you tweet stuff out that

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,149
gives me a sense of when you guys kind

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,770
of like something or something sticks so

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,320
it's a good way to give me feedback on

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,480
hashtag obviously DrupalCon my twitter

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,180
handle is lynn winter and then because

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
i'm from minnesota and i waited way too

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,230
long to get my twitter handle but you

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,239
should also know that means it's the

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,189
first time I brought my legs out since

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,590
the summer so don't stare directly at

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,060
them I'll try to stay behind the podiums

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,250
are really white and then harnesses and

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,119
German so they're a little scary to look

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,680
at so my name is Lynn and I work at a

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,159
company called August ash for a

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,259
20-person agency in Minneapolis I have a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,360
job called a production director which

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,159
is kind of made-up but it basically

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,930
means that I'm in charge of a team of

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,939
people that build and maintain websites

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,810
so that includes project managers

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,400
front-end back-end design and UX and we

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,070
do all the maintenance in the building

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,720
of the new sites but I think it'd be

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,299
helpful to take a little step back and

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,270
see where I came from and why this topic

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,049
is really passionate for me I started at

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,060
PBS down like at G PBS but a PBS

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,549
affiliate in Minnesota it was called

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,840
Twin Cities Public Television they went

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,570
through our branding right when I

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,130
started and they called it TPT which the

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,979
public thing called toilet paper

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,630
television so since then they've gotten

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,460
rid of it but I lived with that for all

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,039
eight years I was there with it was

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,110
amazing but I spent eight years there

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,870
had multiple titles but basically I was

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,250
a project manager loved it people knew

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,500
what that role was there was very

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,319
established they knew what to come to me

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,610
for then you had hide from me but it was

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,590
worse that's it and I appreciate that

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,420
and I think that's because it's been

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,150
around for so long

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,280
television was invented in 1927 so there

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,629
was a person before me and a person

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,760
before that and the person before that

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:38,159
and a person for that and so I wasn't

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,440
making the role up then comes 2008 Jesus

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,510
links to feel kind of old but I went to

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,099
this company there was four people there

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,260
and I joined them and I was the only

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,120
project manager and it was great it was

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,769
really small I got to do a lot of

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,620
different things I got to do some user

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:55,739
experience some content strategies some

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,049
user testing QA work and then of course

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,569
project management and it gave me a lot

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:03,650
of experience but it was kind of hard

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:06,870
because it wasn't a really clear role

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,390
Drupal was released in 2001 which seems

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,609
like eons ago but it really wasn't that

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,879
long ago if you think about our role

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:17,579
we're literally defining it right now it

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,160
hasn't had that link and so I struggled

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,590
with that for a long time I mean I got

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,660
my job because they took literally took

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,579
two people and there's someone here that

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,680
used to work with me but they took two

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,799
people job and they wrote down all the

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,569
crap they hated they literally wrote

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,660
down all the crap they did right and

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,549
they made a job and I looked at stuff

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,829
but my role is the things that people

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,359
didn't like to do so it's kind of hard

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,250
it was kind of hard to find my people -

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,139
I was at Drupal cons like going oh

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,629
you're a project manager and I'd be

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,430
running across the room be my friend

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,829
let's talk that stuff it's a little

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,799
awkward at first but like look at us now

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,569
so there's been a lot of growth so it

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,109
was hard for me to figure out what my

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,060
role should become and then I realized

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:06,480
stop you being a baby about it and

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,120
realize that we can do anything we

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
literally can do anything right now with

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,139
our role we can be anything we want to

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,359
be there are so many things going on and

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,370
anywhere you work you can kind of

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,709
stretch the roll to make that big impact

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,599
so if you don't walk away being

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,520
convinced about content strategy and how

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,080
that's part of your job going forward at

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,900
least think about how you

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,169
would want to make your job evolve how

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,240
can we change it over time for me it was

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,909
thinking about what made my clients

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,909
happy happy clients and happy projects

00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:41,520
meant happy team so on and so forth and

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:45,300
I kind of had a moment maybe four years

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,759
ago or like duh we're not getting many

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,969
of our products done in time because we

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,259
can't get our content written clients

00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,939
aren't getting their content done and

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,229
we're stuck we're running over time

00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,659
lines aren't happening everyone's

00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:00,509
starting to get crabby so how can I fix

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,159
this and so I decided to get more

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,139
involved and figuring out what content

00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,030
strategy was and how I could bring that

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,949
into our process because it turns out we

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,349
were a small company and nobody else was

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,909
super passionate about it as time went

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,430
on there's multiple people that kind of

00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:16,050
did it but this is the thing is the bulk

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,210
of content strategy today is not about

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,639
writing content it's about project

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,500
managing content and that's what we do

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,909
so I wanted to walk through nine

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,860
different things that I think have been

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,689
the challenges clients have over time

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,669
and then some of the solutions that we

00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,069
can do to solve them and they will run

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,860
from like the start of a web project all

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,110
the way to the end of it so the first

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,629
challenge is is that the clients are

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,430
lost they don't know where to start and

00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,349
they don't know what path to follow

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,120
think about it if you guys ever read

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,440
content strategy books to start

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,270
following blogs there's all these

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,919
different techniques and tools and

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,050
things out there and it's really

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,089
overwhelming and then go say hey client

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,469
go do that thing it's overwhelming to

00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,839
them what we need to do is put blinders

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,449
on and then show them the exact direct

00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,310
path that we want them to go down so

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,080
really the solution to that is that we

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,479
as the project managers are the leaders

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,819
we're going to get out front of them and

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,699
take that down them down that path and

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,250
dry them the direction we want them so

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,659
what does that mean well I think the

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,139
first thing is you have to figure out

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:24,000
what your MVP MVP process is see I'm

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,879
talking so fast to be so MVP you process

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,830
we want to be over where it's the

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,069
ultimate the Utopia the best content

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,690
strategy possible but its 2017 and we're

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,339
not there and we need to all cut

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,440
ourselves some slack that were not there

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,910
now what we need to be doing is figure

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,770
out with very minimal

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,930
things you need to do to make the

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,120
project successful and after you do that

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,680
a couple times add the next layer on add

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,390
the next layer on and then over the

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,460
years we're going to get to kind of the

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,440
Tokyo land so figure out with your

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,480
projects where I used to work all of my

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,960
projects were six figures enough where

00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm at now I'm with 20 to 80 thousand is

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,750
more where our sweet spot is and so the

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,480
process I have is very different based

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,240
on who my client is now so kind of think

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,800
about your situation what makes sense

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,380
part of that process is providing very

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,940
clear boundaries and so if that's not

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,550
something you've been doing for a while

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,190
I encourage you to make it up and here's

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,230
why is we have experience we're going

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,350
and doing all these projects we know

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,810
better than our clients are so through

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,060
the process for example when we get to a

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,370
kickoff meeting we say hey you know what

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,720
I want you to get me all the names of

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,920
people in your content team I want to

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,990
make sure there's at least three people

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,670
on there ok now you're going to meet

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,560
every single week you got it you got it

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,730
special ok now we're going to look

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,840
through your content I want you to cut

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,450
50% yes

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,360
50% so you have 300 pages give me 150

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,910
whatever it is just make very clear

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,310
rules and they will follow that having

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,890
ambiguity is what drives like the

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,080
process to go all off page the other

00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,750
thing is don't worry about the cost and

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,480
time is going to take upfront the hours

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,950
that you spend 10 20 hours of front

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,110
you'll save that when the project

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,160
doesn't go over the timeline by 2 3

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,230
months you're going to waste that time

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,880
anyway if you can get upfront and the

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,620
clients kind of grooving and on board

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,750
with you you're going to have a wash and

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,570
money overtime until of course you keep

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,669
adding to your process so that's the

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,650
best thing is as the project manager we

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,630
can lead them and give them the Zach

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,020
path and it's whatever path you define

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,190
is the right path for your project

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,980
challenge number two is that they don't

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,960
have a time nor do they have experience

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,360
right I'm not a writer I can't start

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,580
writing things and I don't have time and

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,160
the solution for that is really we need

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,990
to hire talent and it doesn't have to be

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,410
overwhelming where we think oh we have

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,690
to have a writer great $10,000 we can

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,760
just have hire a writer to copyright

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,760
edit we can hire a writer to write the

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,800
first 10 samples that we can think

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,720
copy from there's different ways to do

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,330
it but we need to be hiring some folks

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,310
and the reason is is the average person

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,830
works 47 hours and you little

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,640
overachievers in the room for a ton of

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,800
you work 50 so if someone is added our

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,480
clients are busy all day long and then

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,790
they say okay now we'll write stuff and

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,560
do all this work unless their role is to

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,720
do this which is probably not the case

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,090
for most of our situations they don't

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,280
have the time to do it and on top of it

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,170
they're not experts they don't go take

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,270
pictures they don't shoot video they

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,000
don't write content and having you know

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,770
Bob and accounting or I know a friend

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,420
from high school or that kind of thing

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,170
that's not going to get us where we want

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,820
to get so we need to invest and we can

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,290
prove that there's a lot of stats out

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,080
there that say that investing in content

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,520
marketing will lead to more leads get

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,650
them where they need to get and spend

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,140
less money over time so it's well worth

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,210
investing and writing the other thing we

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,940
can't forget about though is the visuals

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:57,470
right that's much more impactful these

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,830
days than anything video 74% is the web

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,820
content we consume and so we can't just

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,770
be think you know we're gonna have a

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,780
pretty video background on our banner

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,460
that's nice but we need to be

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,900
incorporating that video into unique

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,790
pieces of content of content we're

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,770
constantly pushing out so we need to

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,940
have a budget for that or we need to be

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,950
thinking about all these other tools

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,620
like periscope or Facebook live the

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,940
things just pick up a phone and get some

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,850
content out there but we have to have

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,430
that in our plan we also need to be

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,200
thinking about articles with images when

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,570
you're on Facebook right when it doesn't

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,830
have an image now who I'm just past that

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,870
I don't even think about it now they

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,810
added that beautiful like full colored

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,100
box of the text over it they caught me

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,740
again even though I don't like how that

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,720
looks but it pulls us in we want

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,840
something visual it turns out you get

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,720
94% more clicks it's a no-brainer

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,370
there's a lot of free video less free

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,080
video but a lot of free images out there

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,180
like all my pictures came from those

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,580
sources that people can use so that's a

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,110
great start but a photographer can be

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,320
three four five hundred dollars for

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,600
minimal work also we don't want to

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,850
forget about graphics design eighty

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,330
eight hundred percent over the last year

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,570
which is kind of mind-blowing to me

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,710
but you know icons or infographics those

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,210
are kind of things that we want to

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,930
incorporate into our design and keep

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,560
them fresh challenge number three is

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,390
they have no clue what they have anymore

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,980
and that's just the case and mostly when

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,160
your site gets really old that people

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,870
stop investing in it both

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,910
technology-wise and content so they kind

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,650
of don't know what's there so we're

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,180
going to do the old content inventory

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,480
how many people have done one of those

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:42,190
before huh keep your hands up how many

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,170
people like them still oh so I think

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,700
that's part of like to be a project and

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,590
adjust content strategy you have to kind

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,720
of get into it and it can be a little

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,150
hard I've done anywhere from fifty pages

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,010
to twenty thousand so I hate twenty

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,710
thousand I'm feeling better about one

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,720
thousand but it is a lot of work the

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,310
nice fun thing is is when you make all

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,870
these decisions and help the client with

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,210
them you can kind of impact the

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,290
navigation and the UX of the site and it

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,130
gets you a little more involved in the

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,840
creative which I like when we do

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,460
inventories so we try to do this before

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,310
the kickoff meeting so that we have a

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,100
sense of what they have going right now

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,990
before we even meet with them but we do

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,580
an inventory and work with the client

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,560
when it's a certain size so when it's

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,210
medium to large we work with the client

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,530
when it's a really really small site we

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,330
just kind of make the decisions on our

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,220
own and move on because usually those

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,680
are less sophisticated clients or

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,990
sophisticated means not always but tends

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,220
to mash up a little bit so let's break

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,470
down the roles of who should be doing

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,260
what so our role is to create the

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,910
document we like to use blue sheets that

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,710
way we can share it within our team and

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,450
we can share it with our clients we put

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,660
everything in there you know the typical

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,750
stuff the name of the page the URL you

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,000
know item with notes about it different

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,380
things I do skip numbering if you look

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,360
these things up most these content

00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,680
inventory number things the problem is

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,570
every time you move something your

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,920
numbering systems off so I just skip it

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,250
because you have numbers within the

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,870
sheets or Excel anyway so we'll do that

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,550
then we're going to add notes about the

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,070
features I like the color code them so

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,930
I'll make one color code like yellow

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,730
will be if it's an internal thing we

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,080
need to talk about I got questions for

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,080
the developer I want to point this out

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,769
to the user experience person all makes

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,269
eye color yeah

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,100
hello then I'll make it blue if I have a

00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,869
question the client like what is this or

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,730
are you guys doing this anymore

00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,989
right it's not very clear to be so I'll

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,730
make it a different color so I can

00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:33,550
easily scan it which is helpful when you

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,230
get a bigger size inventory on the third

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,480
thing is I like to make a quick

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,309
evaluation I will literally write into a

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,959
column if we're going to keep it or

00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,939
delete it and it's a bright red color

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,999
and I write delete and I write why I'm

00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:47,980
going to delete it or I write keep turns

00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,720
out when I started doing that I was

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,639
really afraid that people would kind of

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,170
get annoyed with it or it was their

00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,179
little baby and it hurt their feelings

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,980
I've gotten feedback from clients over

00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,299
and over that thank you it made it

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,249
really clear to us we didn't have to

00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:01,749
argue about internally so it gave them

00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,699
kind of a stepping stone so I find that

00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,139
most people just kind of stick with it I

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,939
find I'm working with right now a school

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,589
district it's very cute they broke it

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:09,850
into different pieces because like nine

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,850
different people reviewed it and they

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,589
but they wrote in their own challenge

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,449
they want to challenge me on it which i

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,249
think is awesome so that it goes to show

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,559
that you have that authority I just

00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:23,709
would rooms again that's got to go for

00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,629
reasons right but they're very listening

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,389
to me and want to challenge it have a

00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,369
conversation so that's always helpful

00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,410
and then analyze the data so if you're

00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,600
really into google analytics go to town

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,790
get a lot of data put it in there if

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,160
you're not what I would just do is look

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,079
at your top hundred pages or where it

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,910
really drops into nothing and just write

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,829
into a column how many people are

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,779
visiting ten percent one percent because

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:48,610
when you start evaluating all the other

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,920
reasons like is anyone use it do you

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,829
need it for your initiative that traffic

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,230
really helps with on if that makes sense

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:58,149
what I need them to do is I want them to

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,339
look at the list can they ask can I

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,559
actually just get rid of it it probably

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,360
should check that school district I was

00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,689
talking about they had things about pest

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,279
control on the website again gone never

00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:11,529
looked at the best control in my kids

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,449
school but they have to have it there

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,889
for funding reasons or something so they

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,059
they have to have it on there and so

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,459
what they did is they also updated

00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:20,739
because it was two years old so they

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,269
made that change on their live site so

00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:24,189
they need to review that they also need

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,169
to scurry around their offices and find

00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,459
out what's new I have no clue what new

00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:29,470
contents and they're making that they're

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,819
not putting on the website so I need

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,180
them to look through that and send that

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,770
to me

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,020
other images or their videos or their

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,280
newsletters what's out there so we have

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,500
a good sense and I was a project manager

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,680
and gather that together and hand off to

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,910
the user experience person also they

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,290
should be in charge of who's going to

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,910
own the content whether they're going to

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,100
write it or they're responsible for

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,110
getting it done they need to assign that

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,910
because I don't know their organization

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,700
well enough so they have to pick that

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,370
and finally they also need to prioritize

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,830
for launch I have maybe worked on one

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,230
website that was big you know bigger

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:06,640
than 10 pages that got their content

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,200
done on time it just doesn't happen and

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,020
I was pretty floored when it actually

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,760
did because they had a sizable thing but

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,360
they have to prioritize we're not going

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,160
to get there

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,320
so what do you want to get done and what

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,510
are we going to let go of it's also a

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,790
great message to be passing on I like to

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,710
do it as a beginning like in a sales

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,270
team can kind of mention that and then

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,190
also at the start of the kickoff meeting

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,510
hopefully their boss is in the room so

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,250
they don't get pressured just to start

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,180
copying and pasting ground because

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,770
that's what happens if I fall behind

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,100
they're like oh I'll just copy that like

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,920
oh don't do it and then you get the same

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,510
crap over and over so it's good to keep

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,330
make that message really clear in the

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,340
beginning so here's an example

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,900
my inventories tend to look slightly

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,120
different every time I don't know why

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,290
maybe I just like to change it up but

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,660
you can see the biggest thing that

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,690
stands out to you is the column of go

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,130
away keep or a couple of things I put in

00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,710
orange because I really just didn't know

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,540
what what it was there for so that's

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,430
what we use and they took and they

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,800
divided a science thing up and just gave

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,240
us some feedback a couple days ago when

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,390
we're done with this the project

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,090
managers work with the client and then

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,760
when you get then final navigation we

00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:19,210
clean it all up and then put it into the

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,680
right navigation order so the URLs are

00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,450
really going to be for reference that's

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,460
what it currently says just so you can

00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,020
reference it while you're writing but we

00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,520
pull out all the things we're going to

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,650
get rid of and we start categorizing

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,510
what type of content they're going to be

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,810
in this document so we can get our kind

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,420
of full scope list so that's really the

00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:41,350
inventory the challenge number four is

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:44,550
they can't say goodbye is very hard to

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,500
get rid of content I don't think it's a

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,570
much is like oh I wrote it I feel bad as

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,040
much as I'm overwhelmed and I don't have

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,010
time to do this and it probably doesn't

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,530
matter and so I think it's important we

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,820
help give an understanding of why you

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,850
should get rid of things and why you

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,400
should keep them so one idea is for

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,560
project managers provide defining the

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,560
value what makes a piece of content

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,150
valuable so what I did is I wrote up a

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,490
document to actually share which is

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,560
great because it turns out that a lot of

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,020
people that I'm us will go over the

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,700
activity are not in the room Oh what we

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,790
decided to hand that off to this person

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,980
and this person like Oh super hope they

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,990
know what to do so this document will

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,280
lay that out and it has six different

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,740
points and I'll walk through those

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,390
points but I think the key is what are

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,560
the right points for you and then I

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,030
would encourage it to be written it

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,520
doesn't need to be in a fancy document

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,770
but somebody an email something that can

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,240
be shared I also be extremely happy to

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,620
share this with someone and grab my

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,990
business card after we're and I can send

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:47,010
it over if that's helpful so here's the

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:50,040
six items one is useful is the audience

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,980
coming to that website to get what they

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,050
need are you the authority on it as well

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,570
as is this a key initiative as a client

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,620
that you want to be pushing out if it's

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:04,350
not it's probably taking up space hasn't

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,660
been updated recently hasn't been

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,940
updated in a year ask yourself why and

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,830
why will that change if it's not going

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,350
to change it's better be something like

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,770
an old blog post or a news item or

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,550
something that is passed dated is it

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,410
accurate

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,060
you want to make sure that you are

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,560
credible on the site especially if you

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,240
have any medical information financial

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,240
something that people are making

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,010
decisions we worked on a website for an

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,030
AIDS organization in Minnesota and they

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:35,790
have a page called HIV 101 now it wasn't

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,950
updated for a long time things changed

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,480
in that space new information is found

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,670
out and they should really have that

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,990
updated all the time otherwise they

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,580
shouldn't be the source for that they

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,420
should be driving people other places

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:50,880
for that does each piece of content have

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,880
an owner if it doesn't have an owner it

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,990
gets thrown away right off the bat

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
someone should stand up and think it

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,980
matters and if they don't it's never

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,440
going to be maintained

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,950
or created and perfectly of the other

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,799
pieces so it goes away we're in a mobile

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,799
world right is this content going to be

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,190
digestible on our small devices and an

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,630
enjoyable way are there diagrams or

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,510
grass or things that are going to make

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,910
it really difficult to use how long am I

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,440
going to be scrolling is there clear

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,000
ways for important information they're

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,370
going to be called out that pop out to

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,400
me so we got to think about if this is

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,830
going to be really mobile compatible and

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,260
finally traffic is anyone going to it

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,000
and you know the kind of hard part is

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,040
when you do this and it's an old site

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,040
you find that most of the content is it

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,390
being got to but that doesn't mean it

00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,970
has to be thrown away because it still

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,740
might be important I worked years ago

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,410
with the Science Museum of Minnesota and

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,900
they had about 1,500 pages and they cut

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,090
it by about 60% which is awesome

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,520
what they found is they had so many

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,960
layers and deep but they had really

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,580
critical information about their

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,650
exhibits and they have exhibits that

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,690
come and go and but they have exhibits

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,309
that stay all the time and so what they

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,650
decided to do is on that third level

00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:08,809
they took all the content that was just

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,640
lucky stuff and just filler and they

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,990
took it away so they dropped like 85

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,419
percent of that content and they took

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,190
about 15% and then moved it up to the

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,320
second level and I just kind of made it

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,910
called out and really critical and so

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,710
they just realized no one's going to

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,870
that even if I change what this looks

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,820
like or how it says they're still not

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,220
going that deep how do I pull that up

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,350
and if that's a great way to think about

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,790
that problem that if there is content

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,040
that's not getting visited but it's a

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,580
key initiative how do we pull it up and

00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,309
make it more meaningful challenge number

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,500
five they forget about the ongoing

00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,390
content means basically this entire

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,190
process is focusing on what do you have

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,240
now and what are you going to write in

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,620
the future and a lot of what you're

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,429
going to write in the future is probably

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,110
more static stuff and this is how are we

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:55,549
going to constantly be marking ourselves

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,950
and making new content and I think

00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,200
honestly I think we forget about this a

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,790
lot I'm super guilty about this it's

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,590
hard to think about and talk about in

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,620
that time you have just to build this

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,960
new website so the soutien is is we

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,950
should start talking about upcycling has

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,950
anyone heard this term before

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,430
so this is new to me but when I walk

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,950
through this I think you'll be like oh

00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:21,050
yeah because I heard this eight months

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,220
ago and when I was you know watched a

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,540
video and explained I'm like oh this

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,730
makes perfect sense

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,490
so what upcycling is is that you take

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,400
one really good solid piece of content

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,920
you break it up you push it out on

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,470
different channels and you repurpose it

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,720
so each thing you push is really strong

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,980
but you push it out smart time so that

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,190
you can have the greatest amount of

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,800
impact so let's think about this in an

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,400
example so take them I think I haven't

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,340
gone to the bay yet the bay is that way

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,870
the water is that way it's one direction

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,940
this way that way so we go to the water

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,740
we take a big boulder and we're going to

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,080
chuck it in the water right and what

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,730
happens is is that we get big rings

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,740
right we all does this as a kid like

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,600
watching the rings go out and so before

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,100
those rings dissipate we're going to

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,840
throw another one out in a different

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,670
spot and then those are going to come

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,770
out and essentially as we keep throwing

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,580
these rocks the impact gets bigger and

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,650
bigger and bigger so how to do this well

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,210
the reason also why we would want to do

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,530
this is essentially it should save time

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,179
and money it's going to be hard right

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,940
off the bat but if you have to produce

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,500
one big concept either every two weeks

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,260
every four weeks you only got to do it

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,750
once and so it should save some time and

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,309
money eventually we're also recognizing

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,050
that people aren't just coming to your

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:37,730
website to read stuff people are going

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,050
to social media to read stuff and

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,970
hopefully they're coming back to your

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,290
website but that's where they're going

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,720
so we need to make sure that we're

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:49,130
making stuff for that space that drives

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,020
us back it also forces us to make really

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,429
good content to start with so we can't

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,890
just kind of like oh goodness it's

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:57,260
publish it out there oh no one-size

00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:00,679
that's great all that time we're really

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,110
forced to do that in planning so what

00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,970
this might look like so we want to make

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,650
a video right we're going to create a

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,630
video super easy right we can all make

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,950
really fancy videos let's just say we

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,179
can we're going to throw it up on

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,950
YouTube and they have a nifty little

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,410
button to get the transcript from it

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,840
sure to get all the caption to audio

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,550
right in your little hand your take

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,740
stuff you're gonna make a blog post with

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,060
it so you've got your blog post you're

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,530
going to shorten it all up right because

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,690
it's super long and wordy

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,910
you're going to put titles to make it

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,220
really readable grab some images in

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,500
there throw that video in there and now

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,850
you've got a new blog post and you're

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,000
going to be driving people to the site

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,680
for that take that video as a next step

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,940
you're going to shorten them because

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,950
people won't really want to watch as

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,440
long as a video on Facebook you're going

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,120
to put captions on it because 85 percent

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,910
of the video watch on Facebook has no

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,950
sound they also have really nice feature

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,200
where you can put the caption frame by

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,030
frame to make sure that it flows really

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,060
well to the video and then you drive

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,320
people back to your website then you can

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,060
also be promoting this in your

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,100
newsletter and driving people to the

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,410
site just a short little snippet and

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,020
taking them there and then finally you

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,460
can make an Instagram quote card so you

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,010
want to make sure the content is

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,450
something that is substantial so maybe

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,400
like an e-book that could be broken a

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,110
series especially something that is

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,700
thought leadership like what is this

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,780
organization a company really known for

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:26,090
that somebody might be coming back for a

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,590
real example is Jamie Oliver in The

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,060
Naked Chef right he probably sits at

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,670
home all night and makes his Facebook

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,350
post he doesn't have anyone to do it so

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,750
he put a video up about the roasted

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:38,300
tomato soup on YouTube it's all up there

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,030
and then he also they've also made a

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,320
post on Facebook right with a picture

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,570
and they're going to drive people to the

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,870
website and then the website will have

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,950
the actual recipe so it's the same thing

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,840
different information on different

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,040
channels

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,990
another example is that's a science

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,810
museum that I was talking about they

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,370
always start their brand with a print

00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,900
they still have to send out a lot of

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,390
print and it's highly effective for them

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,100
so when they have a new exhibit they

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,050
come up with a video campaign and the

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,510
print campaign and it's all based on the

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,010
same imagery so they can use for

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,870
everything so you can see that the print

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,150
is on the left the video they have

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,820
rolling video on their banners for the

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,140
exhibit they also use that they started

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,270
with a bigger video that they put over

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,000
the airwaves and then they cut it down

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,890
to that and then they're also promoting

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,740
different pictures from the exhibit on

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,630
Facebook so it's kind of like stuff

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,760
you've all seen and I think it's helpful

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,910
if we put a name on it and then I think

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,230
the big thing here is as our job as

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,500
project managers that we need to be

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,330
talking about it

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,190
we don't lose that opportunity because a

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,330
website is just a website and the

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:47,700
marketing is what's driving them their

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:50,250
challenge ember six they are paralyzed

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,780
by the blank white page and I'll have

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,150
you guys ever in your past this told

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,470
people to start writing and like go

00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,510
write on a piece of paper and write

00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,250
content I used to do that and I feel

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,929
really bad about that now because I

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,840
don't know how they possibly did it but

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,700
they did so I think the challenge is for

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,220
us to break things down into as many

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,740
digestible pieces as we can and that's

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,760
not just a content but also the timeline

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,429
and deliverables for us so what we do is

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,230
after the site mount is made and the

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,659
wireframes are done the project manager

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,460
has a goal to get everything ready so

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,799
basically the tool they're going to

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,260
start writing content with one week from

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,659
the date of the wireframe so what they

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,510
do is come up with the unique types of

00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,780
content so as a blog as a news item item

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,850
is it a page at a school what are those

00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,650
pieces and then they're going to

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,419
finalize the full scope by the full

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,299
scope I mean the full list of pages

00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,820
right all the different things that they

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:51,870
need to be writing they're also going to

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,190
invent word limits because we probably

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,320
know better than clients do because

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,909
we're around it more often and clients

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,409
have a real struggle too saying how long

00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,470
do I write for I just have to fill this

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,000
in so we make up the word limit we do

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,409
that just based on our experience we

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,940
look at the wireframes and sometimes

00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:06,679
we'll look at competitors and see what

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,390
they're doing

00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:13,020
we're going to set some firm deadlines

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,059
so every single week we want to set X

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,409
amount of content to be written so on

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,480
and so forth so if you have a two month

00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:20,429
span we got to break that up because I

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,100
can't say go and then see you in two

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:25,679
months we need to break it into two tiny

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,659
little pieces every single week we're

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,770
also going to decide where that content

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,659
is created so when it's small we might

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,250
just be doing word document be just

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,320
adding it directly into Drupal we might

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,789
be using something else when it's bigger

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,809
we really like to use a tool called

00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,330
gather content anybody using that a

00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,049
couple people I love it you guys love it

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,210
okay good because I'm gonna talk about

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:49,799
it for a little bit so after that

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,580
wireframe meeting the project manager is

00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,710
going to grab that

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,000
at my site map that was wireframes and

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,440
they're going to start filling this out

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
and the best part about it is they're

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,010
going to be like wait a minute we don't

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,570
have a wireframe for that wait a minute

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,760
what's that we're missing that piece

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,409
missing that piece so they go meet with

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,450
a user experience person they sometimes

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,279
meet with a developer and they fill in

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,500
the pieces and so instead of waiting to

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,299
wear to the build portion and having all

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,340
these conversations we're flushing all

00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,980
that out right off the bat so gather

00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,950
content and get at gather content calm

00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,570
it cost about 80 dollars a month and you

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,539
can have 10 projects so if you're an

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,220
agency you can have up to 10 clients on

00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,720
it if you kind of want to ease your way

00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,389
in or if you're an internal project

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,830
manager the first month is free so most

00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:33,720
of our products right now complete

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,669
content creation in two to three months

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,010
so really you're paying maybe a hundred

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:40,380
and sixty bucks it's totally worth it it

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,960
is a tool that we can set up and we can

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,029
monitor what's going on and the client

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,190
can add content pass it back and forth

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,659
in their teams and put inline no it's

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,850
like you should add this here what about

00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,130
this so it's this really collaborative

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,200
tool it also critics with Drupal it's a

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,000
little picky about how we build Drupal

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,769
at our company but I know a lot of other

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,010
firms that use it and do the importance

00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:03,840
with it and it works just fine so the

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,519
first thing that we do is we set up the

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,470
templates so these are we're identifying

00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,419
all the different items that we're going

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,090
to be making content and unu unique

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,130
different pages so for this site we had

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,039
training classes we had a home page

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,860
we've got the donate page of staff BIOS

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,539
and so on and so forth so we make those

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,240
and we do that by on the left hand

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:26,490
column is all the flexible pieces so we

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,039
basically drag and drop as many things

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,990
as we want in and we titled the field we

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,690
can add text underneath it to describe

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,639
what it's about and then we also set

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,010
that fun word limit it also lets you do

00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:40,590
characters you want and what happens is

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,019
as the client is writing it turns red

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:47,000
and then they call you and say oh my god

00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:47,000
can I go over my word limit and we go

00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:52,169
yes you can do it and then they throw

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,519
really bad and they you don't do it they

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,710
kind of stick within it and that's how

00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,200
we get shorter and shorter more compact

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,500
I exercise awesome everyone feels really

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,140
bad and I love it so

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,679
you fill it out and then you create your

00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,750
templates and then you go and we now

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,580
make the navigation so everything on the

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,590
left is the navigation of the site so

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,909
we've taken the site map and we can put

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,679
it in there and you can put it in the

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:17,929
tree structure and then if you mess it

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,000
up you could drag and drop the item so

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,830
super easy to work with from that then

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,090
we assign the template so then the

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,260
client when they're coming in here

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,539
they're going to click what they want to

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,850
write the template will pop up to add

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,770
their content in and boom so now that

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,590
all the contents and tiny little pieces

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:35,120
for them we also have a due date so our

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,280
project managers break everything down

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,169
in the sign due days but we wait to do

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,400
that until after they've assigned who's

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,679
going to write because I don't want to

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,289
assign like ten pages the Molly and then

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,730
bob has like one so I want to wait for

00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:48,320
them to do that so we give them a

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,330
delivery date for assigning all the

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,059
content to the right people so we can

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,320
get through them oh you can also in the

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,059
right-hand corner to see when the last

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,250
time they updated something so you can

00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:02,510
catch them we're working on it no you're

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,919
not I see that that's the best part

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,650
about the tool I can actually see what

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,870
they're not doing you can also enter a

00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,669
workflow so here you can add any old

00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,770
workflow you want if you want to have

00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:14,510
multiple reviews one review if you need

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,460
a subject matter expert kind of

00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,929
reviewing certain page you can all add

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,120
that in there and it's completely

00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:23,330
editable and then finally the little

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,580
very simple status bar you can see where

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,710
you're at so say you've got a three

00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,539
month project or one month in we better

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,640
be one months into that continent reer

00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:33,500
we're all in trouble and so it allows

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,970
you to easily see that and I think it

00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,650
really makes people a lot more um

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,510
accountable for what they're supposed to

00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,980
be doing because usually there was no

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,450
visibility you get to the end and you're

00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,890
like you're not going to make it well

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,380
we're just a little behind how behind is

00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:50,030
like three months so I love this tool

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:52,039
challenge number seven the content maybe

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,570
isn't good enough for I am ever get

00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,169
content for your client to put in the

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,169
site and you're like

00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,920
that's not good or you get content you

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,050
think it's good and then you find out

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,780
later no one's getting the page right

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,790
there's a couple of things to do when we

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,250
ask our clients to deliver us 1 to 2

00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,110
samples of every unique template before

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,420
we start building and so that we can

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,300
build to that and we can also say oh

00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,970
look this isn't any good can I give you

00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,040
some direction it also is they've got to

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,140
get stuff done anyway so if we can front

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,370
load anything we can get that done and

00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,620
move on from there

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,930
so the way to figure this out is to

00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,740
teach testing anyone do user testing

00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,670
before awesome so it's really easy right

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,930
that's the best part about it I think

00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,400
that's the biggest barrier that it has

00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,410
to be complicated I've actually done

00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,420
like the lab testing which is ridiculous

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,980
by the way it cost like 20 grand kind of

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,780
fun but really weird you're sitting

00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,430
behind a wall and everything but you're

00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,980
not interacting so you don't get as good

00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,840
of information that way what I've also

00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,070
found over the years of doing it because

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,960
I've done lab testing I've done in

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,940
person and I've done online testing is

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,460
that I think the biggest problems we

00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,530
have is with the content not usually the

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,270
functionality not the UX and not the

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,670
design it's the content about tripping

00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,620
people up there just not comprehending

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,230
it and so we think it's important to do

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,820
some things in the three areas we can

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,370
kind of go through with our clients is

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,720
testing for readability testing for

00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,179
findability and testing for

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,830
comprehension and really as you go down

00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,990
it's really the more investment you have

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,360
so maybe your MVP process is just

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,399
starting with readability

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,140
so for readability it's important to

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,460
know this is essentially Ken someone

00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:34,280
read the text on the page right well 21%

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:40,460
of US adults read at a 5th grade level

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:44,360
or lower 5th grade that's it and 14% or

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,760
32,000,000 can't read at all so we're

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,520
making websites a fancy fancy fancy

00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,740
fancy that are really high level

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,230
education needs to be PhD and we're

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:58,430
losing people on top of it people that

00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,010
can read in easy way we don't want to

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,420
spend the time trudging through

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,250
complicated text we want to get on there

00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,370
fast so we need to be testing the level

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:10,130
so readable calm is a great way to do it

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:12,590
if you haven't used it before

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,300
your piece of paper you copy all the

00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,610
text you throw it in you hit a button

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,560
and boom you get a grade level so for

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,000
whatever stuff I was testing this day I

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,850
got a grade level 9

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,010
so if v grades are bar 9 might be too

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,270
high depending on who my audience is

00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,520
right we've got to figure out who our

00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,950
audience is how high it should be if you

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,110
have trouble like if you're you know at

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,210
a higher educated you know higher ed

00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,800
place a lot of times I hear well we

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,800
can't you know can't drop or grade

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,720
really should be a that PhD or college

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,370
level you don't want to be people don't

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,380
want to read that kind of thick stuff

00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:47,270
unless it's like a specific case study

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,630
or something that's in that kind of

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,940
Content area next one is findability can

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,460
you actually find it on the page and

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,170
there's two kind of tests that work for

00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,900
this you can also do in-person testing

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,730
but two other options one is tree

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,100
testing and the other is first-click

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,750
testing so tree testing is really a

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,480
navigation test where you put this

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,220
navigation tree in and then you ask like

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,500
ten questions and say where would I find

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,510
this and so we're making sure that they

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,940
can find the content item that they're

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,620
looking for first-click testing is

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,150
taking a look at the page asking a

00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,950
question and say where would I find that

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,540
and then they click at their first spot

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,910
where they think they'd find the content

00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,620
it will very clearly show where if

00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,510
you're on track so also both online

00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:33,590
tests so that you can just grab people

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:36,500
and do it in a much quicker time finally

00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:39,260
comprehension is really 10 a user read

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,090
the content find the content and then

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,070
can they do something about it can they

00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,250
act on it can they donate money can they

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,080
engage with us can they reach out

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,640
comprehension is huge and that's really

00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,430
where I would recommend doing the

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,790
in-person testing and I know who drink

00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,700
Starbucks here that's less than I saw on

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,290
we have the app right the little app and

00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,820
you push a button and coffee shows up up

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,260
your table that's what you're going to

00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,840
do you're going to go to Starbucks or

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,460
whatever coffee is out here and you're

00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,480
going to sit down and you're going to

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,220
hit the app and you're going to have

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,990
your first user testing person you run

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,160
through your questions and done you'll

00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,740
be done like that and all you have to do

00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,480
is buy a five-dollar coffee you can do

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,550
that you can go to an event and the

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,620
client maybe has a big event and you

00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,730
just grab some people it's super easy

00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,170
but we want to make sure people are

00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:31,800
understand and be able to make some good

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:35,760
decisions number eight they reached the

00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:41,760
finish line but that is it how many

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:44,940
people are doing governance it's hard

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,490
so my new theory is maybe we should just

00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,070
wait we get to the end we're exhausted

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,570
maybe you know someone's boss won't let

00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,680
them keep working on it maybe they just

00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,960
need a mental break

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,670
so my new idea is that we need to wait

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,609
for those that might not know what

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,680
governesses is really it's just the plan

00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,290
of maintaining for the content creation

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,510
to publishing what is the process who is

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,880
doing it and how do you maintain that

00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,800
content in between so now that you're

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
done making the content for the new

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,510
website now you've got to figure out how

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,220
to maintain it and make new stuff so I'm

00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,710
thinking let's just wait three months

00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,600
and then as project manager schedule a

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,800
meeting with them and do this we're

00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,810
going to go there and we're going to ask

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,340
them how is the website working for you

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,900
it's been three months the honeymoon

00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,550
periods over what could we have done

00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,200
differently so it's a great way to

00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,930
re-engage with them and do a little

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,750
retrospective salesperson maybe wants to

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,060
also come along and good vibes there or

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,890
count manager and then we're also going

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,830
to say okay now is the time to check in

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,780
with what you're doing and so my MVP for

00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,820
that process are these things and yours

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,530
might be a little different but I just

00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,240
want to be like okay so who is making

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,710
content now I know you guys all were

00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,690
doing it but there's probably less

00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,400
people right now right so who is it

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,650
going to be and then how are you getting

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,210
it from idea to that well I don't know

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,980
we haven't thought about that we didn't

00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,020
do that yet okay well let's talk about

00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,940
it so we want to figure out a new

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,250
workflow to get content publish with the

00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,480
least amount of barriers possible we

00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,700
also want to make sure they're doing an

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,170
editorial calendar right like I'm not a

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,790
writer I don't make these things but I

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,200
know that there's multiple channels they

00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,490
should be publishing on there's

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,720
different contents they need to make

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,510
they should be doing something every

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,920
week let's sit down and make that get

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,690
through a couple ideas and then they can

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,310
finish this out their own that way at

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,560
least they're constantly making some

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,690
stuff we also don't want to forget about

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,640
all that new stuff we wrote like it's

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,210
done I will never think about it but

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,940
they need to look at it

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:40,000
I think the very low level is look at it

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,650
once a year a solo level the other one

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,410
would be to kind of break it down by the

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,790
template and then decide how often you

00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,620
should review it because some stuff can

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,270
kind of sit there and then some some

00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,910
stuff should be iterated on more often

00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,920
and then make sure someone's looking at

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,840
analytics and kind of changing content

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,190
based on that just make sure it honestly

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,870
like someone will raise your hand and

00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,770
tell us what you're doing otherwise you

00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:04,480
got to make sure someone's doing that I

00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:07,000
actually had an interesting story we

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,060
worked with a member organization that

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,820
we went to massive massive content items

00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,200
and they actually hired brain traffic if

00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,640
you ever heard of them they're out of

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,020
Minneapolis really great content

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,400
strategy firms they heard him do a

00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,750
workshop and they did this whole

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,820
workshop and then everyone on their

00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,710
staff read the book the content strategy

00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,390
book and they're all in it and they did

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,690
it through the whole project which was

00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,700
awesome and then you know they stopped

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,800
and then I talked to them a couple years

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,450
back and said okay well where you're

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
you're doing a new website now how is

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,630
your content going and they said well

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:43,420
we've added 3,000 pages and I said what

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,140
3,000 pages in two years they stopped

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,970
those people had done everything right

00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,160
quit when it came to maintaining it and

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,110
doing governance so I think we got to

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,780
cut ourselves some slack and then just

00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,210
focus on the minimal stuff but without

00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,220
us as project managers telling people

00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,460
and explaining that to them I think it

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,560
just doesn't get thrown to the side the

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,260
ninth and final challenge is their

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:13,300
co-workers want to help not really and

00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:17,080
have interesting bad ideas yes

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:19,000
politics so we need to help them manage

00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,010
politics I tend to find this in either

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,720
large organizations or very siloed

00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,700
department organizations where

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,350
everyone's fighting for their turf I

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,400
actually spent with someone a couple

00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,780
weeks ago where they're going to

00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,890
definitely have that challenge they're

00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,570
going to have to figure it out it's like

00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,890
what about this oh you need to ask that

00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,270
department whatever you have an opinion

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,480
about it note they need to talk about it

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:39,460
so it's challenging and I think the big

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,750
thing is what how can we mitigate it

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,610
because it's not going to go away right

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,430
so the first thing is really

00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:47,180
communication I had a client once decide

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,000
when it had all these tough

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,650
wobbles internally he picks out two or

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,060
three key people that were really the

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,190
problem people that were going to go to

00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,740
the full staff or go to the meetings

00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,270
just be a pain in the butt right so he

00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,370
picked them out and met with them

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,470
individually for like an hour before the

00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,970
project started he met with him again in

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,380
the middle of the project and then he

00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,180
met with them at the end and let me just

00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,280
tell you if he really mitigated that

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,680
problem so I think that is a really good

00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,570
option another thing is is I tell folks

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,920
that when there is like a ring right so

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,330
there's not just a web group and then

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,620
there's a staff but there's a web and

00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,780
then there's the kind of stakeholders

00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,580
but not stakeholders group meet with

00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,220
them every three weeks there's always

00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,380
something to share there's always some

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,960
document or some decisions made show

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,570
that to them ask for their opinions and

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,630
move on and it turns out those folks

00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,340
tend to ever disrupt the boat they just

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,590
want to be heard they just want to know

00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,300
what's going on and giving a very set

00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,950
structure and I like having clients to

00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,660
have a scheduled every three weeks those

00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,740
otherwise are like oh what's probably

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,540
not important we probably don't need to

00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,070
share it know every three weeks is going

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,620
to happen get it set right off the bat

00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,690
and then you're set the final thing is

00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,040
doing internal stakeholders so just

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,470
grabbing some of those key people that

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,450
are in that middle ring and just as an

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,710
agency meet with them and ask them

00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,060
questions you know what do you like

00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,130
about the website what don't you like

00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,810
about the website what do you see going

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,970
forward how is the organization

00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,920
structured different things like that

00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,620
that would really just flush out some of

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,620
their ideas give them a place in a space

00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,420
to give their thoughts the other thing

00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,130
is data you know what if you're going to

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,950
all complain about your stuff like here

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,550
here's the truth here's the facts and I

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:27,800
really go back to the tree testing again

00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:29,180
really if you have a problem of where

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,770
people are going to find your content or

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,870
I just moved it in the footer we're

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,220
going to test that no big deal I'm going

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,630
to make ten questions I'm going to put

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,460
the navigation in there and I'm going to

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,900
send it to 50 people outside your

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,910
organization I'm gonna send it to

00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,140
everybody inside your organization and

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,210
we're just going to see what happens

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,770
well we'll learn a couple things but

00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,250
we're going to probably find out that

00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,960
people can find your stuff just fine and

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,260
the test is great because it gives you

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,970
if they actually have a successful

00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,620
response and how long it takes so if it

00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,960
takes someone a really long time to get

00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,819
there

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,440
well then it's probably also a problem

00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,750
so it not only helps you as a

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,390
development team it also eases that kind

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,809
of tension I think this is a really big

00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:13,020
huge one that helps also provide a

00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:15,240
backup I find that in educational

00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,190
situations maybe school districts or if

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,230
someone is less savvy and technology on

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,750
the team they start to panic about the

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,400
change they panic about not getting to

00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,920
see stuff and they're really good with

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,170
having things exactly as it as they used

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,970
to be and so if we can take their old

00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,880
site we can put it on our server and say

00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,140
hey you can go look up prom 2016 over

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,300
there when you got to put that on your

00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,400
site then they're fine it kind of

00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,109
relaxes them most people don't ever go

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,960
back to that but if you can just put it

00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:44,910
over there Oh kind of calm them down the

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,260
final thing is feel free to be the bad

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,950
guy

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,690
how many people are internal PM here how

00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:54,210
many times have you told your co-workers

00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,859
or supervisors how something should be

00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,260
in your great idea in your process and

00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,940
they don't listen to you and then how

00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,319
many times is someone like me walk in

00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,970
and say the exact same thing and they

00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:08,190
listen to them right annoying so people

00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,859
like me need to use that power to help

00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,450
out that client p.m. we can work with

00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,970
them and then help them get their

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,589
message across and be the bad guy there

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,000
is nothing this is not about what is the

00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:20,910
client needs this is about being a

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,130
really good partner and sharing you know

00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,510
giving them the best product right so

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,829
for a good partner we're going to tell

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,470
them how it is and we're going to try to

00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:30,630
make the best route possible and so

00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,880
helping those internal PMS is what we

00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,930
need to do and support them so be the

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,760
bad guy so that's the 9 topic before we

00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,079
go into questions we do have some extra

00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,540
credit cause your project managers I

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,099
know you want it but have you ever gone

00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,510
to the project manager summit the

00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,549
digital project manager something like

00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,970
it starts at 8:00 a.m. and the entire

00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:52,559
place is full like project managers are

00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:55,589
so extra credit these are my two

00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,359
favorite books they're really easy reads

00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:59,430
but if you don't want to read them you

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,380
can really easily read chapters or

00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,510
sections or like oh I wonder about that

00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,859
tool what's what's that about and then

00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,440
you can read that section and kind of

00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:09,290
add it to your MVP process so those are

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,300
my two favorites

00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:14,090
and then I wanted to leave everyone with

00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,830
one more final quote it's really about

00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:19,790
the demand for content project managers

00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:21,710
has risen 500% over the last year which

00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,800
is massive and I'm totally making that

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:31,720
up but we can do that we can do that in

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:34,730
2018 right so so close I gotcha

00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,320
but either way challenge yourself how do

00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,170
you want to evolve your role whether

00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,360
you're an internal PM or external what

00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:43,010
do you want to be we can do anything and

00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,110
I'm pretty proud of the PM community

00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:58,910
both digital and Drupal so let's make a

00:46:45,110 --> 00:47:00,620
big difference and regard questions yes

00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,600
the slides are actually available on my

00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,890
SlideShare and I'll provide a link right

00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,890
at the end so they're already up there

00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,890
yeah

00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,409
[Music]

00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:40,760
mm-hmm yeah I think honestly I just have

00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,440
a come-to-jesus conversation it's nice

00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,870
the first thing is when you're making

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,030
that schedule with them if you know them

00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,460
tell yourself like is this actually

00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,170
realistic for them or anybody are they

00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,990
actually going to do it and if you think

00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,790
it's on the edge maybe pull back and put

00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,170
a couple things over on the side and say

00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,910
let's start with this first and see how

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,430
it goes and evaluate in a month or two

00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:04,100
and then add some stuff in and then if

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,660
they're just not doing it hope everyone

00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,340
together and say you know what I want

00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,190
you guys to be successful you need this

00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,990
to meet your marketing goals what's

00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,970
what's the hindrance and it's okay no

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,140
one's to blame here but tell me why you

00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,430
think this isn't working

00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,840
how can we change it because it's

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,180
sometimes maybe it's a tool maybe

00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,800
someone's not the right person you need

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,880
to move people in or out and then also

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,520
say you know have you thought about

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,800
hiring someone do you need someone from

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,350
the outside the contractor part-time to

00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,600
kind of fill that in but I think the

00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:34,280
worst is like letting it go too long but

00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,530
also you know you know if they can do it

00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,690
right it's like you're like all right

00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:41,020
we'll just cut back and then start out

00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,020
from there

00:48:48,070 --> 00:49:02,720
so don't do it at all have you been with

00:48:53,030 --> 00:49:04,910
a client for a long time yes Maddy yeah

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,940
I mean part of it is you have no control

00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:09,500
right you can't sit there there is like

00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,960
a level of how much they ignoring you

00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,220
how they don't and also supervisor so

00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,260
there's things like if they just

00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,140
disappear can you pop it in their office

00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,670
say hi I want to bring cookies what's

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,830
going on they can feel guilty

00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,510
there's also maybe some pressure you can

00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,160
put from the side or from the top so

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,080
like if their supervisor sometimes I'll

00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,790
just copy a boss on something like hey

00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,040
guys haven't seen a lot going on what's

00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,900
going on like we use Basecamp and so

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,280
those kind of things we would put in

00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,660
Basecamp but when we're just working

00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,460
with the project management or not doing

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,370
stuff I'll put that in Basecamp all day

00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:41,510
long hey everybody nothing's happening

00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:43,640
something tends to happen or you could

00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,660
call someone on that or at the next

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,270
meeting that you guys have time for

00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,800
whatever in the project bring it up like

00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,540
here's where we're at guys based on this

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,640
or timelines moving back is that okay

00:49:50,540 --> 00:50:01,340
with you what do you want to do about it

00:49:52,640 --> 00:50:03,580
so I think pressure I can feel bad no we

00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,580
don't

00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,970
for sports

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:21,440
mm-hmm yeah that's should have mentioned

00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:23,180
that in the beginning but essentially a

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,339
lot of this is if you don't have a

00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:27,109
content strategy strategist on board

00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:29,510
because we don't and I don't think a lot

00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:30,980
of people do but I'm hoping like in two

00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,230
three years we'll all have them on our

00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,940
staff but I think in your situation when

00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,349
you have one I think what's their scale

00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,150
like some people are good at details

00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,069
people aren't so they're a little more

00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,900
creative in airy-fairy and that's where

00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:43,640
filling in those pieces and kind of

00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:47,359
working with them but I'd imagine it

00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:49,369
changes based on whoever it is but a lot

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,990
of times a lot of these things we talked

00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:52,760
about are really project management

00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,829
stuff all the detail tracking the

00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,319
timelines debugging all that kind of

00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:59,539
stuff is so I would just unless you know

00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:01,309
I'd actually step over the line until

00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:03,020
they push you back if you're not sure

00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:05,690
because otherwise things are probably

00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,299
falling I'm sorry falling in the hole

00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,589
sar just just start filling the gaps and

00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:11,599
say hey let me know if I'm taking

00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:13,780
something you want to do and go from

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,780
there

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,680
hmm well the goal would never be working

00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:46,329
with someone you don't get along with so

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,329
we can blame sales I do that

00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,820
yeah I mean I think maybe trying to take

00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,530
the relationship outside of the project

00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,390
so every time you're meeting all you're

00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:04,160
doing is talking about the project so

00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,720
maybe driving a lunch and just talking

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,030
about ideas and saying how we can work

00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,710
together I also like during a project to

00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,330
take a break in the middle depending on

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,770
if it's really big a couple breaks and

00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,810
say we're not talking about the project

00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,260
today all I want to do is say how's it

00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,150
going

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,740
how is it going what's working for you

00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,790
what's not working for you but I'd

00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,520
probably just try to take that

00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,750
relationship into a different space so

00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,730
it's not always like who's in charge

00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,020
kind of in the meetings but just feel

00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,510
like hey let's grab lunch let's talk

00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,670
about it who are you what do you like

00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,020
what's your home life like you know if

00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,430
you can make it a more of a personal

00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:38,500
relationship that we'll probably use

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,500
that a lot more help

00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,050
[Music]

00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,359
when the client says they're not that

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:58,549
they're saying to you you're not the

00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:58,549
content expert yeah

00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,539
[Music]

00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:08,910
yeah and you said that's great I'm not

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,620
the content expert either I don't write

00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:12,930
I'm the project manager and I'm going to

00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,340
help you get through the process so if

00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,620
there's no one on that side I think

00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,630
there's often not someone there so that

00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,920
uses attention if you say it we're going

00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,270
to do contests right am to lead you

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,440
through that but if there's someone

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,790
there you're not trying to fill their

00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,640
role anyway you're just trying to fill

00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,650
around their role and so I just focus on

00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,180
I'm the project manager and let me help

00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,470
you what are you going to do and then

00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,020
what how do you want your role to be in

00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,310
this process and just try not to

00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,320
complete it even though you might be

00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:57,420
doing some stuff under that rule let's

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:59,130
just don't tell them and go oh I could

00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,500
tell you a story about that there's a

00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,420
confab for higher ed by the way there's

00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,360
a content strategy conference for higher

00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,710
ed that conference in general is awesome

00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,090
they have the general one in Minneapolis

00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,580
on Ventura so it's really good that they

00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,230
do have one for higher ed I actually

00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,330
know someone at the University of

00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,220
Minnesota and she worked on this website

00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,960
where that had the exact same problem so

00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,080
what she decided to do is put in them

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,200
all pictures and text about grave Giver

00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,810
gravedigger

00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,640
you know the monster truck thing the big

00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,960
monster trucks gravedigger and so they

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,280
said deadlines the deadlines had

00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,230
deadlines and you know what that sucker

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,170
launched with great digger all over it

00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:38,880
and that team got that content done

00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:40,740
within one week it was amazing but she

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,960
has the same problem because they're

00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,420
experts they don't trust you and so if

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,160
you can kind of figure out how you can

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,930
promote them as the subject-matter

00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,970
expert because that is important they

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,230
need to be putting that input and that

00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:56,400
you're kind of just there to guide them

00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,050
that's the best you can do but timeline

00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,610
wise to me when I work with government

00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,920
or education I stretched the timeline

00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:03,450
now I just go with the reality of it

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,030
because it's not going to move that fast

00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,170
and then I prioritize here's all what

00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,370
we're going to do tell me what the most

00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,760
important is because you're not going to

00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,260
get it

00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,940
well no no what no you're not going to

00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,140
do it and guess what we can launch and

00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,640
then we'll just add

00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,079
no one's it's not going to bother them

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,059
as long as we're not missing some key

00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,980
information about how to get there we'll

00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:21,119
just add it over time don't worry about

00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,460
it you're super busy you're doing

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:28,339
important stuff teaching people I think

00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,339
ego and then like just stretch and cut

00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:38,430
that gather content has dates in it

00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:40,200
there's a couple other ones but I like

00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,510
keeping everything and gather content so

00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,279
well like it doesn't set up as a date

00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,960
there's another one out there that I

00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,460
can't remember that's more for content

00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,289
creation ongoing that has a more

00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,789
traditional editorial calendar and I

00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:56,099
can't remember what it is but if you

00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:58,910
google you'll find it pretty fast I'm

00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,910
super helpful bit

00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,190
hmm

00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:17,040
as we do we put the whole thing in there

00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,300
yeah but we don't all the inventory so

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,980
he's asking you know do we put

00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,230
everything from the inventory and to

00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,240
gather content and we do put all of the

00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:26,250
navigation in there we don't copy and

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,380
paste over like the URLs and all the

00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,450
extra stuff we really get rid of that at

00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,680
that point but we do put it in there and

00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,350
then prioritize so I think it's

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,180
important to have the full list so they

00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:39,090
can kind of see their choices along the

00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,520
way and then what we do for things like

00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:44,370
blog will write like blog title one blog

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,500
title two or if there's something really

00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:48,540
big that it's going to be done for an

00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,120
import or it just seems really silly

00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,160
like we don't tend to often write like a

00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,960
lot of staff files like for the school

00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,670
they're gonna have 200 staff BIOS I'm

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,570
not going to put 200 staff files and

00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,040
then they're going to actually just

00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,720
start entering that into your full way

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,890
before we get it seemed and ready to go

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,900
we're just going to make that content

00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:06,060
site first because the quantity is so

00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,040
high so yeah so if you have a high

00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,870
quantity you if you're going to do

00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,810
gather content you make sure you can

00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:15,210
import it over otherwise don't make them

00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:17,670
do that because it's just not nice but

00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:23,150
yeah so we sometimes pull some stuff in

00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:23,150
there oh yeah anyone else a couple

00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,620
[Music]

00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:35,920
anybody know of a Drupal module that

00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,240
will do the readable calm concept

00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,480
basically gives you a score of what

00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,480
grade

00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,450
you

00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,210
