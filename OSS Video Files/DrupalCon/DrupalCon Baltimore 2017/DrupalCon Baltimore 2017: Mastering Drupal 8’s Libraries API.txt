Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Mastering Drupal 8’s Libraries API
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	If you’ve ever had to overwrite a module’s css file or a core javascript library in Drupal 7, you likely remember the experience. And not because it was a glorious encounter that left you teary-eyed at the sheer beauty of its ease and simplicity.

The FOAD technique and the other ways of including of excluding assets are gone. Along with Drupal 8 came the Libraries API and whole new way of managing libraries through a series of yaml files.

The Libraries API grants developers flexibility and control over their css and js assets including the ability to overwrite core libraries, add libraries directly to templates, specify dependencies and more. It’s a big improvement, but it can be a bit of a learning curve to get up to speed on the new system.

This session is for beginner to intermediate front-end developers with at least basic experience theming in Drupal 7 or Drupal 8. You’ll learn how to leverage the Libraries API in Drupal 8 for granular control over how and where css and js assets get added and support new front-end development trends including component-based theming and atomic design.
