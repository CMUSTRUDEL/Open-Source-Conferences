Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: One Site to Rule Them All
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	This project for Obermeyer, the Aspen-based ski company, began with a broad set of challenges, including three seperate websites, three distinct audiences, and independent ERP and B2B ordering systems. The goal was to optimize Obermeyer’s digital processes and consolidate their connections with customers through a single, well-integrated platform.

To meet the needs of each audience — or user group — we prioritized user experience. Throughout the process, we had to consider the following:

B2C users complete final purchases on one of Obermeyer’s 3rd party dealer websites
B2B users buy product through Obermeyer’s website with purchase orders (no cash transactions)
VIP users are provided discounts on items that can be purchased directly from Obermeyer in exchange for completing a brief online training
Merging three separate websites from Drupal 6 into a single site on Drupal 8 was a complex process that included careful design and testing. After launching, we monitored the site carefully, using A/B tests and anonymous using recording to determine whether customers experiencing the site as intended. 

The audience will learn how an iterative design process and consistent testing helped succesfully launch the first Drupal 8 enterprise ecommerce website.

so thank you for joining me I'm going to

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,089
talk to you about a project we've been

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,849
working on for a company called

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,590
Overmeyer where we focus on building a

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,020
website that facilitated sales for both

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,910
their consumer and business customers my

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,770
name is mark Dodson I live in a little

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,160
town called Ancaster which is in Ontario

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,859
Canada so 45 minutes south of Toronto

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,170
and I work as a user experience

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,669
strategist and designer at a company

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,489
called blue spark and so blue spark is a

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:36,780
distributed design and digital shop so

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,480
we focused on building large-scale

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,489
digital projects primarily with open

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,870
source open source technology so a lot

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,539
of Drupal projects that were working on

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,850
has offered us the ability to work on

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,539
some interesting projects in the higher

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,449
ed library and e-commerce spaces and as

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,980
you can see by our map we have employees

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,430
in nine countries and five different

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,989
time zones we've also been really

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,719
fortunate to work with a number of

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,500
really great organizations like Red Hat

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,810
TripAdvisor Stanford University UCLA

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,479
name a few and and of course we're

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,240
working with Overmyer we're going to

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,310
talk to you about today so a little

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,080
background Overmeyer is an Aston based

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,150
winterwear company that was started back

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,159
in 1947 by a guy named Klaus Obermeyer

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,890
who actually still runs the company to

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,689
this day and as a company that got

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,420
started long before the internet they

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,220
actually built relationships with their

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,439
dealers which has ultimately led to the

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,329
success but because of those

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
relationships it's actually led to some

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,990
interesting conversion workflows online

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,860
so my goals for today is to offer an

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,409
overview of the Overmeyer project

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,030
highlight some of the challenges we face

00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,619
doing this project and offer some

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,180
insight into the tools that we've been

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,640
doing using to make design and

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,890
development decisions so I'm going to

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,799
give you the cold note version of the

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,320
Overmeyer history they started in the

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,569
early 2000s by building out a content

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,080
management system but as they needed

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,210
ecommerce

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,730
they built out in commerce platform then

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,250
they needed inventory management then he

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,930
built on a CRM and then it was email

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,430
newsletters and social media and you get

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,540
the picture they started building on so

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,920
much stuff that they ended up with so

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,230
much technical debt that it made it

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,880
difficult for them to to move forward

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,770
and having recently you know investing

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,020
in a comprehensive ERP system to manage

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,390
their inventory and supply chain Matt

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,510
processes actually they ended up with

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,650
three user facing sites that were where

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:47,020
Umbro in a broken state so a really high

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,020
level when we took over the project they

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,330
had a b2c site that was running Drupal 6

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,330
they had a VIP site which is like a

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,860
loyalty program site which was also

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,010
running Drupal 6 and then they had a

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,570
business b2b sites that was being

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,600
facilitated through a third party system

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,300
so after a thorough discovery phase with

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,340
the Overmyer team we decided to

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,160
consolidate all three sites onto the

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,310
drupal platform and facilitate sales

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,700
using Drupal commerce and this gave us

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,350
the benefit of maintaining a single site

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,540
and also being able to reuse design

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,540
components across the three for a more

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,880
consistent user experience we also

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,290
suggested at the time again going from

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,750
Drupal 6 to doing the upgrade from

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,730
Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 which at the time

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,290
was very early I think was only out for

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,930
a couple weeks so there was a number of

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,910
challenges kind of along the way related

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,440
to that but that was done in an effort

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,120
to you know offer them the most

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,900
up-to-date systems kind of future proof

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,910
their investments so it's important to

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,360
understand that they have three very

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,739
distinct purchasing groups and each of

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
these and its kind of presented some

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,310
challenges while integrating Drupal

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,260
commerce and where the user experience

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,780
needed to be designing a way to

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,410
facilitate sales regardless of the use

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,510
case so they had a b2c on sites with a

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,430
consumer facing site which was still at

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,019
eight sales actually through third-party

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,280
third-party retailers so you're not

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,530
actually checking out on

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,959
on their site so this is all gets into

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,100
more detail about that then their VIP

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,450
site is on the to facilitate on sales

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,130
through a traditional kind of e-commerce

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,780
fashion where you can check the product

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,060
directly from their their website and

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,940
then they have business customers that

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,670
facilitate purchases through through the

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,200
exact same site and the same catalog but

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,840
are billed with the PIO so there's no

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,990
cash transaction so I just walk you

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,330
through these a little bit more detail

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,960
so for the b2c the for b2c purchasing

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,610
they actually have a workflow that we

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,350
had actually never seen before they

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,020
don't allow their business model doesn't

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,790
allow for a direct-to-consumer sales so

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,430
when you went on to their site before

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,390
before we took over the project you

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,210
would find a product that you were

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,850
interested in you would select a color

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,710
for that product you would select a size

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,280
for the product and then what you would

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,440
get is a list of dealers in the form of

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,440
logos that we're supposed to have that

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,780
product in stock and so then from there

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,729
you would select the dealer and you

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,210
would be directed to that dealers

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:27,040
website to check out the final product

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,560
so essentially this shopping cart

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,930
experience is a single product ordering

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,970
system which is not really great for

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,550
company that sells matching outfit

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,290
if you wanted to go and buy matching

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,970
pant or hat or gloves you have to

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,490
actually go back to the Overmeyer site

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,400
and go through the entire process again

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,979
so we slightly modified it in the sense

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,130
that we built in a my cart page where

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,320
they can add product to a cart like you

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,820
would expect and then based on that you

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,669
would take them from there my cart page

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,470
and then select the dealers that they

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,510
want to check that up with the ideas

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,979
we're taking those single item sales up

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,860
to multiple items sale orders another

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,500
area that required improvement was the

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,330
handing off to the retailer's website so

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,120
by taking a look at the data from their

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,180
partners the retail partners we started

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,160
to see lots of patterns of cart

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,479
abandonment so they get over there and

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,010
they leave their site so one of the

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
awkward workflows before consumers is

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,520
that you would select a retailer for

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,690
checkout and

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,250
wouldn't actually realize that they were

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,099
being directed to that retailers wife

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,990
that retailers website so from a user

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,500
experience perspective it needed to be

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,240
clear you know what was happening so we

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,370
actually ended up building a completely

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,770
fictitious transfer window that displays

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,180
for a few seconds and this just gives

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,849
the user a little bit more detail about

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,470
what's actually happening so that when

00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:55,300
they landed on the dealer site it wasn't

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:57,900
quite such a jarring experience the VIP

00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,080
section it essentially translates to

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,550
friends and family pricing or but more

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,319
importantly is really for the sales

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,520
associate so sales associates that are

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,370
pushing their products on the sales

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,020
floor they wanted to give them discounts

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,900
so they actually have cards that they

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,240
hand out with a VIP URL and a discount

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,009
and that user can then log into the site

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,630
like create an account they have to

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,729
watch an introductory video so getting a

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,740
little bit of education in there and

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,960
then they're able to access the same

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,569
catalog as the b2b customers but with

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,969
that discounting pricing and although

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,710
the VIP section required some

00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,849
interesting ways to still take discount

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,680
it's actually been the most

00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:40,080
straightforward to implement because

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
it's it's direct sales from the website

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,650
b2b purchasing so facilitating sales

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,240
through for both consumers and sales

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,569
associates is relatively easy because

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,029
they have similar buying patterns the

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,460
only difference really is that you know

00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:59,199
from an actual purchasing standpoint is

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,979
that the sales associates are getting a

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,050
discounted price once they're logged in

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,699
trying to facilitate

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,279
beetus b2b sales on the same site it

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,840
becomes significantly more you know

00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,370
complex because they had they buy in

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,710
bulk and they have more complex needs in

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,409
terms of how they purchase product so

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,440
based on the business customers use a

00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,240
rule we actually adds up at remove to

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,930
add to bag button that was on the top

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,729
left by the title and we give them a

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,860
form that gives them a lot more control

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,940
over adding multiple variations of

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,160
product to

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,220
two of their their cart they can add

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,020
multiple sizes different colors and then

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,210
we have some persuasive patterns in

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,800
there as well where we're showing stock

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,080
leathers levels that are getting low in

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,460
an effort to hopefully get other deals

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,450
to buy them as they see that they're

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,710
running out of stock so one of the

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,410
interesting things we learned through

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,150
discovery was the way dealers actually

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,280
purchase product for their retail

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,550
locations we actually hadn't considered

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,650
that they they might have multiple local

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,160
retail locations they might have sticks

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:09,310
or plastic plus location so it turns out

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,990
that the dealer that the dealers

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,880
purchase product for each of the retail

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,210
location individually and actually have

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,240
budgets set for each location so on the

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,370
old site that what dealers were doing

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,410
was they would open up multiple tabs and

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,880
add product to cart for those multiple

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,340
tabs and try to order for each of those

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,750
locations but that broke a lot of times

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,480
when people would lose their orders and

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,150
things like that so what we've done is

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,800
we've actually built on we built a thing

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,720
to work in progress orders where we

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,850
store multiple shopping carts at the

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,600
same time so any retailer that has

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,800
multiple locations can create cards and

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,720
and store them and save them and they

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,630
can go back to them multiple times we've

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,310
even built in duplicating those carts

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,890
too so they've reorder things over and

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,750
over again so this is something a really

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,610
excited vote and where Drupal commerce

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,990
is flexibility has really kind of helped

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,910
us out one of my favorite features is is

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,010
the ability for merchandisers to

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,530
actually create merchandising boards or

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,850
lookbook so we heard from our client and

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,040
a number of their dealers that

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,360
merchandisers would add product to the

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,120
shopping cart just to see what the

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,650
product would looked like together so we

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,510
created merchandising boards as a way to

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,430
offer these merchandiser merchandises

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,680
the ability to assemble product on a

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,840
board that might look good together on

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,030
the sales floor so they can name their

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,260
board they can add in a description they

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,930
can add product they can move the

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,730
product around on the board and in

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,650
addition to the customization features

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,820
they're merchandisers will be able to

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,740
share these boards with key decision

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,040
makers within the organization and then

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,829
turn

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,000
those boards into orders so we're hoping

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,060
that adding this functionality will

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,589
increase the overall product sales by

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,360
simplifying a process that was a little

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:56,769
bit kludgy so there's always going to be

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,540
challenges on a project of this size but

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,850
it's important to plan and risk managed

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,860
through them aside from the technical

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,500
challenges we knew that facilitating all

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,209
three you purchasing user roles would be

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,740
difficult we've definitely had some

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,139
major challenges I'm trying to clarify

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,959
the bee disease experience and

00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:16,029
simplifying the business experience and

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,399
that's just we want a much more

00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,660
streamlined user experience there

00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,699
unfortunately had a number of usability

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,519
methods to help us through many of the

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,589
challenges we've based on this project

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,089
so want to start by defining what a

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:29,589
conversion is because it's actually

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,360
different for the site I'm gonna focus

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,529
on consumers we've just launched the b2b

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,259
step so we don't really have a lot of

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,240
the data there but so I'm gonna focus on

00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:40,420
consumer stuff so a conversion in in

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,430
this case is a transactional value that

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,199
we pass on to the retailer site so if

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,029
you buy a jacket for $200 and end up on

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:48,970
the retailer site to purchase it that

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:52,209
transactional value becomes our our

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,490
conversion and sadly due to the complex

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,170
nature of the old site in terms of how

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,050
conversions were being tracked we didn't

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,430
have all of the ideal baseline data that

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,620
we needed to make good decisions moving

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,510
forward this is where things became

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,430
pretty interesting for us we worked

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,639
really hard to develop a site that was

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,069
easy for customers to purchase from

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,130
taking into consideration at unusual

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:16,930
checkout process again the old the old

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,910
site only allowed for single item sales

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,889
so we introduced that that the ability

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,360
to do multiple item sales to answer that

00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:27,970
so unfortunate when we launched the

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,569
conversions were pretty horrific so we

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:35,110
will haunt in and last year in week 39

00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:36,939
and we were down about $250,000 from the

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,529
same time period in the previous year

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:41,560
which was only in a period of a couple

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,180
of weeks and that number was being

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,850
pulled from

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,260
retailers locations and analytics it was

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,640
being pulled in from a lot of location

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,840
so we didn't actually didn't know that

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,450
of the overall number so traffic was

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,890
down about 30% to the to the site but

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,340
that even wouldn't have accounted for

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,140
the decrease in conversions so after the

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,030
panic subsided we tried to understand

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,520
you know what was causing this dramatic

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,200
decrease in conversions we were thinking

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,670
it was a sticker shock because now they

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,140
you know their customers were used to

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,730
buying a single order product and now

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,140
they're seeing multiple and the total

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,520
and then be sent off to the retailer

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,830
site was it that that moment because

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,270
that jarring experience between you know

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,030
going from no virmire site to the

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,610
retailer say we weren't really sure and

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,950
so I was all project projects you want

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,600
to have really good baseline data to

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,190
have understanding you know where the

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
project was before you launched a new

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,150
site or a new feature and again we

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,820
didn't have that so we started

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,640
reevaluating how we could get the site

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,230
to a point before our launch so whit

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,390
before we took over in an effort to kind

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:50,230
of move the site forward use using a

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:53,200
number of usability tests so after a

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,240
number of discussion we we decided to

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,430
implement the old e-commerce model on

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,810
the new platform so we so we were

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,090
ensuring some you know building some

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,600
historical data that we were told was

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,190
working well so this was a reactionary

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,540
measure the reactionary move and

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,000
definitely not what we would normally

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,310
recommend however we were under a lot of

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
pressure to fix this problem so we hid

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,490
the ability to add the bag right so

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,870
doing the multiple item sales and we

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,760
introduced their old model which is if

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,260
you select the size and the color you

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,190
get the logos that we've gone back down

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:30,990
to single item sales so not ideal like

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,130
here's what happen we had near-identical

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,760
near-identical traffic from one week to

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,970
the next but we saw an 8% increase in

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,250
train conversion and so this was huge

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,170
for us we were like baffled us how to

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,960
how reducing functionality could

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,700
actually increase conversion we even

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,610
went and start looking at the average

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,339
order and the average order went from

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,749
$306 dance 100

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,269
seventy dollars which would be expected

00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:57,470
because we were going from single

00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,139
multiple item sales back down to single

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,170
item sales and it turns out that we

00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,490
overlooked one key feature that we

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,439
hadn't even considered before this

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,660
project and that was that we saw an

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:11,059
average job in 10 to 15 degrees we

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,399
temperature in key markets for their

00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,079
products because they fill winter where

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,620
it just happened

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,999
bad luck that we launched the feature

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,809
reducing functionality on a week when it

00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:25,610
got pulled so this was our aha moment we

00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,259
started thinking about factors that

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,819
could play into the sales process and

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,949
how we could start to monitor these

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:34,100
factors to make sure that we don't have

00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:35,509
them happen again at the future so we've

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,160
actually now built out a tool that plugs

00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,439
into our analytics to show weather

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,180
patterns and transactional values on a

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,300
session level so we actually tagged

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,769
every user that visits the site with the

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,930
weather from their location so we get

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:51,620
the high and low temperature whether

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,670
it's sunny rainy if it's snowing and it

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,769
gives us a little bit more insight into

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,059
what's going on so this is hopefully

00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,649
going to help us make better decisions

00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,449
in the future or at least help us to

00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:03,470
understand what's going on when there is

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:06,679
a downturn so the lesson learned for us

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,569
is don't don't forget to keep an eye on

00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,660
the external factors so for the

00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:13,610
Overmeyer project weather was a big one

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,370
as it flows in the economy other ones

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,499
that affected us the launch was less

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,759
users to the Indus is left users to the

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:22,790
site because of an actual industry

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,279
downturn so many of their customers and

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,110
dealers experienced a 10 to 15 percent

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,759
decrease in sales across the board in

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,759
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,679
less users on less visitors because of

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,120
slowed marketing efforts so obermeyer

00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,529
had actually slowed all their marketing

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,199
efforts because we were launching the

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,329
new site they wanted a wait to load up

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:42,589
and then also we launched preseason so a

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:44,600
lot of products wasn't actually

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,329
available yet online which also killed

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,639
conversions the best

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,800
so although the shock of you know the

00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,040
initial shock was pretty hard to take in

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,410
the evenings of losing $250,000 and that

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,230
sort of a short of time was pretty scary

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,490
we've actually made worked very hard to

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,220
make Garrity's

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,050
on the site so things like improving the

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,510
the design of the programming side of

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,660
things optimize the current site try to

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,760
get it to run faster we've improved the

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,490
up above the whole content and calls to

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,809
action where possible and what we're

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,640
finding is that many of the proven

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,650
improvements that we've been making when

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,199
those external factors were playing a

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,059
role now that things have picked up and

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,459
marketing is better and traffic is

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,700
better that we're now starting to reap

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,809
the benefits of that so in week 39 we

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,480
actually ended up getting being a 1.5 2%

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:41,450
conversion rate so 5.3 one percent in

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,620
week 48 and then we close out 2016 with

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,690
a 7.3 four percent conversion rate it's

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,670
gone up and down a bit but it's been

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,640
pretty steady in terms of how it's been

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,870
increasing so how do we make our design

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,340
and development decisions

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,750
well we do a lot of a/b testing and I'm

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,370
sure most of you know what this is but

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,080
for those of you don't it's a way of

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,179
comparing two versions of a webpage or

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,160
app and putting them against each other

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,780
to see which one converts better so in

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,740
this example here we actually we're

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,960
testing whether showing the sizes as

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,309
buttons compared to sizes of the

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
drop-down would convert better and

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:22,790
actually did so the version on the site

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,440
now is the sizing of buttons we're

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,690
running a B test using Google Analytics

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,130
sorry Google experiments and the benefit

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,380
of using Google experiments is that it

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,970
offers us the ability to a B test a

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,280
percentage of the traffic going to the

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,260
site so essentially we're not losing

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,660
tons of those conversions while we're

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,059
testing so for example we can test we

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,900
can a B test on 10% of the traffic then

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:46,250
Google splits it up 50/50 so we're about

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,679
7 months into the launch for the

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,600
consumer side of things and we continue

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,400
to test and iterate later this month

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,920
we're actually beginning a series of Av

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,290
tests to reintroduce that original cart

00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,360
feature that we reactively remove and a

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,890
number of other improvements to help

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,750
increase the overall conversion so

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,420
here's some tests now so this one this

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,550
is what's live right now so it's the old

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,590
the old failed model the next test is

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,560
going to remove the logos and put in a

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,160
button that says buy online now

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,370
we've seen a lot of confusion with users

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,200
not all so you're recording in a moment

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,180
of users like not understanding as the

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,910
logo is actually a button I'm so by

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,420
going to this route to buy online now

00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,860
we'll then launch a pop-up modal that

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,470
they can collect their dealer to check

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,150
out what this test is done the next one

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,130
is to take that buy online Now button

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,660
and change it to the add to bag so then

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,910
we're taking it back to multiple item

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,590
sales and then it would go through the

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,360
traditional cart feature and then from

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,830
the cart they would select their dealer

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,180
to checkout so it's an unusual checkout

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:50,140
process but we're trying to get back to

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:54,340
that multiple item sales multiple item

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,540
sales there so maybe testing is you know

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,950
the ensures that we're manage on

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,670
maintaining that sales while gaining an

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,370
understanding of what's actually

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,400
affecting it affecting the conversions

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,710
good or bad as I'm sure many of you are

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,990
using we use Google Analytics for a lot

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:13,030
of our insight so we've even tweaked it

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,680
a bit to make sure that we're you know

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,750
tracking the things actually matter to

00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,060
this particular project conversion rates

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,370
is a big one that we we manage of course

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,110
but transactional value by country is

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,000
pretty important for us

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,190
transactional values sent to the dealers

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,230
so we know if we've spent $10,000 or

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,420
$100,000 to a specific dealer it's

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,440
broken out by dealer transactional value

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,580
by device desktop mobile or tablet

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,960
transactional value by browser which

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,530
actually was pretty important for us

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,110
back in November 60% of their traffic is

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,880
on desktop Safari but it was the lowest

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,640
converting browser and it turned out

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,460
that it was a JavaScript bug so by

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,310
fixing that bug we were able to to make

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,360
that the highest converting browser now

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,590
we also keep an eye on session by

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,080
individuals for marketing optimization

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,080
and by gender for marketing optimization

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,460
the things that usability testing can be

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,230
expensive and but the harder part is

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,110
actually telling it to keep take holders

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,000
so you know user feedback is important

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,790
to get us out of our design and

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,440
development bubble and although setting

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,720
up a focus group and

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,549
user testings are often valuable the

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,100
cost to implement them is a little bit

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,750
scary to your stakeholders so it's

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,059
important to remember that our friends

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,950
and family are real users for the most

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,929
part it actually sounds pretty simple

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,940
but we actually we actually tried this

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:36,309
with our own team and it revealed areas

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,750
of concern when we ran scenarios with

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,549
them so we gave scenarios up to our

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,009
friends and family and it was

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,389
interesting that a number of the

00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,340
concerns that were raised were

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,289
consistent amongst all of our friends

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,789
and family so here's a couple of things

00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:52,179
that we that came out of just asking

00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:55,419
asking them for a little bit of help on

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:57,820
the far left one we have thumbnails with

00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,529
the large image above and the idea is

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,720
that you click the thumbnail and you get

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:03,909
the large version but on ours you have

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,259
2x hold down on the thumbnail a little

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,100
bit for it to launch which isn't I

00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:10,659
obviously ideal and obviously you see

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,610
what happens it wants to save it to the

00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,899
camera roll so that was a bug that we

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,149
were able to fix pretty quickly by

00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:19,029
asking for help the one on the far right

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,919
is a lightbox image that pops up we had

00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,960
the image scaling to the width of the

00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,990
image so if the image actually exceeded

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,580
height wise the device size you couldn't

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,250
close the image but the close button is

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,570
hidden so again just by asking our

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,629
friends and family for a little help is

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,860
uncovered some seemingly obvious things

00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:40,149
that we should have caught what we were

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,250
building it what users say they do and

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:44,850
what they actually do are often quite

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,080
different and as a result we've actually

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,940
introduced anonymous user recordings

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,429
that we can turn on and off as needed so

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,440
I thought it would share three different

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,330
recordings two failures and one success

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,629
one to kind of show what we see and how

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,179
we're using them so this is a recording

00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:03,789
and we can turn them on on and off as

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,549
needed and this is a user that's trying

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,990
to buy a product that you can't hear and

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:10,179
so they don't realize that you have to

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,370
select the size to get to get a button

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,080
to check out with they finally select

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,700
the size they get the logos and they

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,320
don't realize the logos are buttons so

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,889
they click three times on the actual

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,419
title before exiting the page so you can

00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,220
see from this recording that they're

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,760
confused by the logos they don't

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,580
understand there

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,410
button and they are also confused by how

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,090
they need to select a size before they

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,430
can get a dealer for checkout so this is

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,470
one one failure in one area that where

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,680
we're trying to reintroduce that that

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,840
new button it's a little more clear

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,150
here's a mobile one and so the mobile

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,820
one here is again keeping in mind that a

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:49,060
user has to select a size and a color to

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,720
check out a product well this is a - I

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,760
don't recall a peninsula in the US but

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,620
just one size fits all right so you

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,120
can't actually select a size which means

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,040
you never get a dealer which means you

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,600
can't buy that product online so again

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,790
by having the user recordings were able

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,130
to uncover quick little bugs and make

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,760
fixes on those so this user couldn't

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,800
purchase that product and it's good to

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,960
find those failures because we're also

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,390
we can implement changes pretty quickly

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,090
it's also good to uncover things that

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,040
are successful so here's a user this is

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,710
on the VIP sites this is a user shopping

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,980
around and we had just read just

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,270
introduced a recommendation engine so it

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,790
was neat to see that this user is

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,260
shopping around for a jacket they get to

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,210
the cart page and then we show the

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,730
recommendations and it's neat to see the

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,170
user actually interacting with those

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:42,820
recommendations and adding those

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:44,800
particular products to to their bag so

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,810
again it highlights the things that are

00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,030
also working on the right hand side does

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,040
a column there and what that's giving us

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,720
is a lot of detail about what's going on

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,000
from that user so we can get what

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,280
country they live in what device they're

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,680
using what operating system and version

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,050
of operating system what browser and

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,750
version of browser and so what we found

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,970
is that when we're running into bugs

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,650
work we take tickets in JIRA and we can

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,630
attach these recordings to the ticket

00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,730
and our developers can then fix these

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,260
bugs a lot more quickly and efficiently

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,680
because they understand exactly what's

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,680
going on

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,280
so it's important to remember that

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,950
things are going to fail that's the

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,090
nature of software and so having good

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,770
customer

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,590
you know customer friendly sales points

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,660
is good to help kind of reduce customer

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,700
frustration so here's a couple that

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,500
we've introduced on on the Overmyer site

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,150
so the 404 page we put the content

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,740
you're looking for no longer exists when

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:44,540
you have a 1980s jacket and we've got

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,160
four authenticated users the course

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,450
you're trying to take lies outside the

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,460
patrol area so trying to keep that

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,360
theming going throughout the entire

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,920
experience I really wanted to talk about

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,990
process because we have a two-tiered

00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,290
estimation process where we go from wire

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,670
framings and sketches into the topping

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,810
and then development of course there's

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,420
no time for that

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,800
if you're interested in process my

00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,710
colleague is doing a talk tomorrow at

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,720
10:45 in room 314 and it she talks for

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,460
an hour about how changing our

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,190
estimation process took our project end

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,550
game from WTF to ftw and it's very

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,050
thorough in terms of how we how we do a

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,490
run a project from start to finish and

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,950
how it's transparent for our client and

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,160
how they're involved in the whole

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,410
estimation process so here's what we've

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,120
learned how good baseline data again we

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,100
didn't have ideal obvious line data but

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,430
we've gone back to make sure we we get

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,100
that be proactive not reactive it's

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,040
possible understand the metrics that

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,960
matter to your particular project

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,390
consider external factors so in our case

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,120
it was weather and in marketing efforts

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,790
and low stock and definitely test your

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,920
assumptions thank you for your time

00:26:52,790 --> 00:27:00,059
appreciate it and open some questions

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:03,059
[Applause]

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,059
