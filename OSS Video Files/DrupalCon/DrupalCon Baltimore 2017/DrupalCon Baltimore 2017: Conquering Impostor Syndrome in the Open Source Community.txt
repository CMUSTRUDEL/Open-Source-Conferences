Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Conquering Impostor Syndrome in the Open Source Community
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	"I have no idea what I'm doing."

"I don't belong here."

"Everyone else is smarter than me."

When you're new to any field, particularly a rapidly evolving, ever-changing one, it's normal to experience feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt. However, for many of us, these feelings continue well beyond the beginner phase, even after we've become successful in our careers.  The persistence of self-doubt and fear of being discovered as a fraud despite evidence of achievement and success is known as impostor syndrome; and although it can happen to anyone, it most commonly afflicts high-achieving women, minorities, and other groups that are more likely to feel as if they don't belong.

As female web developers and a female tech director, we will share some of our own struggles and strategies to overcome impostor syndrome, such as: 

Getting comfortable with making mistakes on your way to success.
Finding your own voice and support networks within the community. 
Recognizing your ability to contribute, whether it's code, presentations, or mentorship, no matter what your job title is or what level you're at.
Advancing your career, whether it's within your current company or when you're job hunting.
Heather Rodriguez (Engineer at CivicActions), Kat Kuhl (Director of Technology at CHIEF), and Sarah Thrasher (Senior Front-end Developer at Acquia) have previously presented this session at BADCamp and NYC Camp.

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,559
front-end web developer at civic action

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,050
I started my career in Drupal around

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,730
2009 ish I was actually a student at the

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,440
University of Maryland majoring in

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,860
English and decided hey I don't want

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,070
start so I took an internship started

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,300
doing some HTML CSS got a job as the

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,949
College of Arts and manage the

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,329
University of Maryland then worked my

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,629
way into government contracting and Here

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,149

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,140
like Heather I majored in liberal arts

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,790
I actually majored in u.s. foreign

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,040
policy in the Middle East and as you can

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840
see I am currently solving that crisis I

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,119
guess I don't know as we speak every

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,650
week so instead I ended up going into

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,850
development which is something that I've

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,759
learned was a little bit younger and

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,320
clearly uh ended up trimming it's my

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,290
calling so I've been doing Drupal since

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,799
about 2009 I've been in the Drupal

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,430
community more actively since about 2012

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:35,310
I'm sergeant crasher and developer

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,000
aqueous and that's amore story I - and

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,000
reward

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,240
Thank You moon I tripped away for doing

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,740
design and then I actually wound up

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,590
doing web dev WordPress to the Drupal

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,930
grant so we all free our friends from

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,909
the Washington DC meetups being we all

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,880
have worked at one point or another at

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,100
Rock Creek which is now chief and we've

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,680
given this presentation several times

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,050
now the first was a nice camp and bad

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:15,250
camp at 2015 and here we are

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:17,080
Trypticon 2017 so impostor syndrome if

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,660
you find yourself much like this

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,580
adorable Bowlmor Trevor thinking god I

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,950
have no idea what I'm doing and any

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,019
moment that the fraud police are going

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,090
to find me out you may be suffering from

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,130
a posture syndrome imposter syndrome is

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,890
defined as the inability to internalize

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:37,120
one successes and achievements despite

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,010
evidence to the contrary so if you are

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,320
constantly plagued with fears and

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,380
self-doubt and inadequacies you may be

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,750
suffering from imposter syndrome so

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,090
imposter syndrome is not to be conflated

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,410
with being an actual beginner everybody

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,110
when they're at the beginning of their

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,269
careers feel inadequate and like they

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,970
may not belong in a room full of experts

00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,530
that's just called learning being an

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,380
impossible feeling like you are an

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,980
imposter is when you have evidence to

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,630
the contrary there's you maybe you moved

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,079
up the ranks you've got multiple

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,579
presentations promotions you know

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,670
successes under your belt but yet you

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,900
still feel like you are junior and

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,140
you're just waiting for the other shoe

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,140
to drop

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,720
imposter syndrome is also not being a

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,420
failure so just because you feel like

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,310
you may be imposter news flash you are

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,310
not alone it's not unusual for people

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,440
who have made their way up in their

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,030
career to feel like they're imposters

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,920
this a phenomenon it's not it's not a

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,799
this phenomenon has first studied in the

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,360
1970s by a pair of researchers Pauline

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,430
Clancy Susanna

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,640
and they studied a group of successful

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,340
women in various specialties that had

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,070
PhDs that were respected professionals

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,600
in the field and yet they all felt like

00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,240
they had somehow lucked their way into

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,810
their jobs and that they didn't quite

00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,060
belong so the read this is particularly

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,160
pernicious when you belong to an already

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,500
underrepresented group you know if

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,150
you're for example a woman you are also

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,250
being held back by the fact that

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,810
societally you don't quite belong in a

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,739
group and so if you're help holding

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,750
yourself back

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:26,520
it could be doubly damaging to your life

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,430
so how can impostor syndrome affect you

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,500
for people who suffer from imposter

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,670
syndrome frequently they can burn

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,270
themselves out because they're

00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:40,000
constantly working long hours and

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,800
overcompensating for their fears and so

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,660
which leads to higher stress and burnout

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,400
from either their job or the community

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:51,940
and yeah burning out gotcha

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,520
also you may choose to self select out

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:59,340
of pursuing advanced job opportunities

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,320
and higher salaries and so you really

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,600
may be limiting your overall wages in

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,850
your life and access to leadership roles

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,669
when in reality you can do the job just

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,150
fine and which this is bad for both a

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,980
personal and professional level because

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,020
you are basically excluding yourself

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,010
from leadership position in your job in

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,810
the community so like I mentioned the

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,190
community could lose your voice you

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,750
belong in this community every one of

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,400
you right here is a member of the

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,560
community whether you feel like it or

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,760
not and at this con in particular I

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,910
think we're talking a lot about

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,470
diversity and inclusivity and so if you

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,240
share your knowledge and experience

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,919
you're really contributing a valuable

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,979
talent and resource that open-source

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,250
community so good news impostor syndrome

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,930
is just a trap once you realize it just

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,910
like this little cat you're going to be

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,860
able to get out of the box and Italy

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,940
yeah no it's no cats

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,940
hopefully we're harmed and making

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,240
so one of the first things that really

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,090
helps you to learn to cope with this

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,490
feeling is realizing that it's not just

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,490
you feels like this is some sort of

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,500
psychological thing that you pick a lot

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,100
but people feel a play from a lot of

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,240
difficult life and one of the reasons is

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,570
because you're pulling yourself up

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,380
against ridiculous standards that

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:25,780
basically nobody actually means and if

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,960
you continue to pull ourselves against

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,310
this this sort of standard that isn't

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,540
really immutable you're never going to

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,680
you're never going to do it and you're

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,780
always going to feel like you're falling

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:41,020
short you need to forgive yourself for

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,060
having these types of feelings and start

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,060
giving yourself tools to cope with them

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,630
when they do pop up in work or community

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,000
situations one of the things that you

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,460
might do to avoid being in a situation

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,590
the triggers these type of feelings is

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,750
the overly professiona stick you might

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,580
spend extra time looking over your post

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,320
a glass-like before you put it up at the

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,630
poor class or a patch

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,400
you might just be putting in tons and

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,020
tons of hours at work like seminary or

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
weeks regularly to sort of prove

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,560
yourself to maybe even just herself

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,660
nobody is like asking me to do this kind

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,680
of thing and yet you continuously do

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,910
this to try to fight the feeling back

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,320
and the reason the main reason to

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,150
forgive yourself this and susta is if

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,070
you are actually out here building real

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,990
websites trying to solve problems for

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,460
people you're going to make tons of

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,919
mistakes this just means you're out

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,740
there doing your job living your life

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,260
with and learning things and the quote

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,389
here from you know Damon is actually

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,689
really interesting there's a link here

yeah yeah he's talking about here his

00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:08,269
like personal feeling was that despite

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,429

00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,610
give it up cause he's not a real offer

00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,289
it's amazing like how many different

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,539
types of people and backgrounds and

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:32,810
oquawka life have the same types of

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:34,819
feelings the one of the interesting

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,899
things about imposter syndrome and the

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:41,569
software community is there's kind of a

00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,909
interesting high standards there's a

00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:45,949
single demands of a genius programmer

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,980
where if you if you picture sort of like

00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:50,720
who you think of as like a real hacker

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,360
it may be you know kind of it's like

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Mark Zuckerberg type of 20-something

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,779
young white male you know sailing

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,870
through Cal 3 like taxes weekend started

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,250
like two or three companies and you know

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,839
runs around like black hoodies and

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,189
stickers all the time like what Sun

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,319
Valley and so if you're if you're know

00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:15,860
comparing yourself against this sort of

00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:18,379
like legendary type of person like you

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,879
may actually mean some of those type of

00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,769
criteria personally like it's not like

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,939
nobody does any of these things but so

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:27,290
many of us do not fit these classes and

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,759
you know every every industry kind of

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,269
has something similar to this it's not

00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:33,630
always programming but oh you shouldn't

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,400
be holding yourself up against

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,440
standard and you shouldn't think that

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,320
all these people around you are actually

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,930
that when in reality you know we're all

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,340
human we all come from backgrounds so my

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,350
first ever community about cements and

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,850
I've been doing Drupal since 2009 first

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,480
time actually went to an event is in

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,930
2012 I was Maryland camp in Baltimore so

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,070
down the room that way probably and I at

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,230
the time which is a really technical

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,210
project manager I wasn't technically a

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,850
developer but I had built sites and

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,290
Drupal and so I showed up and is

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,450
expecting that because I was the project

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,890
manager and not a developer I was going

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,440
to spend the entire time meeting these

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,450
people who were crazy good at and that I

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,840
was going to be immediately shamed and I

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,210
don't know thrown out probably so I was

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,520
really helpful for me was this event

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,890
that they did to kick off a camp we got

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,780
to fall in an auditorium and had us

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,760
raise our hands and then lead them up

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,040
for the things that we had done with

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,570
Drupal so far so I think the first one

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,170
was logged in to Jerusalem and edit

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,660
content okay I've done that building a

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,430
content type building a new building

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,410
views with arguments which was like the

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,500
retro and contextual filters for triple

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,880
six the while ago and then doing theming

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,830
and then finally doing module

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,900
development so I decide my hand down

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,470
hill pretty much the end of the sorting

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,580
sorting hat activity so I ended up kind

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,960
of getting sorted into the advanced

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,700
track and learning that even though I

00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,110
come there prepared to really have no

00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,310
idea what I was talking about and just

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,620
be learning from the people around me

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,150
not only was I doing fine there were

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,160
people who could actually learn from me

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,700
and it went a long way toward breaking

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,470
down this idea that you know I was not

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,970
deserving to be in that community of

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,820
developers and ultimately led to be

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,680
going a developer route in my career so

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,060
I would definitely advise getting out

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,500
and talking to people especially if you

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,780
do have that experience you guys are all

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,580
actual huh so presumably you are talking

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,930
to people in the community but it's

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,760
really valuable to share notes to them

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,810
and talk about what you know what they

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,110
know and where you can help each other

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:34,440
and so another moment for me that was

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,470
really illuminating was at a boss in

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,810
Austin Rubicon 2014 I believe so there

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,750
was a box with all of the major

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,090
me fee maintainer zat the time so I had

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,890
currently just been in the top school of

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,540
John Alden route you know I thought like

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,060
everything you know that he had said was

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,410
gold and then all of a sudden there's

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,880
all these other team maintains and they

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,070
can't agree on what the best practices

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,560
are and you know and I'm like oh man if

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,000
these experts can't figure out what we

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,740
should be doing I can't agree on it like

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,040
what what makes me think I can and so

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,990
just by demystifying the experts I think

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:15,750
it helps to realize like that you're not

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:18,240
doing it's poorly good luck so the main

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,130
takeaway here is it's not really fair to

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839
compare yourself against people who you

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,850
know may or may not be way ahead of you

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,980
or people who work something long behind

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,630
in just learning the best person to

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,589
compare yourself against any other time

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:35,190
is path you you a year ago and how you

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:38,400
come along and how you're doing now so

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,529
the photons green is from salsa proposed

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,670
from South by panel where people were

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,120
talking about the experience of

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,190
especially being a minority in their

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,660
universities and like feelings and tests

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,970
pressure to be the best person in the

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,320
room I'm realizing that comparing

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,790
themselves to where they were a year ago

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,070
was going to have way way more fruit

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,080
highly recommend taking a look at this

00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,850
article but then as you start tearing

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,260
down your unrealistic standards it's not

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,150
enough to say I'm not going to compare

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,680
myself to anything you have to find some

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,930
way to measure what they're doing how

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,000
you're progressing in your career so if

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,200
you feel like a problem regularly if you

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,830
feel if you're making the safe all the

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,360
time which we all are unfortunately then

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,190
it's really important to start lobbying

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,390
the accomplishments that you have rather

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,220
than focusing on the mistakes that

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,050
you're making the more that you shy away

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,520
from opportunities because you're afraid

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,170
that you're going to end up failing at

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,780
it the less opportunity you have to

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,490
genuinely rack up those accomplishments

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,040
so this is important in particular for

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,589
people who are Impostors because it's

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,720
one of the major books I strongly

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,910
recommend that I kind of laid it out the

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,600
inability to recognize and internalize

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,370
the accomplishments that you're

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,589
is the various parts of impostor

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,690
syndrome this is the point the fact that

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,949
no matter what you rack up you still

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,870
look back on it and say well that

00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:52,269
doesn't really matter or you know they

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:57,100
would have said that to anyone or that

00:13:52,269 --> 00:14:01,589
award with space so a BuzzFeed has like

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,589
these my favorites through the charts

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,389
there are like they're damn you should

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,529
all go look at them expects what you

00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,880
have an option syndrome you start

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,019
telling yourself and when you get this

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,850
positive feedback where these

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,920
compliments who ever saying anything

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,120
nice to you is either it's like they can

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,500
see you're struggling and they're just

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,240
trying to be like oh you're doing super

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,730
well to encourage me but not really

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,589
meaning it or that they are your mom and

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,279
dad and they have no idea what you do

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:28,360
for a living

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,860
my yeah circle is real so it's really

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,899
hard when you are taking away the

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,339
credibility of the people who are giving

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,709
you this positive feedback because it

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,290
keeps you in that foster that sad

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,360
adorable cat so you start getting over

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,240
that by keeping more conscious trap as a

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,639
recognition that you receive many many

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,740
moons ago when I was a web police are

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,620
kind of starting out the field I had a

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,660
mentor rich Panzer and he told me that I

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,759
needed to start to contracted email by

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,009
God from clients who were saying you're

00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,689
doing a great job of contract or bosses

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,670
saying that I was doing well or

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:04,149
co-workers being like thank you to make

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,380
my week so my basic reactions that who

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,380
was very skeptical

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:14,350
my favorite presentation my reactions

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,910
really skeptical because I felt like for

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,340
one thing it was really touchy feeling

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,140
for another thing I felt like you kind

00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,060
of get your thing to do to get positive

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,570
feedback and then immediately silent and

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,040
a folder and thirdly I felt like I can't

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,630
you don't let that all the time we don't

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,830
mean anything it was a really great

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,120
example of being a popper

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,710
so I ended up doing it anyway because he

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,690
wasn't giving me feedback on how to like

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,490
become a more actualized person which

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,950
would have all seven side he was giving

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,750
me feedback on how he loved it my job so

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,450
I also really did keep the solder I did

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,330
use it to make an argument to move up

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,460
from restaurants project coordinators to

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,170
project manager and it ended up being

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,400
helpful for me professionally but I

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,870
think more important for me was the

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,760
psychological benefit of being able to

00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,710
love and say look I am doing well at

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,170
what I'm doing this is not like you know

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,880
imagine of fictional advancements that's

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,610
good for the day-to-day stuff but there

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:11,460
are also some bigger occasions that are

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,750
are also hard to kind of internalized so

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,120
if you get an award and your immediate

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,040
reaction is that words really easy to

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,400
win or that awarded for participation it

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,530
becomes hard to internalize the fact she

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,410
wanted it all it has its reactions I got

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,690
nominated and then won an award and my

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,000
astral projection at the time was wrong

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,950
after gigatons to everybody so this

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,910
resonated with me a lot rather than

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,620
focusing on the fact that I've been

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,240
nominated by people who worked with me I

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,600
was thinking that the contest was like

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,550
rigged so if you talk yourself down like

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,430
that there are other things you can do

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,710
to internalize that achievements so that

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,360
immediate reaction of if I'm keeping

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,800
track of stuff that people are saying

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,870
about me that's good I'm getting

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,990
compliments or or so that makes me

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,670
insert a lot of people have been

00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,410
socialized

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,660
feeling like it's better to be humble

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,310
you don't want to come across sent or

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,650
nobody like somebody who likes to talk

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,329
about themselves but like honestly

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,070
there's nothing wrong with feeling like

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,810
you did like a good job it's just like

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,790
you did you know you're working hard at

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,130
your job on your project or whatever you

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,620
did and it's great to people want to

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,910
come and tell you they did a good job

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,480
and people feel good about doing you

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,079
that's you

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:27,870
so like why blow them all um the science

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,610
here these are here Larry Hogan donut

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,080
blog and she's the director of

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,340
engineering at Etsy and she's also

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,990
written a few books one of them's a

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,870
really good book on from an informant

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,270
and the thing she does here is whenever

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,090
she has an accomplishment here career

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,290
such as speaking at a conference getting

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,170
a book deal getting a book published

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,910
getting a raised actually she not just

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,170
goes out and buys herself some kind of

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,090
trees and enjoys it

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,740
she puts it up on this blog so that

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,630
she's accountable for friends co-workers

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,150
for having you know celebrated something

00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,660
she did and that's a really great thing

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,100
to try because it is actually

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,960
uncomfortable to be gratitude and

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,490
grateful to other people for and I'll do

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,430
you or even committing yourself if you

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,380
get something cool and if you do feel

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,910
like that there's a big awards there's a

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,310
day-to-day accomplishments one of the

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,300
hardest things for people to do

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,700
gracefully I think they feel like fraud

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,930
to just accept some verbal feedback they

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,110
get in person

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:25,140
gracefully if you have ever had your

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,660
manager come to you and say any and say

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,310
hey great job or I really appreciated

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,050
your work here or thanks for turning it

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,030
around so quickly and you probably

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,100
recognize one of these responses at

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,350
least these are really common ways to

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,840
react to recognition I feel like you

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,460
don't deserve it so no big deal or you

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,020
know Sarah's and most of the work even

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,810
if you were work is really critical in

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,250
that I see project managers do this a

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,900
lot well that's where they'll say oh

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,340
well the team really you know the team's

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,210
all work you're like you manage your

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,010
project take the phrase okay you don't

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,350
just happen

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,550
very real fast my personal favorite is I

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,930
just googled it because I swear

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,370
I had a dollar for every time I heard

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,710
this I would no longer have a need to

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,480
work we are all developers we're all

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,580
just googling as we exhibit those

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,170
matters as well like it's okay

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,520
it's really important to be able to

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,490
retrain yourself to say thank you

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,830
basically for a couple reasons one is

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,780
that if you constantly have that flow of

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,520
negative down top going it's going to

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,840
get harder for you internalize it and

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,630
then it's going to get harder for you

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,550
when you're in an interview to say not

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,020
to say well that was no big deal that

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,370
didn't really matter and try to shrug

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,410
things off and not call attention to

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,570
your accomplishments in the interview to

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,300
really hurt you professionally and the

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,100
second reason is that as a manager if I

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,810
go to give someone feedback regularly

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,580
and I tell them hey you're doing great

00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,060
and loving your work and they keep

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,550
replying to me by saying you know that's

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,960
not really either I have to conclude

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,210
that they are totally disconnected from

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,740
reality or that they actually did just

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,630
google it and there were weapons value

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,430
points do not put your manager in that

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,870
position invest and learning how to say

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,580
things that I don't help you by

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,590
retraining your brain and it'll also

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,510
help your career in other important ways

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,820
so we've touched on this before but

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,760
another really important aspect for all

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:16,060
three of us in getting over or rather

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,000
managing let's set the bar low in tosser

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,600
syndrome is getting active in minutes

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Drupal community so whether that's been

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,420
speaking at conferences or kamd

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,540
for contributing documentation patches I

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,850
help to organize bad camp now I created

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,290
a triple users group at the University

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:40,930
of Maryland but either whatever whatever

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:45,040
rock you take to contribute it really

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:48,880
helped us feel a sense of that we were

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,260
valued among our peers and also the more

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,840
concrete evidence that you start

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,300
accruing whether it's you know speaking

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,820
at the cons or contributing code or

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,230
whatnot you really can help reaffirm

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,420
your sense of accomplishment so that you

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,110
don't fall back on a subjective value

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:08,800
but rather concrete achievements

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,720
so I mentioned that I built my own

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,490
support network at the University of

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
Maryland and that was really critical

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,680
because we would meet monthly and we

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,320
would sort of have this place outside of

00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,370
our job in which we could talk about you

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,170
know the challenges that we were facing

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,450
and provide support for one another

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,040
engine you know give each other demos

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,870
and maybe like catch on to cool things

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,400
that other people were doing and I think

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,670
it's really important to have an outlet

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,500
that is professional outside of your job

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,180
because you need to be able if you're in

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,640
a posture you probably need to get beers

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,370
and you need to have a place to express

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,670
those without any judgement or you know

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:48,520
retribution possibly from people who

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,080
could influence your career so so that

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,230
was important for that aspect and also

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,800
just being perceived as a leader in my

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,170
local community it was really it helped

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,510
me actually own my and learn like I

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,890
had to actually start learning about the

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,200
things that people were coming to me and

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,180
asking me questions about but then I had

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,320
to assert some point acknowledge that I

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,660
knew what I was talking about because

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:18,480
people kept coming to me and asking me

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:21,130
questions another important aspect is

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,930
finding somebody that you can teach and

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,520
you're probably sitting here and saying

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,710
I don't have anything that I can teach

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,650
and I would tell you that you're

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,170
absolutely wrong my the first person

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,120
that mentored me when I told her years

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,290
later that I considered her a mentor she

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,460
kind of laughed she look I don't know

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,640
what you're talking about

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,530
but when I started out my career and I

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,090
was like using this Adobe Dreamweaver

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,060
crap and I was like you know I don't

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,730
know how to make you know CSS work yeah

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,440
and she you know a lot of people were

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,420
kind of impatient with me and they're

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,620
you know is she Megan Wang in the

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,870
College of Arts in humanity she

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,150
dedicated so much time to sit down and

00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:02,680
help explain things and help me like you

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:04,540
know came these HTML websites and it was

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,730
through her guidance and her mentorship

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,340
that eventually I started the Drupal

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,960
users group I was able to gain enough

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,060
confidence that it helped propel me

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,460
throughout my career and I would not be

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,740
here today if it wasn't for my men

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,880
and almost everybody here that had stuck

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,010
with doing through for contributing back

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,080
story about like showing up branches and

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,360
electrical ladders and having somebody

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,890
welcome them and at least being a

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,919
friendly face and showing them the ropes

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,360
and that could only be you and it's also

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,950
very likely that you have genuine

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,450
expertise that you can contribute to

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,130
people as well as being that friendly

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,500
face and that helpful person for them

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,510
it's really common to hear people say

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,679
that they can't help others that you

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,120
know but wait I mean I get what you're

00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,380
saying but you you're trying to talk to

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,559
just like skilled people you're not

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,900
trying to talk to me and there's really

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,250
interesting anecdote about the finance

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,760
world actually that has been very

00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:00,789
applicable to this we found the story of

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,710
a finance group in private equity and

00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:05,110
venture capital really laughing at that

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,990
phrase right in time where they were

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,450
putting together a mentor-mentee program

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,220
for women and the woman going around

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,260
organizing it talking to different women

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,640
and saying hey can you participate you

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,179
know we have some mentors you need some

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,090
mentees

00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,980
come and be part of this and she kept

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,409
getting the answer every single time

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,330
wait like I would love to participate as

00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,220
a mentee but I don't have anything to

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,289
offer anyone and finally she started

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,909
telling women like look everyone is

00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:33,280
telling you this including the high

00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:36,909
level managing director of a venture

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,260
capital firm like I you guys have things

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,169
to offer each other and you're just not

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,870
seeing it so it's really interesting

00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,039
that even when you do get the top even

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,690
when you reach a point where you

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,760
genuinely cast your net for people

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,480
others you still feel like you don't ask

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,260
you don't deserve to be where you are I

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,990
in 2012 at Google

00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,429
13:14 thought 2014 in Drupal con I had

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,039
just been promoted to director of

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,900
technology at chief and I was about to

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,150
give a presentation and I was so

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,950
terrified that I would get up there and

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,020
talk about technology and have someone

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,760
realized that I straight-up did not

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,340
deserve to be where I was that I thought

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,370
my presenters to take my actual title

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,740
off slide and fortunately lost that

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,500
argument in any year since then I have

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,539
tripled the size of our psychology

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,549
like multi-million dollar contracts and

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,590
I clearly deserve to be where I was but

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,110
I was completely incapable of

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,000
internalizing that at the time so there

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,500
are tons of stories from women and from

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,840
them like that's around the community

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,510
where people don't realize how much they

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,940
can offer people around them you can see

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,140
that by just sharing your time your

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,720
experience with people who are

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,159
struggling by just making the space for

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,860
them to come to you and talk to you

00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,950
about what they need you can see that by

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,059
reviewing code and presentations

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,700
whether that's front-end code or

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,740
back-end code or contributing and primp

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,659
and even always blog about what you know

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,039
sometimes just writing down a problem

00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,630
you're having putting it on the internet

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,880
so the next person having that problem

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,860
why doesn't your blog post to be a

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,049
phenomenally helpful thing to contribute

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,850
other people who are struggling and then

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,500
getting all the comments saying like you

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,970
just made my life it's definitely going

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,620
to help you with that feeling on your

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:21,840
own as well you can also speak and this

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,510
is probably one of the hardest ways to

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,980
share your information and expertise

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:31,620
with a room if it's really hard to get

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,940
in front of people and talk about things

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,980
that she can contribute because we were

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,559
always picturing someone on the back of

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,000
the room saying look what makes you what

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,490
makes you worthy to top this topic about

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,900
to me you guys can get up and say that

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,970
later so I got this advice from web

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,070
chick the triple core maintainer

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,539
DrupalCon

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,460
to speak and I looked over my shoulder

00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,679
to figure out who she was talking to and

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,600
wound up speaking and finding out that I

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,429
really enjoyed it and discovering in the

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,409
process that it's not really about being

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,210
the foremost expert on every possible

00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:07,070
topic it's more about picking something

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,179
I'm doing your own spin on it so um

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:17,400
spoiler alert you try your instant on

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:19,590
topic yeah yeah so actually I think it's

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,240
important to note that so I talked to

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,620
multiple people up and then like oh you

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,990
should really speak and they always say

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,909
yeah but I'm not the expert and as

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,409
somebody who is listened to multiple

00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,150
experts speak I can tell you that

00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,560
sometimes they are the most boring

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,410
presenters ever

00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:38,000
and really it's not always about being

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:40,320
so you know the person that wrote the

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,750
like wrote the software or whatnot it's

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,400
about being able to take a complex topic

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,860
and break it down into smaller pieces

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,410
that other people can understand and so

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,460
for example I gave a presentation in

00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:55,650
2014 at that camp a kick-ass success I

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,780
think we also gave it a gov con as well

00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,300
and I had gotten a feedback from several

00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,980
people that it was the best presentation

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,470
that they had seen on set that they

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,180
finally understood certain aspects of

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,790
stats that they just weren't getting and

00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,540
I know like I've had that experience

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,390
also with talking to Sarah one day I was

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,290
having a really hard time understanding

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,720
interactive rebasing and other

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,610
complicated get workflows and I talked

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,860
to Sarah for 15 minutes and she was able

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,390
to break something down that you know I

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,830
had read from all the blogs and talked

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,350
to multiple people but it's just about

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,350
how you can reach an individual person

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,690
sometimes that it's like exact not

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,090
knowing the thing in and out is exactly

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,070
what people weave from you when you're

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,200
giving a talk they're coming in there

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,300
but like a fresh slate you don't know

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,190
and now if you don't realize that that

00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,050
thing you've been staring at constantly

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,240
for months is a little bit confusing so

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,870
with that could be a really good angle

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,370
to come in and speak on something from I

00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,710
have actually personally done that the

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:03,300
first time that I gave a talk for

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,910
anything was back in like 2012 ish and I

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,410
wanted to use like the Omega theme on a

00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,080
few projects but I've never used it

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,730
anything before and in order to get

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,290
familiar enough with it to suggest it

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,690
whether it was

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,700
I actually started researching it on my

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,470
own or like a little class site and like

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,490
taking screenshots and notes of

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,710
different things I had to do to get

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:24,010
things to happen and it's not like I

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,260
came in here and with life you know hey

00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:29,120
it's gonna be hot it was really just you

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,160
know here's my experiences with this

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,930
thing and you know this was kind of

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,210
tricky but the team look at this you

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,920
know and I took all these lives that I

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,590
had worked on and I went to Maryland

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,940
camp and I was terrified that somebody

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,220
was going to ask me some crazy-ass

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,240
seeming question and really be like know

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,630
what you're talking about

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,700
and I gave a talk and I actually got a

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,840
lot of like interesting questions had

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,020
conversations with people came up

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,330
afterwards it was a big relief and it's

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,130
really not a bad reason for getting a

00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,690
table you can really engage people in

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,310
this stuff and speaking of someone who

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,960
was in the audience when Sarah gave that

00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,150
talk I had no idea what their first time

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,860
seeing she was really prepared to newer

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,210
topic inside and out she put a lot of

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,100
thought into her slide so I just showed

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,050
up excited to learn from her a lot of

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,550
times the judgments that you project on

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,660
people in the audience are just not

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,550
anchored in the way that people actually

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,260
perceive your presentation so as long as

00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:22,820
you're prepared people can end up really

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:26,030
connecting with it and so finally we're

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,730
going to talk a little bit about how the

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,890
you need to take responsibility for the

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:36,230
trajectory of your career because in

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:38,570
reality nobody else will and so there's

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,800
kind of two traditional ways to respond

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,900
to feeling like a fraud

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,730
even you're either burning yourself out

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,250
to predict prove that you belong in the

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:48,260
community and at your job or you can be

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,120
passive about pursuing advanced

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,420
opportunities and they're kind of two

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,780
sides of the same coin but this holds

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,420
you back

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,710
whether you want to find a new job or to

00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,140
move up at your current place of

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,690
employment so the first thing that you

00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,920
should do when you realize hey like I'm

00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,510
suffering from imposter syndrome and I

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,150
want to make a move whether it's moving

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,890
off at my company or finding another

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,290
company is you really need to start

00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:14,980
doing your research and so the first

00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,270
thing that I suggest is to seek out

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,760
supportive work cultures that would

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,230
promote a healthy work-life balance for

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,180
example if you know that you're somebody

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,920
who's just prone to overworking yourself

00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,990
find a place that values giving you

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,890
vacation that's not going to push you

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,470
and you know to work extraordinary hours

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,820
you know a place that promotes equal pay

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,290
because you know that you're not

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,900
particularly good at advocating for

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,700
yourself or negotiating and you know

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,270
it's also really important is there

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:47,180
diversity or is there a monoculture and

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:49,250
so in addition to that type of research

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,980
often it can be very difficult to

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,350
establish reasonable salary expectations

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,330
when you're fighting that internal urge

00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,540
to hold yourself back and think I'm not

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,390
worth it so taking the emotional aspects

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,100
out and just talking to people about you

00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,020
know what what are reasonable salaries

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,840
from where I'm at and looking on

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,550
Glassdoor looking at any other research

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,570
that's available will help you get a

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:17,000
number that you that you feel that you

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,070
can confidently ask for rather than you

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,130
know just something that you feel like

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:24,290
you're worth and another thing is you

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,270
would want to look at your network and

00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,620
find some referrals like see what other

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,500
companies are doing and where you might

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,120
be a good fit the last point I would

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,830
make about doing research is that when

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,420
you're doing your research don't just do

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,100
research for the job that you want next

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,530
but think about the job that you want

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,780
after that so that you're constantly

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:45,740
looking to move forward in your career

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:47,450
trajectory if you do want to move up as

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,250
a company that you're currently at you

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,370
have a couple you know a lot to think

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,270
about one thing is where you want to be

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,220
immediately and what kind of expertise

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,110
you have and the other is whether or not

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,240
your company has room for that you

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,620
should be able when you realize that

00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,270
there's somewhere you want to go talk to

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,680
your boss and say look I know I'm

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,180
currently doing front of development job

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm interested in going as a senior

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,200
developer job or you know UX I want to

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,930
move up senior US and have them respond

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,300
to you not necessarily with pool here

00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,860
here is that job enjoy but certainly

00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,750
with we want you to have this much

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,580
experience we want you to have taken

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,840
these kinds of projects so this is going

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,360
to give you the opportunity to go in

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,560
that direction or to tell you we're not

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,690
going to be hiring this or that for a

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,660
while and you genuinely engage with you

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,980
on that most of the time you may be

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,230
sitting there thinking that if your boss

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,790
doesn't approach you and hold out that

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,070
opportunity and you'd be like Heather

00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,690
would you like to do this what you may

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,340
think that you don't have the room to do

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,810
that and the simple reality is it

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,210
usually the people who are vocal about

00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,810
this the people who express their

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,160
interest in taking on that

00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,750
responsibility are the people that

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,300
manager is currency when they need more

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,310
responsibilities taken on it supports

00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,330
also very possible that when you start

00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:58,130
having that conversation

00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:59,600
your boss will look at you and go and if

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,070
that happens then you maybe think about

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,660
very seriously about whether that's a

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,570
job if you can continue to have upward

00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,130
momentum act now if you wind up faced

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,379
with this situation it doesn't

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,320
necessarily mean that you were at a bad

00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,300
company or even bad job sometimes this

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,970
is just like and interpersonal thing or

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,070
a stage of life I'm saying where the the

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,230
situation is just not right who you are

00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,669
what you want you know maybe you would

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,080
really like to work somewhere that like

00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:26,840
enables you to contribute code back to

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,360
your project or you need to be on the

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,080
other coast for mental health reasons

00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,140
and everyone

00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,760
to work in the office see or you know

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,250
there's there's a number of reasons why

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,980
situation may not be a good fit and if

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,810
you feel like the role that you're in or

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,410
the place you're in isn't working out

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,540
for you

00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:47,270
the way to get through this isn't to

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,520
first up into the job and work extra

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,140
hours and just sort of hope that you're

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,010
going to get a raise the job is going to

00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,420
fall on your lap and longer that you're

00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,820
getting to that for the situation it

00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,610
kind of cycles your resume can get sale

00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,960
your portfolio make sure to get sale and

00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,780
it gets harder and harder to make like

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,510
it moves to can benefit you you kind of

00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,480
get stuck and you need to forgive

00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,710
yourself for that and actually reach out

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,190
to the people that you've been at

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,180
working with in some situations when

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,970
you're really liked in talking yourself

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:23,180
this is the only way that you thinking

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,800
before positively you if you have a

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,230
posture syndrome it's very difficult for

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,540
you to you know self evaluate okay like

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,540
that would be a good fit for me and

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,460
people that you know are going to tell

00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,350
you now look we have all these positions

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,020
that you would be great for come on upon

00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,430
them and like literally I would not be

00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,190
at aqueous with all my own initiative

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,750
because there were like a few job

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,570
situations I was in don't assume I'm

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,160
talking about you but there was at least

00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,780
few job situations I was in where I was

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,810
like you know this is really working for

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,250
me for XYZ reasons but I was always like

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,400
you know I'm not really

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:01,430
acqua Tyrael so I wouldn't have ever

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,170
liked out my resume on my own but people

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,030
who have worked with a previous job or

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,910
previous projects or like you know hey

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:14,120
we're looking why don't you try this out

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:15,500
and now go for it yeah once you do

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,130
decide that you want to move on it's

00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,870
important to be realistic about the kind

00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,730
of jobs you can do but not be realistic

00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,380
in a negative way there's really

00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,940
interesting hewlett-packard internal

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,140
report on hiring

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,359
then women approach this process

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,770
differently I found that women wouldn't

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,359
apply for a job and Lessing that a

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,339
hundred percent of the qualification

00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,990
hasn't been more likely to apply thing

00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:39,950
that interview Asakusa

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,750
so the author wanted to obviously wrote

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,539
for the Harvard Business Review found us

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,740
and said like wait like I'm a woman and

00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:47,119
it's not that I don't think I can do the

00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,770
job it's just that I think that if I

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,059
apply I'm going to waste my time because

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,640
no one's going to take a second look at

00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:54,859
me and they theorized the reason this

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,390
quote made the rounds like wildfire on

00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,069
the internet is that it was a wake-up

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,049
call that not everyone is playing the

00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:02,960
game that way and the more that you know

00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:04,190
that other people are not other people

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,839
are not self electing out of

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,329
opportunities the more freedom it gives

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,579
you to do that so in my role as director

00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:12,680
I make the hiring decisions for a

00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:14,539
technology team and to tell you that

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,730
what we do think really seriously about

00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:18,710
the job descriptions we put together if

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,119
someone comes and says like look I don't

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,770
know how to do that one thing but I know

00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,359
how to do these other things you haven't

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,220
listed that is something we still

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,250
consider it's also worth keeping in mind

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,079
that plenty of place is not you know

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,789
especially large firms they might have

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,799
job descriptions written by people in HR

00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:35,510
not written by people who are actually

00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:37,339
human to work so don't let job

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,109
descriptions scare you out from it being

00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:42,619
really seriously about what you want and

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:44,690
then go in really prepared talk in your

00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:46,039
interviews about what you know not what

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,900
you don't know have to consciously

00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:50,779
redirect the conversation in that way

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,170
it's really hard if you feel like an

00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:56,359
impostor it is really hard to when you

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,250
get that quest when you're dreading you

00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,049
know if you know this technology not

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,940
just kind of crumble and be like no I

00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:04,640
don't know it but I really love to learn

00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,710
and then sort of let it fizzle out and

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,869
it's much much more compelling if you

00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,220
can say no I don't know that but let me

00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,599
tell you about a time when I learned a

00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,400
new technology and the benefit it

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,690
brought my team this is why I feel

00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,730
confident that I could pick it up here

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,950
and contribute to the team

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,559
the more that you go in thinking about

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,599
why you are a great hire the more you're

00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,590
able to tell that story so to have this

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,090
list of your day-to-day recognition

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,950
if you have a list of your bigger wins

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,450
if you've been consciously focusing on

00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,730
not down talking yourself in that way

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,410
you're more capable of walking in and

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,270
having the conversation about the person

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,800
you are and where you contribute rather

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,990
than this person in your head who is

00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,120
like sucking into every single

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,100
opportunity they have and you only have

00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,130
these successes successes because they

00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,510
charms their way in it's easy to feel

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,550
that way and it's hard to get your way

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,530
out but if you focus consciously on

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,900
we're training yourself in that way you

00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,220
can eventually be able to kind of shut

00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,050
down a lot of your imposter syndrome

00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,960
feelings okay

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:05,520
everybody together yeah what do we say

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,990
to do impostor syndrome nice today so

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,180
thank you guys very much for the

00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,100
attention we are really happy to take

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,170
questions and if you do feel like an

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,730
impostor and like still kind of mind

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,560
repeat the community highly recommend

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,210
the Friday sprint these are the times

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,980
which will be up here and please also

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,050
feel free to give us feedback and

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,260
connect with us on the Twitter on the

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,260
Twitter

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,520
[Music]

00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,900
so there's a microphone there but it's

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,270
also a really small room so I feel you

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,430
should raise your hands and you smell

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,030
super I was like we will repeat it in

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,630
here

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:44,400
I think over here in French so thank you

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,090
for the talk when you have people on

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,100
your team that clearly suffered from it

00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,410
soon when they stuck on something like

00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,450
this display like examples with how do

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,030
you usually approach that person and you

00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:00,180
ever have such a fast life but if you

00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,250
ever have that issue like hopefully to a

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,050
manager so two-part question the first

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,490
part is if you have people on your team

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,680
who are displaying impostor syndrome

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,210
tendencies how do you deal with it and

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,790
second do you ever feel that way with

00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,590
your manager yeah I would say okay well

00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,940
first thing I would ask you is like what

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,500
is your relationship to that person on

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,690
the team because I think that that would

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,830
you know influence the dynamic and I

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,300
would say if you're talking about a

00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:24,780
co-worker that's kind of you know and a

00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,220
lateral to you I would you know tell

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,080
them that you're receptive to talking

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,880
about it and instead when you catch them

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,920
doing the negative like I just did this

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,770
I just did that you know stop them and

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,990
say say thank you

00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,150
yeah it's okay to point out I think

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,829
you know and let that person know that

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,920
you're a safe person to talk to

00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:45,930
I also add so personally because I know

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,059
that I felt like this way the way a lot

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,680
in my career I'm very likely to talk to

00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,270
people when they say I couldn't do that

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,670
I can't do it on that project and say

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,290
hold on actually you know you can you've

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,150
done it on these projects and this is a

00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:59,190
great growth opportunity for you and

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,819
kind of try to help them see that they

00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,230
can grow rather than like I try not to

00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:05,640
yell at them for negative self-talk and

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,869
instead focus them on what they have

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,140
contributed that has been really

00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:11,970
positive I also think it's so internal

00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,280
that like there may be some people who

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,200
have sort of like obvious like low

00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,819
confidence in their interactions but a

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,500
lot of times you might not realize that

00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,940
you're dealing with people that have

00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,530
these feelings because they really do

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,960
just keep it inside and it makes you

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,970
just feel bad but your interactions with

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,430
other people are still strong and nobody

00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:32,880
would ever call you on this and in terms

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,200
of upward I would say mostly consciously

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,369
stopping the negative self-talk which

00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,960
again you're dealing with your own

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,450
manager don't say I have no idea what

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,390
I'm talking about it's a poor move

00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,579
generally and one that I have made a few

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,559
times in my career so I think it's

00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,109
really focusing on your narrative and

00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,670
how what's where you're growing and then

00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:52,230
also not being afraid to say look where

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,119
would it be helpful for you to have me

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,740
grow my skills more in the future

00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,200
it's a confident question and bosses

00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,730
react well to it it really is making it

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,079
about what the business needs not about

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:05,910
your own insecurities so it comes to

00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,740
worked out pretty well thanks for the

00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,970
talk this is really cool too tempis I've

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,359
been doing a lot of technical stuff so

00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:15,240
having something more you know social is

00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,490
really helpful I definitely suffer from

00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,599
impostor syndrome and one thing I've

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:29,040
been learning this is my first triple

00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:31,799
con obviously community obviously after

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,569
the keynote today I was warning that you

00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,309
know one of the biggest parts of Drupal

00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:37,049
is just this community it's like not

00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,430
just software framework it's like all

00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:40,680
the people that are using it and making

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,809
it and one of the parts of that is

00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,700
obviously obviously contributing to it

00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:46,890
like with toad

00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,980
as you can probably guess someone with

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,720
imposter syndrome

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,660
the hard time even knowing where to

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,220
start with that and you know obviously

00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,220
there's like people coding and I want to

00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:00,010
I want to possibly help but it's really

00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,109
hard getting over that hump of like you

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,640
know how can I just like oh you should

00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:05,140
take this code because obviously I know

00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,359
what I'm doing and you should make it

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,800
part of your big software packages been

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,100
around for 17 years that I just started

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,100
using a year ago you know it is it more

00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,260
about asking for the forgiveness of

00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,200
boots I didn't do good code I'll fix it

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,940
or asking for permission and waiting and

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,840
getting good before you start or just

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:27,730
you know fail early fail oftentimes oh

00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,310
yeah going really well collect yeah I

00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,020
know so for the reporting the short

00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,250
version of that the really great

00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,170
question in long form

00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,400
sorry guys to compare it is that

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,840
basically when you are wanting to

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,150
contribute to Drupal and be part of the

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,800
community if you're showing up to those

00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,270
events and then feeling like you're you

00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,920
don't have the expertise to contribute

00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:47,920
how do you get over that how do you not

00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,369
feel like you're giving bad code to a

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,930
17-year project um I came to you people

00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:57,460
have contributed bad code before but we

00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,500
do have like it was on the board there's

00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,660
there's two two events up here one is

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,190
the first date River Bar second one is

00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,030
the mentored course Brent and I think

00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,580
the really important thing about

00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,190
sprinting is the whole point is do not

00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,090
be afraid to ask for help do not feel

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,220
that asking for help

00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,560
makes you less of a coder like that is

00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,480
exactly what open source is about nobody

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,720
knows it all nobody knows every little

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,890
subsystem of Drupal and I guarantee you

00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,380
that the Sprint's are not going to be

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,359
judgy about what you're putting up and

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,030
it's all about talking to other people

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,090
collaborating sharing and getting stuff

00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:33,340
fixed and no single patch is the product

00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,960
of any one person there are tons of

00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,400
people who help put code up there who

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,080
got to test who helped write

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,230
documentation which is also a very

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,430
important contribution and yeah I'd also

00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,390
add that you're going to make you're

00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,950
going to make mistakes you're going to

00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,750
get some patches rejected it's going to

00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,070
stuff what you do but then you'll like

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,080
in the process of doing that you're

00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,260
going to learn more about the products

00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,790
and feel more

00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,950
we're able to contribute to it there's

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,990
always the point when you are a beginner

00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,100
with something that is brand-new that

00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,570
doesn't mean that you don't have the

00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,340
aptitude to learn quickly and move

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,570
forward so giving yourself permission to

00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,920
make mistakes is going to lead to you

00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,810
ultimately being stronger Drupal

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,550
developer and a stronger contributor so

00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,200
I advise you to go into anyway it's also

00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,210
not like you're not usually coming up

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,530
and like writing a module from scratch

00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,480
you're usually helping with a defined

00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,890
issue and people are really good about

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,410
kind of monitoring the issues that go

00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,770
into those friends so hope that that

00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,270
answers your question ah thank you it

00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,310
also like the comment is a module

00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,540
maintainer we're really restricted in

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,190
the time that we have to do stuff so

00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,990
we're generally really thankful for

00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,000
people to offer their solutions even if

00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,920
they're imperfect because they might be

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,830
a problem that we might not be able get

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,840
to anyways so a lot of module maintainer

00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,970
is very thankful of any help and would

00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,850
rather help you solve the solution

00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:48,160
yourself even if it takes a little bit

00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,160
longer to kind of fill in those gaps I

00:45:54,580 --> 00:46:00,140
thank you ladies especially for sharing

00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,690
their voice or message and the tools to

00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,980
tell of that I'm going to pay them a

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:07,430
compliment I think this is going to be

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:09,440
the session that I get from welding

00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:21,340
session but it's going to be my favorite

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:24,200
one so thank you very much given

00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,690
questions one dunning-kruger effect is

00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,810
disrelated yeah yes

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,430
and number two um I was one of these the

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,410
first people here it was interesting

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:37,340
because I'd say like 80% of the people

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:39,410
here are males but like first people

00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,330
that showed up 90% of emails and you

00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,300
guys kind of touched on the female

00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,340
perspective that and maybe you want to

00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,320
address that just

00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,960
a little bit in my designated role with

00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,630
weaponry capper two parts of that are

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,730
one designing Kruger effect how much

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,860
influence would that have and number two

00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,720
for men who are in the community

00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,450
supports possible for mens have impostor

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,190
syndrome as well but it is like it often

00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:07,570
feels like a female problem how do we

00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,860
kind of respond that so okay we'll start

00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,720
with Dunning Kruger Dunning Kruger is

00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,490
the inverted impostor syndrome Dunning

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,810
Kruger is when you think that you know

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,590
everything but in reality you know

00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,770
nothing

00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:19,300
so people with Dunning Kruger often over

00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:21,220
inflate their accomplishments and

00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,630
achievements and you know them they're

00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:27,340
called it's hard to tell if

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,450
people are doing that because they

00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,400
really don't know that they don't know

00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,580
or you feel like they have to in order

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,080
to look like a businessman you know or

00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:40,690
woman yeah I've definitely had yeah and

00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,670
the I think the gist of it is it's the

00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,230
same problem and reverse you just don't

00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,570
have a realistic assessment of yourself

00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,700
what you can do so I think that could be

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:53,110
equally damaging but I don't have any

00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:55,000
specific solutions for coping with it I

00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,290
think my advice that would be kind of

00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,870
similar to advice for impostor syndrome

00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,830
I think that getting out in the

00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,390
community and meeting people is

00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,270
important but I do think it more people

00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:06,280
but dunning-kruger effect I think more

00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,480
people are afraid when they it was II

00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,770
feel like imposters they're afraid of

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,180
inflating their accomplishments because

00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,010
they're afraid that it'll be perceived

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,140
as dunning-kruger and that is really

00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,670
damaging so talking people getting like

00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,910
an outside kind of yardstick to measure

00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,870
yourself against becomes really critical

00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:23,740
regardless of which of these things you

00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:25,510
think you may have alright so the second

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,070
question about women suffering from

00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,980
imposter syndrome and whether it is a

00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,360
quote-unquote woman problem is well the

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,970
short answer is no it is not a woman's

00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,130
problem it's an everybody problem but if

00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,110
you were holding yourself back and then

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,510
society in general is also looking at

00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,400
you as a woman and going you know I've

00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,710
had an experience plenty of experiences

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,690
where it's like oh so you're content

00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,190
strategist you're a you know business

00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,690
dead person or you're this or that

00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,100
rather than a web developer if you

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,840
already feel like a fraud and somebody

00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,600
looks at you and points you and like

00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,520
you're a fraud but it's going to be like

00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,410
doubly damaging

00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,590
basically I knew everybody knew I wasn't

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,100
the developer yeah it's kind of a double

00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,200
whammy

00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,760
I think socially there and that's like

00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,430
the main gist of it right so it's

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,710
important I think to understand like

00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,360
that it does affect everybody but that

00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,580
and when it may be hit harder

00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,810
I think it's general anytime if someone

00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,040
who feels underrepresented in the

00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,470
community it can feel harder I think

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,250
that also is usually not helpful advice

00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:24,540
for it like it can it can be unhelpful

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,980
to feel like you need to internalize

00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,450
that as a man because you're like I

00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,110
might have talked to remind posture

00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,550
syndrome like that yeah so I think what

00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,320
you know whatever position you're in is

00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,400
important to be like to be kind to

00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,110
yourself and to focus on your

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,820
accomplishments and to find other people

00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,500
who feel that way and frankly I think

00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,260
that for women it can be really helpful

00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,290
here that men feel that way to go to

00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,760
feel like it's a little bit makes

00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:51,260
everyone feel more sane but people do

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:55,500
discuss it more as a woman problem in

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:57,300
the original study was to do with yeah I

00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,850
was going to say that there's also added

00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,650
socialization that women receive like

00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,000
messages from the time that we're young

00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,130
that I think makes it even harder

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,140
because we're always kind of taught to

00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,600
be nice and be humbles that their credit

00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:12,180
hmm where as sort of a stereotypical

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,550
American male thing is to go out there

00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,620
and don't show any weaknesses so there's

00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,120
does that sort of like to you know sort

00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,800
of flip sides of our socialization that

00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,800
get in the way of being a whole person

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:30,360
so a lot of you guys you've given is

00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,310
about either turning to a mentor or to

00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,930
mention connections community or an

00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:34,370
external yardstick or something like

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,470
that

00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,730
and I don't know or or a list of

00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,020
accomplishments good feedback you're

00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,520
getting and maybe I'm betraying my own

00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,530
impostor syndrome here but what if you

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,690
feel completely lost that advice like

00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,609
you feel like you don't have connection

00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,650
and you feel like you're not getting

00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:50,970
good feedback maybe you are maybe you're

00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,710
just so deep in your own in constructs

00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,539
and robux all this advice it sounds

00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,039
really great but you're like but where

00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:57,240
do I find these things but you're

00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,410
talking about what do I find the

00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,299
connections that I feel like I can't

00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,589
make what do I find the mentorship that

00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:04,140
doesn't feel like it's just happening

00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:08,490
for me do you want to recap the question

00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:09,930
of course if you feel like an impostor

00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,309
and you feel like a lot of these are

00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:15,150
looking for validation from external

00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:16,470
sources it's really hard to feel like

00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,420
you don't have those external sources to

00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,190
validate you what you do next how do you

00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,039
either get them or how do you find a way

00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:25,740
to kind of disconnect to not meet them

00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,559
that's unwise your question well close

00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,660
ok more how do you get those people like

00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,819
mentorship or community feedback or

00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,589
network that can help you if you don't

00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:37,470
feel like you have them already I talk a

00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:39,450
lot I will happily go I can give you an

00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:41,220
introvert answer the thing that's helped

00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,589
me the most honestly is reading books

00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,140
there there are a lot of good books out

00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:49,549
there about this and you know blog posts

00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:52,410
like this is a really common feeling and

00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:53,970
talking about it is the best step but I

00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,609
think reading about it is pretty good

00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,920
and I do think if you don't have this

00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:01,890
network you know you can have this

00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,569
network and it may take some time to

00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,430
build it up you may be going to events

00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:06,900
over and over again and just seeing

00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,000
people and maybe not making such deep

00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,220
connections but it's worth going out

00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,809
there and trying to build this up and

00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,880
you know if you don't have like a local

00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:16,440
meetup already here with like a drive

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,910
you may actually be able to be that

00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,680
meetup group what Heather was talking

00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,079
about at UMD she actually just started

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,359
you know putting up you know hey we're

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,630
going to be here this location talking

00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:29,490
about this stuff and people will show up

00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:35,730
if you know if you don't live on an

00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:37,200
island with volleyball today because

00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,349
there are there are some limitations to

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,059
some of the tricks I'd also add that a

00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:43,740
really good source of that kind of

00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,880
feedback can actually be especially you

00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,740
don't feel comfortable talking about it

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,270
at where you're currently working people

00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,890
who have previously worked with you can

00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,630
be a excellent source for that kind of

00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,279
thing going to someone and saying look

00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,920
what did you value about working with me

00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:57,269
where did you feel like I did a good job

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,789
you know what if you were in my position

00:52:57,269 --> 00:53:01,589
what would you do next I think it's easy

00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:03,869
to under eight how much positive impact

00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:06,839
that has on you especially if you're

00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:08,099
struggling like it can fit it's

00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:10,529
important to hear from someone who knows

00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:13,760
you that you have done good work and I

00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:15,900
think that there are many people who are

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,089
happy to give that feedback once they're

00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,740
asked but that's that it is it can feel

00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:21,750
really isolating and it's hard to not

00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,250
have not feel like you've had that

00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,690
mentor those who at the moment but

00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,849
through more involvement or attending

00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:29,160
local Meetup I think you can find them

00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:30,150
if you make yourself open to it and also

00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,640
I would say that you don't need

00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,470
necessarily a physical meetup really

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,720
there's a gentle slack and like your

00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:38,640
thigh RC and such but like there's

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,930
actually a supportive group of people

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,490
and I'm going to shout out to the Drupal

00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,049
diversity and inclusivity initiative

00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,519
like if you get in that slack channel

00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:46,109
like these people will make you feel

00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:47,640
like a rock star more like seriously

00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:49,529
there there are people will have your

00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,720
back in the community you just you know

00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:53,789
I know it's it's kind of tough when you

00:53:51,720 --> 00:54:00,650
feel like you're the newcomer yeah

00:53:53,789 --> 00:54:03,299
virtual communities are totally yeah I

00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,849
guess for me sometimes I feel like a

00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:07,859
leech like I would like to talk to

00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:13,890
people with you to know for things and I

00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:22,470
appreciate the information they share I

00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:24,509
know this yeah so the question is about

00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,890
if you do feel like a leech if you feel

00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:27,420
like you're taking people's expertise

00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,740
and you're not giving them back anything

00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,910
in return how do you deal with it I

00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:34,019
think we're all lunging for the mic

00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:36,690
right now but I got Rick's my way here

00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:39,000
so one thing I would say is there is

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,769
legitimately nothing more rewarding in

00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,079
my entire career than helping people who

00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:44,369
need it like legitimately other as a

00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,140
manager as a member of the community

00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,339
there is nothing better than talking to

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,109
someone about where they want to advance

00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:51,119
and helping that happen so I think that

00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:52,440
while you might not be giving something

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,089
back literally as and you're teaching

00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,789
them something which can also happen by

00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:59,460
the way I think that there's a very real

00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:00,839
benefit in that relationship to getting

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,039
to help someone else kind of explore

00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,750
their skills through mentorship I

00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,369
wouldn't think of that as a one-way

00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,540
relationship because it is two-way to

00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,610
fundamentally

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,710
burnt ways yeah and piggybacking off of

00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,300
what Kat is saying basically if you're

00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,740
allowing somebody to mentor you like

00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,540
keep in mind that your mentor may also

00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,160
be feeling some imposter syndrome so

00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,560
when you give them positive feedback

00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,360
about like oh hey you just like helped

00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,700
me do this and now I just got a new job

00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,710
or I did this like that you're going to

00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,120
help like reaffirm their own senses like

00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,730
value and then they're going to feel

00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:34,440
better about themselves too so with me

00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:36,060
stop me showing up at senta's make a

00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,310
talk and being like hello I learned so

00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,750
much for you was not just beneficial for

00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,730
me to then get to pick her brain about

00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,020
Omega more it's also beneficial for her

00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,940
to realize she's gone out on a limb and

00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,470
it had been a good thing I'm going to be

00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,880
corny and so you don't really know

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,240
something until you can explain it to

00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,240
someone else

00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:05,430
yeah and oh yeah women women who code is

00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,740
one good resource and there's there's

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,500
groups like that virtually and

00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,330
physically all over the country for

00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,210
various technologies or just generally

00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:17,490
for different groups of people and with

00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,690
that I think we might be getting kicked

00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,190
out of this room in a minute I don't

00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,440
know there's another session in here

00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,710
after up one more question and then

00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,630
we'll call it Thanks

00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:30,300
thank you beautiful comfortable when he

00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:36,210
said his question freezing so we got to

00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:37,950
your question p.m. oh yes so I'm feeling

00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:42,180
pretty very wonderful girls

00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:44,340
yeah that's cu n ni ng k ru ger we're

00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,590
talking to get it done in Kruger you'd

00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,020
be good for me I mean Kruger effects

00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:50,610
versus you know I'm poster sugar and I

00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,319
get that the other day darling Kruger

00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:58,819
effect is just you know result at most

00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:01,249
accepted that other extreme now they're

00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:04,640
like you know content developers are

00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:05,359
more introverted makes time and I happen

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,579
to it like that

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:10,309
I tell them listen are you afraid of

00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:12,589
being an you shouldn't it's

00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:14,650
still waiting to resolve the thing and I

00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:18,769
know you're extremely smart you know

00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:21,229
it's the to full-on zoning Cougars but

00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:23,329
the thing is at the end of the day if

00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:26,079
you don't have an evaluation yourself

00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:28,969
and you can't say I love you to myself

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,009
you can't have a proper leadership

00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:33,289
establish to your teammate to the

00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:35,890
outside because you own is shaky bases

00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:37,789
and you that's not what you deserve but

00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,039
that's the thing you can be an

00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,309
very much in a short term good and kind

00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,189
of

00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:44,179
recapping that some folks at home

00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:48,729
basically the idea that we've done and

00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:51,109
Kruger as done and Kruger is essentially

00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:52,489
wow I'm really trying to reconcile so

00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:55,039
you don't you don't know what you don't

00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:58,609
know so you'll be talking completely out

00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:00,140
of your ass about something right

00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:02,869
JavaScript frameworks or whatever what

00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:05,269
have you yeah the point that I was being

00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:06,650
made was that it's okay to you know to

00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:07,640
be an okay to not entirely to

00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,319
what you're talking about get up and

00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,849
talk about it anyway again I hope every

00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,319
tapping okay and I would say I think

00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:14,089
that there is a level of that you have

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,079
to be okay making mistakes you have to

00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:16,939
get out there and talk about something

00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:17,900
you're not confident about the only way

00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:19,789
it goes in and done in Kruger

00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,519
territories if it's like consistent and

00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:24,229
it's really an issue with like people

00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:25,549
who have no gauge on what they know and

00:58:24,229 --> 00:58:27,109
I think that it's just getting involved

00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:28,640
in taking risks in the community you

00:58:27,109 --> 00:58:31,009
absolutely have to do that if you're not

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,169
comfortable with yourself then it'll

00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:34,640
keeping a challenge for you but

00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:36,559
dunning-kruger to be pretty toxic so I

00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,289
don't know why yeah I don't know yeah I

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,979
feel kind of conflicted about my

00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:44,119
response to that okay thank you and I

00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:46,959
think we're we're in time we gotta get

00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,959
out of this right thank you

00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,969
