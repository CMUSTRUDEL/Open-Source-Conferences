Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Magento and Drupal fall in love: A new way to approach contextual commerce
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	In 2016 Quicken found itself in a bind: They were being spun out of Intuit and had to migrate their cart away from Intuit’s installation of ATG, an aging, hard to update ecommerce platform. Already on Drupal, Quicken turned to another PHP open source platform to power their high-volume ecommerce needs: Magento 2.

Using this case study and our many other Drupal and Magento integration projects we will share everything you need to know to successfully combine these two marketing-leading systems into a killer digital experience platform.

More specifically, we will go over technical best practices for combining Drupal and Magento, share our integration approach decision matrix (side-by-side or headless, oh my!) so you can make the right call given your circumstances, discuss how to make it scale at the enterprise level, and review how to ensure outages don’t impact orders with a tool called the conductor (choo choo, all aboard, train emoji, etc).

We will also share lessons from our strategy team on how to use instrumentation and a proper contextual commerce content strategy to improve the lead funnel and cart conversion on your own projects with this bleeding edge platform.

how'd you get started sorry well okay

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,490
testing alright everyone can hear me

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,830
okay awesome thanks for coming we're

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,509
going to talk about which Magento and

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,889
Drupal at scale we're going to talk a

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,350
little bit about the project that we use

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,690
to do this and then go into some

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,550
technical details of why how and how

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,810
exciting it is my name is Justin and the

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,670
CEO and co-founder of third and Grove

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,710
I'm joined by Mike DeWolf our director

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,930
of engineering and the first engineer

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,189
that we had at certain grove okay so

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,630
we're going to talk about three things

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,590
the project we just for Quicken I'm

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,329
going to explain technically how we came

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,480
to the conclusion to do it with headless

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,860
Magento and then we have some tips if

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,910
you ever want to combine Drupal and

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,530
Magento for this kind of digital

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,360
experience and technical integration

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,070
tips for you okay so what the heck is

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,350
quicken it is personal finance software

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,420
so it's similar to mint if you have a

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,559
mint comic out it connects to all of

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,469
your bank accounts and your financial

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,760
information pulls all that in and tells

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,559
you you're spending too much money at

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,129
j.crew if you're me and makes you feel

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,140
bad about that

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,580
so it's a really great way to just kind

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,549
of like see until you're your financial

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,070
pattern it's regular desktop software it

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,890
was into its first product Intuit the

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,990
company that makes TurboTax it's kind of

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,610
like the Windows for Microsoft it was

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,439
really the first product that launched

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,030
that company it originally came out in

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,650
the early 80s it's one of the oldest

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,259
technology company and brands that's

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,630
still around in the valley so what

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,640
happened is that they Intuit they

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,049
decided to divest Quicken into an

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,240
independent company so quicken is a

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,130
multi-billion dollar company quicken is

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,840
smaller by comparison Intuit has lots of

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,430
different business units and they

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,140
decided to sell it and make it its own

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,970
separate company so all of the sudden

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,439
quicken had to divest itself from a

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,700
whole bunch of technology everything

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,340
from data warehousing to marketing

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,009
automation to CMS to commerce and and

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,850
all that stuff a majority of their sales

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,710
are through their websites so EECOM was

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,420
a really really critical component so

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,509
what they had before was this really

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,579
terrible Oracle econ platform called ATG

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,899
it was really old it was highly

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,430
customized they weren't able to update

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,259
it anymore and releases took two weeks

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,670
to do to production and where they

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,619
wanted to get was something where they

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,540
could release rapidly and put together

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,950
Drupal and Magento a sort of a single a

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,150
single platform

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,220
but they really just wanted to get to

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,569
whatever the technology stack was a

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,920
place where they could do you know

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,650
deployments rapidly they had full

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,970
control it was robust modern had good

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,700
connectivity and integration so that's

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,110
really where they had to get to so the

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,489
first thing that we did was technical

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,200
discovery with the team to try to figure

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,720
out all of the touch points that they're

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,209
EECOM data touches and much difference

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,550
in CMS EECOM touches a ton of different

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,319
systems so you're you're you're looking

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,400
at payment gateway order fulfillment

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,110
that could be Salesforce CRM

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,970
integrations there's ERP there's

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,160
accounting there's Finance essentially

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,470
every department in an organization can

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,450
want some kind of touch point with an e

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,640
comm transaction so you've got a lot

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,019
more complex ecosystem than when you're

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,709
thinking about a marketing website

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,450
experience

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,250
so for quicken that really the key

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,630
requirements were you know leave the

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,549
front and experience the same they were

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,769
already on Drupal as at the time they

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,840
needed to build their store security was

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,700
paramount clicking can't have a security

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,470
issue because they as a product connect

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,420
to your bank and if there's a story in

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,730
the New York Times about how quickens

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,739
website was compromised that that really

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,820
has a material impact on the value of

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,209
their brand which is their entire

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,799
business security was key marketing

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,690
wanted more control over promotions they

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,980
didn't have that with ATG they had to

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,019
plug in with systems like Arvada

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,370
Braintree a valera Salesforce NetSuite

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,410
lots of different back-end systems they

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,370
wanted good robust integrations for they

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,769
wanted to make sure that they were good

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,810
partners I could support the technology

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,390
and they had a crazy timeline of four

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,569
months to to move this nine figure store

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,799
online so why we recommended Magento to

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,989
to the client why they ended up choosing

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,190
it one is the ecosystem so Magento is

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,739
open sourced I don't have to say the

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,200
power of that to this group is PHP has a

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,670
large ecosystem of folks that can

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,410
support it and work on it as the

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,850
technology it's not niche by any stretch

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,220
of the imagination

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,290
Magento has great integration support so

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,170
out of the box and with extensions you

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,519
have a large ecosystem of things that

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,750
you can use to plug Magento into all

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,340
those back-end systems of eight that

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,019
they needed to integrate with highly

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,639
available is highly secure and it has

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:16,440
great sales force operations so one of

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,760
the questions is probably why didn't we

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,019
look at triple commerce for this or why

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,700
didn't we take Drupal commerce for this

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,289
so we did look at Drupal commerce as a

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,870
solution their existing site quicken.com

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,020
was and is Drupal it would make sense to

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,430
plug that in there are really two

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,860
key points that didn't really make it a

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,449
viable solution one was integration the

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,900
integration landscape for Drupal

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:38,419
commerce is really very small compared

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,740
to amateur econ platform like Magento so

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,419
you're looking at a tremendous amount of

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,810
additional work and more work is more

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,569
bugs and the other big piece here was

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,550
scale so this is about 80 90 percent of

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,130
this company's revenue it's nine figure

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,660
revenue this is a massive order number

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,190
of orders per hour per second for a

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,630
minute it's a lot of scale they do a lot

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,039
of their business on Black Friday they

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,319
do a lot of their business on one tax

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:05,000
day and in March to prepare for taxes so

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,349
this is a highly volatile traffic level

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,229
and it needed to be a solution that has

00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:13,250
sort of a proven ability to scale the

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:15,080
other thing is that so I'm really like

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,669
food and I eat out a lot but I have a

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,289
rule or I don't eat at a restaurant that

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,270
does two cuisines it's my two cuisine

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,229
role so if does Italian and Japanese I'm

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,789
not going to eat there and the only

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,500
exceptions fusion but Fusion is kind of

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,639
a fabric routine right so so the reason

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,020
I don't do that is when you try to be

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,270
good at Italian and Japanese food you're

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,860
bad at both so this is the same thing

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,349
with engineering so if you look at

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,580
YouTube when you look for the car vote

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,960
that everyone tried to built in the 50s

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,880
they want the idea was like a boat you

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,530
put your car you put your family in it

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,180
on Saturday so drive to the lake and

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,409
you'd literally drive into the lake not

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,060
for any nefarious reason but because

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,830
we're going to now go boating in your

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,270
car and when you try to make a car

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,650
that's a good car in the boat you get

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,419
something else a really shitty car in

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,539
the shitty boat so it's hard to be good

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,039
at two things and that really is how we

00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,599
think about technology and so when we

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
think about a really great experience

00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,990
platform we think Drupal and we think

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,509
about a great econ platform we want a

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,969
tool that's focused on e-commerce okay

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,710
so technical architecture why did we go

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:10,340
headless and how does it actually look

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,630
like so the infrastructure or the

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,210
architecture that we use for this is

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,789
headless Magento so Drupal serve every

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,289
interaction to the glass a Drupal serves

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,150
every immigrant interaction to the glass

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,880
and it communicates to Magento as it

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,889
needs to via an API so there's never

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,449
Magento is never serving a front-end

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:30,590
experience page so we have primarily two

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,900
different kinds of synchronization going

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,150
on so in the absolute necessity times

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,460
when we need a real-time call to Magento

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,839
we do it but everything else product

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,689
information

00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,789
you know images SKUs pricing everything

00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,219
we can is synced in the background

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,229
periodically both when changes happen in

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,779
either system and also just in a regular

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,429
basis to keep the information fresh we

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,110
catch everything we possibly can in

00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:55,779
Drupal Drupal has a great caching system

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,459
very robust very scalable compared to

00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:00,459
other systems so we cache a lot in

00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,319
Drupal we did need that scale here but

00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,289
like I said in those in those instances

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,419
when we couldn't get around it we did we

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:10,539
did we do make real-time calls the

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:13,329
Magento API is in - in Magento - is

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,550
really robust it covered 80 to 90% of

00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,739
our use cases it's really really good

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,339
when it didn't it was usually us wanting

00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:22,989
to chain sequences together so to do you

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,879
know add something to cart might might

00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:27,789
have taken three API calls out of the

00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,139
box with Magento API so we just extended

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,329
the API which it's designed to be

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,829
extended like like Drupal is and made

00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:34,509
that one API call so little

00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,759
optimizations like that go a really

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,199
really far away for the scale that we

00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,089
needed for this for this kind of thing

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,860
we also separated the data between the

00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,299
two systems and we try to whenever we do

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,329
this with clients we try to mirror based

00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,800
on their organization so marketing data

00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,779
that Drupal's good at lives in Drupal

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,099
things like price skew live in Magento

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,899
those are synced between the two systems

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,059
you only edit it in one place it's very

00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,619
clear where that line is and it's really

00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:58,869
easy to know where where you need to go

00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:01,419
to update zone that but whatever

00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:02,739
information you want to work on um so

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,999
there are a bunch of benefits here one

00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:05,529
with the headless Magento there's one

00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,849
theme not to the theming layers aren't

00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,050
compatible so if you have Magento

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,729
serving like the cart in the checkout

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,249
pages you have to maintain build test

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,539
and deploy to themes simultaneously with

00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:15,099
the headless Magento you only need one

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:17,199
theme in Drupal to test and make great

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,579
nice decoupling of front-end and

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,769
back-end experience you can roll out

00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:22,689
updates to Magento or Drupal separately

00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,829
as long as they're not as long as you're

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,419
not doing something that involves both

00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,639
systems you can do a Drupal update you

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,679
don't ever have to touch Magento in that

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,629
release so you can parallel track things

00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:34,990
in two releases in different different

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:36,669
ways certainly good fast deployments

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,680
with a with a modern system and a modern

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:42,490
platform they're on their their own

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,509
Acquia and from a security perspective

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,920
because Magento's headless it's off the

00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,660
public Internet so you don't actually

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,889
have to make Magento accessible the only

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,750
thing Magento needs to be accessible to

00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,040
or API calls from your known service of

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,870
where your Aqua

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,910
Drupal instances live it's an aqueous Oh

00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,529
from those servers highly secure right

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,730
but you can't make a Magento site more

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,320
secure than checking it off the public

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,380
Internet so that was also a huge win

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,910
with this particular market entry and so

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,829
I really won over most of these I think

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,089
there are a couple of different ways you

00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,040
can do headless and you could do side by

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,079
side there's no answer to every

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,490
situation it was just in this particular

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,529
use case headless made the most sense

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,509
security like I said it was really the

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,490
big massive win here of why we why we

00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:23,199
chose this we didn't want to continue to

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,579
leverage Drupal as a great CMS and the

00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,529
team was used to that and it was a

00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,790
really good robust support for that but

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,810
then also there was some uncertainty in

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,009
the business in terms of where the

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,480
product was going to go so they knew

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,790
they needed to go to subscription from a

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,230
sort of a buy software in a box model

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,690
they didn't know when that was going to

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,980
happen so a nice decoupling between your

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,750
front-end experience and your e-commerce

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,449
appearance would make it easier if they

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,910
needed to dramatically replace extend

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,440
whatever that that EECOM components so

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,180
with a nice decoupling at what they're

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,670
not going to have to re-implement their

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,529
front-end to to potentially Ryoka tech

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,699
something on the back end in a couple

00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:57,069
years when they're when their business

00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,029
changes because their business plan is

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,699
to fundamentally change their business

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,889
model and they have to support it and

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,389
how's it going very well we were but as

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,920
a trailblazers here it's the largest

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,600
Magento to store in the world by order

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,430
volume the site has stayed up it's

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,970
sustained all the levels of traffic and

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,399
the and the integration has stood sort

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,720
of enterprise scale ok so now I'm going

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,850
to hand it off to Mike and he's going to

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,709
talk about some I live so as Justin

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,660
mentioned my name is Mike DeWolf I'm our

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,339
director of engineering and on tech lead

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,319
on a lot of these integration and I'd

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,029
like to walk you through a little bit of

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,709
a some of some of the things that come

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:34,420
up if you're approaching I had less

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:38,019
integration with a platform like Magento

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,819
and Drupal so the first decision to make

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,110
when starting a project like this is

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,209
whether you're going to go the full

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,220
headless approach like we did for quick

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,260
accom or whether you want to do a side

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,259
by side approach and there are pros and

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,060
cons as you would imagine to each

00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,470
headless as Justin mentioned is highly

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,540
secure there's less of an attack vector

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,699
there's less of the surface of the

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,889
website is exposed you don't have to

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,660
worry about monitoring as much security

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,730
between these two platforms especially

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,990
if you can take Magento off the public

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,329
Internet

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,790
there's one platform Bhasin which is

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,760
easier up front and also easier as

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,560
global updates rolled out that can turn

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,510
into a headache if your theming in to

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,029
randomly different platforms that have

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,649
different templating systems you can end

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,660
up with weird discrepancies between the

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,470
two sites that disrupt the customer

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,209
experience kind of inadvertently

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,800
another key point of competitors you

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,709
don't really have to do a full single

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,449
sign-on integration which reduces the

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,089
development effort upfront so that's

00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,130
that takes some of this off and at the

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,050
end of the day you end up with a much

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,660
tighter more cohesive package because

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,490
everything's edited in Drupal as far as

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,339
the marketing team is concerned and they

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,750
don't really have to ever worry about oh

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,540
does this thing I want to change live in

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,449
one system versus the other

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,300
that being said by using Magento in this

00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,790
way we immediately write off the ability

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,250
to use certain Magento extensions that

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,199
have a front-end component so if there's

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,439
a Magento extension that can drive a

00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,000
really elaborate checkout we can't use

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,800
this because we have to recreate that in

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Drupal so it's an important

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,809
consideration when you're thinking about

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,160
this is how much do you really depend on

00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:20,290
perhaps something that Magento can offer

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,269
to you for free because if you do

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,389
headless in that case you'll have to

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:28,360
recreate that functionality in Drupal to

00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:31,839
some extent so I mean also even though

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,910
Magento has a very mature REST API if

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,269
the REST API for Magento was not

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,589
specifically designed for this use case

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,689
as Justin mentioned there are some

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,010
customizations that will recommend and

00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:45,010
I'll talk about that at a later slide

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,420
but if you do side by side then you

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,529
really are using Magento in the full

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,300
capacity like exactly as it was intended

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,769
so we have a list of questions that we

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,569
usually go through when trying to answer

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,430
this question with a client's project

00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,230
and I won't necessarily go through all

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,649
of these but I would highlight the most

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,370
important ones number one is if the

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:08,139
client has a very complex product type

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,920
I'm thinking like a very complicated

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:13,750
build a basket type product or I think

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,380
of a classic example would be like a

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,780
pizza where it gets very very configure

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,120
Abell it's probably going to be easiest

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,460
to use some of the Magento extensions

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,900
that exist in the community versus

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,110
having to build all that functionality

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,390
in Drupal and then to communicate it by

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,380
a REST API so that would be one news

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,930
case where there's really this

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,090
compelling reason to put some section of

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,160
the website in Magento with it serving

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,170
those pages and hopefully you can

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,850
organize your site in such a way that

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,950
you can proxy certain paths off to

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,620
Magento and certain paths off to Drupal

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,930
a common implementation in that case

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,870
might be that all product pages are in

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,800
Magento and the checkout is in Magento

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,690
but the blog landing pages various

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,600
marketing materials live in Drupal and

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,400
we have a nice split that way but if you

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,620
don't have a complicated product if your

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,780
store just has simple products or

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,090
products that are configurable to some

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,800
extent but not terribly complicated like

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,770
a t-shirt that has different colors and

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,280
sizes that that can be done quite easily

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,140
in Drupal through a model I'll describe

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,450
another situation where you you might

00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,740
want to consider using side by side is

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,570
again if the checkout is highly

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,490
customized and this is for the same

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,770
reason there may be situations where

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,110
using a Magento extension is going to be

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:35,190
much easier than recreating all this in

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,750
Drupal and other than that there's

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,940
there's other questions we ask a lot of

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,040
it has to do with how content driven the

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,110
website needs to be if the website isn't

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,460
that content driven it almost makes you

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,740
wonder why we're using Drupal in the

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,910
first place so there's a lot of

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,340
questions that we need to ask to answer

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,630
this question most of the time for the

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,520
vast majority of stores that headless

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,920
model works and so it comes down to

00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,030
preference as you'll see we have a

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,760
little bit of a decision matrix here so

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,260
it's complicated products and highly

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,050
customs check out are really the main

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,290
reasons to go with side by side in our

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,900
estimation based on going through this

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,890
but Drupal will generally do best at

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,870
anything content related personalization

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:22,770
editorial workflow and so as much as you

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,990
can bring these rich editorial features

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,970
to the e-comm experience for the

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,000
marketing team by going headless and

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,820
having a lot of your products and

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,070
nation I'm actually being Drupal it

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,340
creates a better experience for editors

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,610
so once we've made this decision a

00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,560
headless versus side-by-side justin

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,170
alluded to the process of figuring out

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,090
so we have these two systems that have

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,620
two different data stores we need to

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,900
figure out what's the source of truth is

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,930
definitively for the different points

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,340
and we have found through doing

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,530
different integrations not just a

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,020
Magento but with other econ backends

00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:03,800
that this is a time to sit down and

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,450
figure out what the client teams do what

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,550
is the marketing team at it

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,340
what is the fulfillment team at it and

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,490
that's usually the perfect sweet spot

00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,470
for how to separate the functionality at

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,480
the end of most projects we can look

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,720
back and say see how well we did

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,170
basically by the one measure which is do

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,210
these two teams operate independently or

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,990
do they need logins to both systems

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,580
if the fulfillment team can edit mostly

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,040
everything in Magento but they have to

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,570
go to Drupal for one random thing we

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,740
feel like that has been we've

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,640
compromised a little bit of the

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,010
usability of the system so typical

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,310
breakdown like you see here would be the

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,560
UPC price stock level certain legal data

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,900
for example a product that might contain

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,760
hazardous materials this could all live

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,640
in Magento and be sourced from Magento

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,290
and then in Drupal where we have the

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,270
product that would have product

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,200
description that would have product

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:06,410
images SEO keywords promotional slides

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,550
that sort of thing the type of content

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,209
that would go through an editorial

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:13,819
workflow essentially so I'll walk

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,920
through a couple just tips that we've

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:18,439
learned through doing these integrations

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,650
and kind of remember to do now moving

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,410
forward so first one this is very

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,540
important and is there has been a time

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,670
on every integration we've done where

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,530
for whatever reason the econ back-end

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,810
was down for a period of time it could

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,680
be that a third-party provider such as a

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:38,040
payment gateway or a tax tax service was

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,220
having issues and then

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,870
the star was thrown 500 errors and one

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,090
big advantage for example underside like

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,490
quick and calm is that when this happens

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,010
because we have decoupled our front end

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,860
we can preserve the customer experience

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,380
throughout the outage so it's in a

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,900
limited fashion they can't check out but

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,700
there's not a huge disruption quick and

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,640
calm doesn't go down you can still

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,290
browse the catalog and so it's very

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,610
important when building an integration

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,610
like this to build into your

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,350
architecture the ability to do this and

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,970
to think about and have the client

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,550
you're working for think about what they

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,830
want the experience to be a common use

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,540
cases that will show all the product

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,150
pages but the Add to Cart form will

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,340
disappear for a second until the outage

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,080
is resolved maybe on the checkout page

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,660
we do a redirect or we have some

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,720
messaging so this needs to be something

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,270
that the team can turn off if they need

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,280
to or any time there's basically a

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,090
bottleneck so it needs to be thought

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,010
I've been built into the system

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,590
oftentimes in development we're so

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,330
focused on the happy path and we just

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,700
kind of focus on this front end we don't

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:48,330
think about when things go wrong

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,090
another thing we found in certain cases

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,610
we needed to bypass Drupal's form API

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,640
now most of the time I would never say

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,140
this but we had a lot of displays and in

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,970
all these stores that we've done very

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,280
common where you have let's say a grid

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,230
of products on nail and each thumbnail

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,180
has a little Add to Cart form on them

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,310
and what you end up with in those

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,590
situations are something like twenty

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,440
forms on a page that you're trying to

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,810
cache and in these situations you can

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,160
run into storage issues voting that many

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,550
forms especially when someone's just

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,050
browsing they're not using all the forms

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,540
so we've actually found it better in

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,070
some cases select cases to change those

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,250
to be kind of embedded forms that will

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,510
make an AJAX call to an end point and it

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,030
will just help the system scale better

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:37,250
and the site as a whole to be more

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:39,990
cacheable by a CDN or a varnish layer

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,750
make your product structure a plug-in

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,530
base this applies mostly to headless so

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,150
when doing this split between a

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:51,070
marketing kind of display products and

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,610
then this ecommerce entity that has data

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,460
excu price you want to have the ability

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,649
to create different types of products so

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,450
if you imagine a typical product page

00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:03,190
the simplest product in the world like a

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,440
duffel bag or a suitcase that comes just

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,409
in one variety the Add to Cart form is

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,720
very simple it's just a button then we

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:13,179
can go into a configurable product this

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,659
has a parent product but then it may

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:18,789
have five different t-shirt sizes so the

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,440
odds of cart form on that page becomes a

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,269
little more complicated it still has the

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,480
button to add but you need to have a

00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:27,279
drop-down with those five child SKUs

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,289
likewise the logic at checkout is

00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,450
slightly different the simple product we

00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:33,190
just send the SKU to magenta and it's a

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,470
very simple transaction so the

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,360
configurable product at checkout we need

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,179
to send a bundle that has the parent and

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,529
the selected child so we decided in

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,730
order to accommodate these different

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:45,039
types of products and they get more

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,659
complicated some groups bundled we

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,000
thought a plug-in base was perfect

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,710
because we could plug in play basically

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,139
any type of product and all we needed to

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,330
do in our plugin was define the form on

00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,970
the Add to Cart page and then define

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,490
what sort of API logic needs to happen

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:05,799
at checkout so it fits a plug-in model

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:08,440
perfectly very similarly making checkout

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,769
logic the same way most checkouts are

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,320
exactly the same on most stores but it's

00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:16,840
got similar components so think if we

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,210
think of a typical checkout flow there's

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,649
a shipping form there's a billing form

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,500
and there's a payment form and that's it

00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:25,059
maybe a confirmation on three steps but

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,129
it follows the same principle if we look

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,769
at each of those steps in isolation

00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:32,139
there's a form and then there's a submit

00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:34,360
logic that makes an API call so by

00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:36,850
building those checkout steps using a

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,679
plug-in based architecture we're able to

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,809
accommodate the use case where somebody

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,080
needs a fourth step where we add text

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,879
for a gift gift wrapping something and

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,490
adding a special message or maybe it's a

00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,720
t-shirt that has a customizable

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,669
something customizable printed on it

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,919
so by doing this plug-in architecture

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:58,240
we're able to accommodate customizations

00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,309
to the checkout flow and Drupal okay so

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,559
another recommendation we have is to use

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,110
a conductor any time of payment is

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,940
processed

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,400
especially on clicking calm there are

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,559
numerous events that happen right after

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,850
in integrations with other systems so an

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,460
example would be we need to update the

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,200
warehouse ERP systems there is a

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,910
confirmation that you know that goes out

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,970
probably through a third-party service

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,580
so all these things don't necessarily

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,929
have to happen in Magento and we

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,429
recommend that they actually don't and

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,280
that you use some sort of middleware to

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,929
process these things because they're

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,420
non-essential to the actual processing

00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,520
of payment and by using a conductor an

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:39,260
outage in one of these systems will not

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,970
jeopardize the payment itself and so we

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,799
also recommend in a conductor to use

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,110
kind of a queue based architecture that

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,000
grab at MQ so that if there is a failure

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,059
in one of these external integrations

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,059
the the instruction to for example email

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,669
the customer confirmed email is not

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,860
necessarily lost and it will continue to

00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:01,010
preserve that it has that instruction to

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,410
do that Justin mentioned needing to

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,040
customize some of the Magento API calls

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,679
so it's out of the box Magento needs

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,510
separate API calls to add a promotion to

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,370
add an item to the cart to look up a

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,850
customer to add a shipping address to

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,799
the cart

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,429
these are all different end points we

00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:22,340
found that sometimes to process certain

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:24,860
steps so to process like a billing

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,070
address form we ended up having to make

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,770
two API calls and that added latency to

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,690
the process so we highly recommend if

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,480
you're working with Magento to customize

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,669
and consolidate those API endpoints into

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,380
one thing that can perform all the

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:41,419
functions you need with the information

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,790
you have and you can usually almost

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,530
always get away with one API call for a

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,630
check out step if you're doing a

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,429
multi-step checkout like that which is

00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,030
I'm going to speed up your performance a

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:55,220
whole lot and my last slide is to

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,620
thoughtfully plan a cache strategy that

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,660
leverages edge caching it's very

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,929
important in these sites that are econ

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,850
based that as soon as the customer adds

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:07,370
something to their cart and the website

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,320
becomes dynamic ie probably in the top

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,390
right corner there's maybe a cart

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,940
overlay that they can see that you don't

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,100
sacrifice the caching

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,860
your pages as a whole and you think this

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,500
out one common way we've implemented

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,930
this is using like a local storage or a

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,630
cookie to store a cart that can be

00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,570
invalidated by an AJAX call and

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,660
basically the turned off and that's a

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,750
very important thing to do because as

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,520
you can imagine if all of a sudden the

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,660
page becomes dynamic the customer has

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,270
something in their cart and we are

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,220
serving them cold pages the whole site

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,360
slows down just because they have

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,760
something in their cart and the users

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,380
like what's going on so it's very

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,140
important to think about how everything

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,990
can be cached using local storage and

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,260
then you leave it to small Ajax calls

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,260
and then probably the checkout flow that

00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,850
will will bypass the cache and so if you

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,470
design it in that way it will be very

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:07,630
CDN friendly and a very Sippy experience

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,890
we have a white paper and if you want to

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,960
check it out its third and rib comm

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,640
Drupal magenta we talked about some of

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,930
the things we talked about today and

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,320
other than that we'd uh we'd love to

00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,320
take some questions

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,529
