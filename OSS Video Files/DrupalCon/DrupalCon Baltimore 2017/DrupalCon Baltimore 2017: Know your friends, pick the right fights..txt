Title: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Know your friends, pick the right fights.
Publication date: 2017-04-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Baltimore 2017
Description: 
	They say, “Choose your friends wisely, but choose your enemies even more carefully.”

Why would the Product Owner of one of Drupal’s biggest PHP “competitors” in central Europe--Mathias Schreiber, the “Dries” of TYPO3 CMS and the CEO of TYPO3 GmbH in Düsseldorf--be on stage with Jeffrey A. "jam" McGuire, Evangelist at Acquia, one of the biggest contributors and commercial entities associated with Drupal?

There are real threats to Drupal out there. Proprietary software vendors and their allies are still trying to take open source software out of the picture by any means necessary: contractual, legal, or regulatory. We will not overcome them if we engage in endless bickering with other open source projects. We need to be pragmatic and build real alliances with our natural allies.

Everyone in Drupal, TYPO3, PHP--everyone in open source software--is relying on each other to do their part, contribute, give back, innovate, enable, and inspire each other. The more time we waste bickering inside our open source cocoon, the faster our real competition will be at our throats.

In our session, we will address:

Threats--some very specific--outside the open source cocoon
How we can address and counter those threats
Remembering to be open minded: "Be open to being open."
How collaboration is more powerful than protectionism
And how we can make the world a better place--together

the conference I might be speaking at

evangelist and sometimes it's developer

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,079

people in and around Drupal open source

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,600
lots of different aspects of that and

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:28,680
warmth Rubicon welcome from my friend

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:30,630
Matias all the way here from Dusseldorf

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,040

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,000
and do this thing with me whatever so

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,900
Cheers

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,909
I'm I'm Matthias I am a CEO of type of

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,590
three Inc which is the type of three so

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,799
maybe people don't know we're the

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,049
competition much in the sense how

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,700
Doctors Without Borders our competitor

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,500
competiting with you know like the Red

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,270
Cross kind of thing which is still an

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,460
open source also GPL and I have a

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,610
history of like about 17 years in

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,060
open-source right now that's the Twitter

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,060
handle

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,640
and this is basically all the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,790
information you need about me because

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,739
I'm not interesting anyway so we want to

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,660
get you a short outline of what this

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,060
session is about because we've known

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,040
each other for a year yeah we were

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,010
younger we were definitely younger

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,080
before and so we just came up with the

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,569
idea to collaborate more because it just

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,230
makes more sense so what we want to give

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,730
you an idea about in the session is that

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,190
you should be aware of threats to

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,750
open-source software in general because

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,000
those are coming back big time we've

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,780
seen stuff happening in Europe which is

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,790
disturbing to say the least that we want

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,150
to give you an idea how we can counter

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,050
these threats which akh to play the game

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,030
the others play as well we want to hope

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,060
and try to explain what collaboration is

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,950
better than protectionism about your

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,450
code then that's the standard stuff like

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,120
be open-minded and of course stay

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,069
open-minded over a period of time

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,140
because we consider that extremely

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,150
important and in the end we're an open

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,880
source of course we want to do make the

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,950
world a better place right hopefully so

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,430
we'll start with some history and take

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,620
that yes do it so I think that I think

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,470
the first I'd like to sort of underscore

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,959
who Matthias is he's the product owner

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:33,750
of PHP GPL CMS that uses symfony

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,130
components and as the product owner he's

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,790
you know sort of the Driss of the non

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,980
technical side of his CMS in his CMS is

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,299
a big deal especially in Germany there's

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,760
a lot of adoption in german-speaking

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,930
Europe especially and they've gone

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,459
through their own fascinating

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,420
interesting history we'll touch on that

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,760
a little bit but you know in a lot of

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,660
sense of the word typo3 is a competitor

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,180
and we want to talk about in what

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,680
context that makes sense and a lot of

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,299
context that doesn't make sense and this

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,670
is so this is from it is a different

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,670
perspective on the open-source versus

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,550
proprietary situation that we find

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,660
ourselves in all of us

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:22,400
I should do that yeah you should history

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:25,750
of open source so we founded type of

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,370
free like in that works better right in

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,540
1997 so we're going to have our 20th

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:35,150
anniversary in a couple of weeks time

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,220
then we can say that in the beginning of

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,680
the 2000 that was the rise of open

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,320
source software right aside from our

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,380
service run Linux or UNIX or stuff like

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,100
that so your application level became

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,520
open more and more open source in 2001

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:58,700
Drupal showed up which was a good thing

00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:00,830
and well then we considered 2005 the end

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,850
of the open source Wars who who was an

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,230
open source back in 2005 already more

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,680
people than I thought that's a good

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,340
thing for those who were not those were

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,840
the times when you actually had to fight

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,140
to get open source running in

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,240
enterprises I recall we were sitting

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,610
with Lufthansa which is like this huge

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,970
German airline and we had to convince

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,860
the marketing guy to state that he was

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,450
using our open source solution but he

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,580
was well open-source is no company

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,760
policy we won't do it we have the same

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,530
stuff with sa P they said we won't use

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,260
open source and we were like yeah but

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,870
you just released your own open source

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,140
database three weeks ago and he was like

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,050
we did it showed up cold market ok open

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,560
source is cool and and by the way lost

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,760
answer those answers online

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,790
entertainment system now is powered by

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,139
Drupal 8 which is a super interesting

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,819
you

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,720
the media center on the AIDA cruise

00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:08,860
ships powered by tap agree so okay

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,930
that's how we work so and in the end its

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,289
content right it doesn't have to be a

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,090
website of course but still you know in

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,430
2005 there was basically when this

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,380
entire thing you know open source became

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,590
on vogue you were allowed to use it

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,960
officially and basically until now

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,520
that's what we call the golden era right

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,270
you no longer have to complain about

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,030
open source getting into an enterprise

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,099
it's easy to argue everybody gets it and

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,720
this is what we consider well also a

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,900
good thing

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,180
the proprietary market on the other hand

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,220
was basically caught off guard and by

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,990
surprised with the rise of open source

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,849
software it can take a look at

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,099
proprietary content management systems

00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:58,300
in the early 2000s not so cool

00:06:54,099 --> 00:07:01,539
and they were they are too big and too

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,120
slow to turn around and adapt to the

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,130
level of technology that projects like

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,630
Drupal or type of free brought into the

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:13,840
market as well with that with their

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,300
client base there were too bulky you

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,780
know and they were too slow and bulky to

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,240
innovate on their own terms and this is

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,360
why we all do conferences like this

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,870
rather than this 50 people meetups that

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,759
we used to do in the early days so we

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,930
can safely say that we knocked them down

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:39,729
in the mid-2000s but we didn't quite

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:42,130
knock them out yet so if we take a look

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:46,210
what open source did in those golden

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,889
years and what happened so we figured we

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,979
should talk about what we're good at

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:53,050
right you want to do that yeah sorry

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,490
so an open source we're super good at at

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,469
a bunch of things we're really really

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,110
really good at refactoring that

00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,090
component and then rebuilding it in

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,400
another language and then updating that

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,219
implementation and making that even

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,270
cooler super shiny feature to add to

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,310
that other feature that we already built

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,830
we're good at traveling and evangelizing

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,720
and hanging out and you know telling

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,669
each other how great we are right I'm

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,130
really good at building user groups and

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,590
we're you know very very good at

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,580
creating great conferences but like like

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,580
here impressive

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,440
things were not so good at in open

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,180
source depending on the country in the

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,399
community

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,330
we're not the greatest business people

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,029
taken as a whole and I know how to build

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,740
a website and somebody paid me for it

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,540
and hey presto that means I can build

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,970
websites and when I don't have enough

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,370
hours in the day I hire somebody else to

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,839
build more websites next to me and when

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,820
she doesn't have enough hours in the day

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,950
then we hire someone else like that's

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,899
the sophistication of our business

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,250
thinking in many cases and it's not

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,620
scalable and it's not very advanced and

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,600
so but you know it paid our rent for a

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,730
long time I think the time has come and

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,850
this is another talk time has come to

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,709
think further about that we're sort of

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,410
we have some legal problems along the

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:16,640
way trademark issues naming things is

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:19,670
hard right and connecting our stuff to

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,250
non open-source stuff when this could be

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,930
a huge opportunity for us to really

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,329
greatly expand our market and our

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,089
ability to make loads of money right

00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:32,540
which in like I would like that for all

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,490
of us here things were super off you

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,690
wanna do awesome okay I'll do awesome

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:42,350
right so that time the typo3 lost the

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:46,610
bid that we got right how much doom las'

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:49,010
sucks you know celebrating how great we

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,440
are and how piss-poor somebody else is

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,709
we're kind of ultimate that I hate to

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,450
say right we're really really good at

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,490
building our things and doing our

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,320
projects and being on our Island and

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,690
siloed and this is our enterprise

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,020
technology that you may not have except

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,490
for open source right we live we know

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,260
that sharing our code with someone who's

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,470
smarter than we are like then we get

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,180
better code back right so but we you

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,270
know there's been a really long time

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:21,500
when we did not talk even within PHP you

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,810
weren't the PHP dev right you were a PHP

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:29,660
and a typos even a triple deaf right and

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:31,640
so on so not invented here Drupal seven

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,980
right were really good at reinventing

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,750
wheels we're better you know you're

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,630
better than he goes okay we actually

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,960
spend 1.4 million dollars can you hear

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,600
him that work yeah regarding not

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,220
invented here we invented not invented

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,980
here right so we actually spend like 1.4

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,590
million dollars on a team that wanted to

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,130
rebuild the next iteration of typo3

00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,290
which then never came to life and we

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,910
yeah awesome right okay and I'd like to

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,860
point out that the type of community in

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,590
this case he's just as good as drop a

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,570
drama as we are yeah absolutely I mean

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,610
the guys came up with the idea yeah that

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,570
Symphony but will they will build our

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,140
own framework right and it took us from

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,650
scratch

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:24,500
of course starting with nothing right so

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:27,710
we're great at up and right now

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,050
it's we got rid of that we basically

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:32,390
lost six years of development in the

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,950
process because the rest of the type of

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,360
three community and the core team was

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,910
like well we don't need to innovate

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,339
because those guys will innovate right

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,839
and they paid full-time now innovate for

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,930
us yeah yeah so in the meantime the

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,620
sharks that are the proprietary systems

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:56,950
in this paradigm right have not been

00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:00,260
asleep and if you've seen for example

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,060
will get there but if you look at things

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,880
like the Gartner Magic Quadrant like we

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,610
do a taqueria this thing called epic

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,520
server has appeared right up with Adobe

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,040
right up with Acquia and Drupal and it's

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,410
a huge set and their cloud aware they've

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,630
got personalization they are ready to

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,940
scale they've got great marketing in

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,330
place and it's a huge threat because it

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,970
is a very close match

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,350
- aqueous service offering but it's a

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,600
proprietary packages all the

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,709
disadvantages that we understand but now

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,080
we're going to have to go and explain

00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,640
those to clients again we're going to

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,990
have to start selling open source again

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,209
and we haven't really been doing that

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,589
for five years or more because we've

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:42,680
been in this golden age like everybody

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:44,690
knows that open source one right there's

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,120
the module for that there's a module for

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,769
open source one right so they've been

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,050
they've been working really really hard

00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,510
and I hate to say that you know Adobe

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,250
site core a bit server and so on have

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,510
legit some really really exciting

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,860
interesting things that we should be

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:04,820
looking at them they have bigger budgets

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,040
even as of three or four years ago the

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,970
average EW oh I could be like a

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,910
politician of the average deal size for

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,709
Adobe web content management three years

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,450
ago four years ago and there was a video

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,579
on YouTube somebody said this in public

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,959
average deal size was four hundred and

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:27,110
fifty thousand dollars of license fees -

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:31,070
right with services and implementation

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:34,700
on top of that now picture in your mind

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,620
how much Drupal how much typo3 how much

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,110
open-source how much open-source could

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,050
you deliver for a half a million dollars

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,250
right and but we have to go back out

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,800
there and we have to say you know what

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,110
half a million on licenses before we

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,850
figure out if it's going to work come on

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,370
with open-source we're delivering you

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,630
every dollar you spend is a feature it's

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,810
a more beautiful interface it's

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,079
something right it's better but they've

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,329
got much larger deal sizes than we do

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:05,870
and they play dirty how dirty do they

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:07,940
play Mattias yeah this is this is what

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,130
when I stated at the beginning that

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,940
we're having kind of a does that work a

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,770
kind of dire situation in Europe this is

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,649
what's happening so there's a

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,779
recommendation for the entire public

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,610
sector to only use software that has

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,209
vendor SLA that I can see you shaking

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,660
your head clear anyway in Wes injure Wes

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,280
in your

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,190
Western German yeah so that includes

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,830
Netherlands Belgium Francis considering

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,120
it and if you think about what this

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,430
means because this is just a

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,500
recommendation just one line right this

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,060
is ones is one line of regulation whose

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,090
things they understand the consequences

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,800
of requiring vendor SLA or Drupal who

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:52,150
thinks that means aqua is going to win

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,150
all the projects in Western Europe

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:59,300
seriously this is basically what it

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:02,420
means right it's like is this one tiny

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,740
line that includes excludes all of open

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,620
source CMS in public tenders unless

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,210
there's the official vendor of stuff so

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,550
just to give you an idea but service

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,520
level agreements who does not know what

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,450
it is awesome so we can skip those

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,550
slides we'll finish early so the basic

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,830
idea is that the creator of in that

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,080
terms important the creator of the

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:30,500
product has to provide services and

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,360
liability for those products every

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,720
commercial CMS does it because it's easy

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,240
money every commercial CMS marketed it

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,370
so clients start picking it up and they

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,960
go like yeah can you offer services

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,220
agreements for us and you go like no

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,780
because it's open source and you can do

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,550
everything yourself and yeah but the

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,850
other guys sell it and we want that too

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,620
so clients ask for these things right

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,050
they're totally interested in these so

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,360
so with with a CMS like Drupal under the

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,670
GPL we don't have a contributors

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,730
agreement right our contributor our

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,890
contributions are ours and we sort of

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,070
give them in perpetuity to everyone else

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:12,940
but the ownership cloud of Drupal is

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:17,150
very very large and very diverse and

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,550
Acquia as big a service provider as we

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,430
are and the services even if we you know

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,680
Greece is my CTO right we still are not

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,000
the Drupal vendor there is no official

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,190
Drupal vendor there is a workaround that

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,720
probably works no it does it does work

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,310
check them so he's got a hidden

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,850
advantage here that he hasn't talked

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,580
about

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,820
typo3 you saw that find a contributors

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,230
agreement all your software is still GPL

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,020
nothing else changed but you signed a

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,810
contributors agreement that you assign

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,550
all of your rights to which you don't

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,980
have because the GPL okay just like it

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,240
right you a your moon you assign all of

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,490
your rights as a contributor to the

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,410
typo3 Association the nonprofit

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:03,710
foundation hey presto the type of three

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:07,280
Foundation Association focus creates a

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:10,390
commercial entity called typo3 Inc I am

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,460
a Hanukkah all of a sudden and they can

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,740
assign the license to this commercial

00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,130
entity and Matias is the vendor of typo3

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,290
and can apply for the vendors that we

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:24,050
could be cut out of as Drupal service

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,570
players so this might be this might be

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:29,780
something you know it's tricky because

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:32,230
we had to get this idea into the into

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,050
the hands of our community which was

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,690
that's two talks of all along that

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,150
happened it took place but the thing is

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,280
so there are main questions that came up

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,900
within these discussions and these were

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,970
stuff where we were only talking to

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,610
lawyers right nothing else no community

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:54,620
people so who's the creator of the

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,810
software and what happens to the money

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,000
that you make from these things because

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,760
just to give you an idea a lot of budget

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,320
bunk runs on typo3 and they have a

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,220
service level agreement which runs

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,850
around 15,000 euros per month per month

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,890
so that's like three full-time employees

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,170
right these people could work on title

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,060
three score and this is what we do so

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,950
personally I don't have any shares in

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,080
the company I don't make any profit of

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,820
it I'm an employee I'm the CEO but still

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,130
I'm just the stupid employee no

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,900
investors nothing no investors nothing

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:31,850
no venture capital and this was our most

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,310
important questions like how do we stay

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,860
independent from outside money this is

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,180
why we decided against Robert but we

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,610
didn't incite against you but we decided

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,780
to get the father done

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:46,090
no actually excited for it but the idea

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,540
was that that we didn't want any venture

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,120
capital in the company which makes our

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,240
way harder because we don't have that

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,980
much funding to you know like work on

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,140
but we wanted to stay independent from

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,140
every outside influences that we could

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,950
yeah that's your case right right

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,200
general though of the u.s. coke so this

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,470
is not a this is not a you don't call

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,330
them the UN this is a this is a

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:18,630
different legal situation it wasn't this

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:21,640
specific vendor issue but in terms of

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,920
open source having one and proprietary

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,040
now fighting back the the Canadian

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,370
government Canada a brief was was highly

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,980
flawed in our view from from a number of

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,480
perspectives but the RFP was written in

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,430
a way that enforced getting a

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,290
proprietary CMS I think that the trick

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:45,010
was getting user seat licenses written

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,990
into into the into the RFP so you know

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,900
open source where you don't need to pay

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,730
for per user usage right like sorry

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,390
can't do it I think that was restricted

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:58,750
anyway so open source was essentially

00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:02,440
excluded Adobe one there were some super

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:04,390
dubious architectural decisions made

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,990
along the way where it's just way way

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,670
too big and way way too much um I would

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,450
content Adobe lowball to the bid

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:17,620
significantly for a few tens of millions

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,770
of dollars as of mid late 216 delivery

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,080
was that 10 percent overall and the

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:26,110
budget was at five hundred percent over

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,120
the initial bid so you know bad idea

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,710
there's got to be there's got to be a

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,990
point where the Government of Canada

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,030
could consider like just like stopping

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,580
not throwing good money after that and

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,330
trying during through open source right

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,490
yeah so yes so this is a an interesting

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,160
trap where some lobbyists get things

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,950
positioned right and you know this is a

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,149
situation where maybe Drupal would have

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,999
been terrible for this

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:54,039
the architectural in design was was bad

00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:57,190
or maybe we could have influenced it to

00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,779
run differently but you know and we

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,269
could be in just about a position right

00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,529
but you know I want to say I don't think

00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:04,659
we would because I think we're smart

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,099
people and we by definition we use money

00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:07,359
in a very different way in our context

00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,519
right because we're delivering value as

00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,349
we go

00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,009
legal issues this is really interesting

00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:18,909
is this the oh yes so so check this out

00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:21,489
this happened in Germany for real joomla

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,869
which you spelled wrong because the CI

00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:29,200
there's an exclamation point there yeah

00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:31,059
so Joomla PHP open source CMS they do

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,979
things differently than we do with good

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:37,839
people it's open source you know all

00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:39,339
fine joomla association was set up to

00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,839
solve the exact problem that we've had

00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,299
in drupal over and over and over again

00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,889
how do you run a drupal camp and collect

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,479
money and not have it run through

00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:48,700
someone's private bank account and tax

00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:51,129
liability and how do you issue receipts

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,320
right found an association so that you

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,200
can have some community that that's why

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,909
they needed it it's a non-profit and in

00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,979
germany the kind of nonprofit that they

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,440
are by law needs to work for the greater

00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:03,879
good it has to be it has to do it has to

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,499
benefit people

00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:07,749
what's the leak what how do they what's

00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:12,309
the word they used to describe that in

00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:15,399
german - oh okay right it has to be

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:22,059
useful to the broader participating

00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:25,139
right who sued them right so that so the

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:28,539
IRS in germany told them you know what

00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:31,659
we don't see that you're doing any good

00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,279
for society running stupid like geeks

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:36,279
hanging out and eating pizza together

00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,489
like that does not fit our definition of

00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,559
what the greater good is where we are

00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:44,529
going to remove your tax-exempt status

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,239
or retroactively Lee have a nice day and

00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,629
the Joomla Association said wait wait

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:52,989
wait wait wait no no no what did I thank

00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:53,679
the Joomla Association said it's very

00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,999
late in the day

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,440
wait wait wait wait no no listen listen

00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,999
listen wait wait because we do this and

00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,990
you know helping an open source and

00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:02,330
everybody

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,630
you want to do good for society go read

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,700
a book that would meet our definition

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,680
that's the quote by the way this is true

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,620
this is real well it's not a quote

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:18,470
because he said not games in Bhutan yeah

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:23,240
fair enough okay but otherwise so I love

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:25,730
this open source story that Matthias is

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,980
about to tell alright so what was

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,080
happening that the Joomla Association

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,390
started crowdfunding because they needed

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,930
like six grand to fund a lawyer to help

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,940
them win their case and we took a look

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,370
at that and I have to admit that I was

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,500
on the spiteful side of things I was

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,840
going like oh great now Jim is going to

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,080
implode in Germany awesome more market

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,200
share but then I just took a look at all

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,690
the all the transfers that came in it

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,370
was like 10 bucks 15 bucks and then

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,400
there was a hundred bucks which was like

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,140
standing out of that and we did a quick

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,060
call a type of free association and

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,070
basically okay let's let's fund a

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:07,040
thousand bucks with that because this

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,590
might affect us sooner or later anyways

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,570
and the good is that the good thing is

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,180
that we can make a legal case out of

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,520
this that we can then you know like pull

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,100
up the next time the German IRS starts

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,630
trying to pull tricks on us one thank

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,630
you for doing that that's awesome

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:30,180
so and two and two Matthias and and the

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,820
typo3 association cleverly created a

00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,600
legal precedent for defining what is for

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,550
the greater good

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,140
for open-source software community for

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:41,940
all of us pretty much okay so we're

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,110
gonna you're welcome

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,970
so this is like the key component of

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,760
this so i hope everybody is aware of the

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:55,020
threats and the problem that that are

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,790
there so we we discussed why should we

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,500
work together because normally when you

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:02,520
start thinking about working together

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:06,390
it's about this thing right market share

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,250
pie chart games so in order to do what

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,620
we can play that game it's totally fine

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,050
but we should you know this is like the

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,690
standard statement you get all the time

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:19,650
right so people do drupal and they lose

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:23,370
the lower tier to wordpress they lose

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:26,900
the upper tier to us and so i don't okay

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:29,910
so adobe definition of the bad guys here

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,650
so but what you always hear from and it

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,440
doesn't matter if you're in the US or in

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,270
italy or in France or in Asia it doesn't

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,820
matter it's always the same story like

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,890
the market isn't big enough so in order

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,810
to play that well so how big is the

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:51,660
market how big would you estimate the

00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:59,210
Drupal turnover per year worldwide what

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:59,210
are we talking a billion to ten

00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:05,899
we we we did proper research on type of

00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:09,739
three and we're like a tenth of Drupal

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:12,379
size our gross turnover is roughly

00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:16,659
around the billion euro mark per year

00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:19,909
okay so 10 billion isn't that far off so

00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:22,460
the next important question what is our

00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:25,789
market because people tend to think in

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,429
the open-source silo right so they think

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,950
what our market is stuff we can get away

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:33,830
from Joomla or from WordPress or from

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:38,440
type of free or from Drupal and oh you

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:41,779
know this confined space of things and

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,139
if we take a look at the market we

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,869
define it should be the entire web and

00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:50,090
that's a lot more than just the open

00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:52,220
source silo and then we should take a

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,359
look at how much of this market is

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,009
actually covered by CMS at all and then

00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,989
the last important thing this is just

00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:03,259
for the WordPress people screw market

00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:05,749
share think turnover right it's the same

00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,909
thing I think which company runs the

00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:11,090
most cars most cars

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:13,429
I think it's Honda or Toyota

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,009
no it's Toyota so I had the same

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:19,369
discussion in Italy in Bologna which is

00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:21,230
the home of Lamborghini I was like yeah

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:23,149
we don't have the huge market share in

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,100
this country like it's you built like

00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:28,129
this freakin cars which have like this

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,590
point zero zero one margin thing and

00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:34,249
it's like the most incredible car on the

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:36,409
world right so think turnover so we

00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:41,509
brought some charts because we're not

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:44,809
coding anymore so we do charts now so

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:48,970
just to take a look at CMS so or the

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:52,820
entire market we figure in turnover that

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:55,070
70% of the web does not use CMS at all

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,820
and we had you did the session this

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,379
morning where we had 25 people and we

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,549
had two people in the room that says

00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,230
yeah we're trying to move away from

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,080
Dream Weaver

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:09,289
really I kid you not this happened this

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,139
morning we did before this morning we

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:13,669
didn't know that it still works yeah it

00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:17,690
was also there a dreamer that still a

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:20,539
thing and then there's this market share

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,970
which runs on CMS systems and that's

00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:26,539
tiny fraction on top that open source

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,700
CMS right we're not talking market share

00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,380
we're talking turnover revenue being

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,669
generated right and that's where we're

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,870
fighting with each other all the time

00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,630
and that's dumb

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,490
right absolutely we can fight it really

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,970
effectively for the orange and really

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,470
interestingly for the green space that

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,659
would make sense I mean it's it's like

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,580
you go to a birthday party and you

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,690
brought cake right it makes sense and

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,000
now there's more people than you're

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,950
anticipated to come what do you do you

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,529
don't cut the slices smaller you get

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,529
more cake is that how it should work

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:04,370
what happens to my slice does it work no

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:07,130
it works the other thing is you want to

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:10,760
do these everybody's bashing Acquia for

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:14,690
doing so much business right

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:17,000
at least you said so please bash him now

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:21,529
somebody thank you alright so see I cook

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,990
mahomes so if we take a look at proper

00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:27,110
numbers and this is only this tiny

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:30,490
fraction of open source content

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:34,639
management system that's like Acquia and

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,799
all that is not actually a set the open

00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:39,470
source piece of pie right pretty much

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,980
yeah so this this tiny tiny fraction so

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:46,639
there's enough room for everybody to get

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:52,320
like make a good living out of what we

00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:56,139
do and all my animation breaks so I

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,419
here we go so we basically brought like

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:02,470
a synopsis kind of thing even don't know

00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:04,330
the term is right so we are competition

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,519
oh is that where you put that lies okay

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,260
now you've moved it around this is

00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,000
totally not rehearsed by the way as you

00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,139
might have been a believer yell oiled

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,250
machine what are you saying

00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:16,870
yeah pretty much who are you but like I

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,909
mentioned earlier we're competition

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,230
those still fighting for the same thing

00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:25,360
right make make open-source more

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,279
successful in the market in general and

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,590
we have this discussion this morning as

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:35,110
well so people are are they have issues

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,929
with moving from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:40,870
that I hear that a lot

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:43,269
and it's about modules not being

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,480
compatible with Drupal 8 yet you know

00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:50,460
these kind of things and what we figured

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,710
is that that's like the greatest thing

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,470
about open source is that you can change

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,690
it right because if you go for is a

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,250
proprietary vendor lock-in there's no

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,559
way you can ever change these things

00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,440
mainly because you're not allowed to say

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,580
and you don't have access to source code

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,850
and we figured that we should join

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,769
forces on to make open source even more

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,409
successful worldwide because there's a

00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,419
lot of untouched stuff that we can jump

00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:19,360
into and that's basically the entire

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:21,519
divide and conquer approach work

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,909
together get the entire market done and

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,909
after that we can fight not over the PI

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:30,370
but over the entire buffet and then on

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:32,559
our own private islands right right

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,029
exactly so we invite him to type of

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,830
three island and heels going to invite

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:38,980
us to Drupal Island and everybody else

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,860
well exactly and then we can decide who

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,500
takes which part right tech corporation

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,590
right so so this is another reason why

00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,850
we should cooperate the simple reason is

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:53,080
that we already are cooperating there's

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,179
this little thing called the age of

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,340
interoperability in PHP or the or the

00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:01,990
PHP Renaissance right PC 5.2 brought us

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,590
namespaces for the non developers here

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,779
that means I can have two

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,450
pieces of functionality that plug into

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,220
my PHP system and they can use variables

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,929
that have the same name and they won't

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,249
fight which either with each other they

00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,710
won't cause the conflict so I can have

00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:18,139
really radical names like date or time

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,580
or name or something and that works so

00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,460
that's an important that that made it

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:27,710
easier to put different codes together

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:28,970
configure that let us do dependency

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,710
management through a thing called

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,840
composer so we can then we have

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,580
mechanisms to plug in and control things

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,799
that we put into our projects that by

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,409
the way fun fact has anyone ever

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,389
realized that the composer logger is

00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:45,970
actually a conductor Oh see details

00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:49,669
details

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:52,820
yes we should put that in in what we're

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,779
awesome at yes we're awesome at picking

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,429
nits yeah so then we have the PHP

00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:00,440
framework interoperability group that

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,509
started codifying other standards that

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,490
let us work better together they're

00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:08,480
called PSR standards and that let us

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:11,450
create things like the first PHP meta

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,240
project of this era is Drupal 8 we got

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:16,269
rid of a ton of our own code proprietary

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,649
code essentially and replaced it with

00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:20,809
two components with the symphony library

00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:22,249
to handle HTTP request and the guzzle

00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,200
library which is another open source

00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:25,789
library and we outsource that risk and

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,590
we grow our community by doing that and

00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:29,299
all of the things that we have with twig

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,820
and Symphony and all these external

00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,169
components now we're a meta we're an

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,789
umbrella over a bunch of other

00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:36,590
open-source projects the thing that we

00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:38,960
call Drupal 8 is just like the human

00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:43,279
body you know like what is the bacteria

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,169
and what is me kind of idea right and

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,789
then and so and we're super good friends

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,409
with symphony which is a set of

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,179
functional components also written in

00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:53,360
PHP all of this comes together

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,070
we're already cooperating and

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,490
contributing together to all of these

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,429
things

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,860
typo3 is written in PHP and uses

00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:05,960
symphony component and uses composer and

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,820
uses guzzle huh and PS are and and

00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,109
they've implemented a bunch of the PSRs

00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,570
they're ahead of us on a couple of them

00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:14,210
you guys have PSR 7 in place

00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,820
as its handling okay yes so but we're

00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:19,640
not there yet but we're working on like

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,640
we're using exactly we're using the same

00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,429
set of toys right we're just playing a

00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,020
little bit differently um so we're

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,210
already cooperating together these are

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:34,510
our friends this is not our competition

00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:38,030
in almost any sense of the word um this

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,770
was obviously a very stressful slide to

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,310
put together and because we live in

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,580
Germany we we we combatted that stress

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:49,220
with beer now the problem is Matias is

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,040
from Dusseldorf and I'm from Cologne and

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:58,100
those two cities are 25 miles apart

00:34:52,040 --> 00:35:00,500
miles I think and as close friends are

00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,780
with the same set of toys right like

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,730
we're neighbors we hate each other like

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,130
we couldn't even agree on what kind of

00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:10,190
beer to drink so we had to go to another

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,930
city where they drink what they drink

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,360
something else so here are the reasons

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,610
that we've determined are really really

00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,440
good not to work together on knocking

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,440
out the proprietary competition

00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:31,590
is it loading yeah now we thought about

00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,260
what to put there this page

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:43,160
intentionally left blank nothing at all

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:47,940
anyway it looks I think it's good great

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:50,670
okay Jemima's he is a genius on display

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,440
yeah so so actually so we're basically

00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,470
at the end of what we wanted to talk

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,170
about and and one of my questions to you

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:01,920
is what are we missing here like why

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,600
shouldn't we be going to more of each

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,610
other's conferences why shouldn't we be

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,870
figuring out how to make symphony better

00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,060
and how to make our libraries better

00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:11,130
together to make our project status and

00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,710
you know what Matias one Aida Cruz is

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,350
very cool right we want to look stunts

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,910
at this time very cool like we're happy

00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,650
about that it doesn't like I don't I

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,200
don't think there has to be bad feeling

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,600
about this because with 70% of the web

00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,090
that's not even using a CMS at all right

00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,880
we could double the CMS business and

00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,910
there's still there's still room room to

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,200
grow right so so I don't know if you can

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,360
think of reasons not to operate that

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,470
would be important information for us to

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,800
know but seriously

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:43,620
so I'm really hopeful that we were able

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,330
to talk about how you know we had this

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,160
Golden Age we have this Golden Age of

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,780
open source but the competition the

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,870
proprietary competition has not been

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,580
asleep we have to learn to meet them on

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,920
the field and play their games against

00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:58,350
them we feel that collaboration is

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,800
better than protection and please stay

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:05,060
open-minded and please help make the

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,060
world a better place

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,150
right cool that's it

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,150
go look

00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:39,099
yes there was an assumption it well so

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,809
I'm going to give you a longer answer

00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,609
than you expected but we've got a couple

00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:45,069
minutes right

00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:47,619
it was transformational to have a

00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:50,019
website at all ten or twelve years ago

00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:52,239
and a lot of us got into this business

00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:55,959
because we could make a website and then

00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,309
over time Oh an affordable website and

00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:59,200
then over time we could make a beautiful

00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:02,410
website in a functional website and it

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,029
that it is no longer transformational

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,279
just to have a website

00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:10,450
everybody's got a website right and our

00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:12,279
skill set I'm sorry to say it is simply

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,259
the skill of putting code together to

00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:15,519
make a website appear that is also no

00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,859
longer transformational that is also

00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,259
commodity so we need to be thinking and

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:22,569
bigger better business models that add

00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:25,539
actual value beyond the creation of the

00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:26,979
website right so aqueous exemplifies

00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:30,549
this in a number of ways which is easy

00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:33,190
to talk about you know with support SLA

00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:34,719
with security with scalability with now

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,559
with personalization all that sort of

00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:41,069
stuff just like people who build net

00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:44,219
node has built a personal aid and

00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:46,749
inbound marketing tool using Drupal 8

00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,279
called open inbound and I encourage you

00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:50,140
to check it out it's really really cool

00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,339
and it's all built on Drupal so you can

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,499
diversify you could be a full service

00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:56,380
agency add value in a lot of places you

00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:57,969
can specialize by offering products that

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,910
you believe will fit you can productize

00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:02,289
things that you already do all of these

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,910
are great ways to do business and that's

00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:05,410
the story of Oxley that's the story of

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:10,660
platform that story of lots of us in the

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:14,380
community it is very very hard nowadays

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:18,869
to survive in any way as a business

00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:22,390
doing five thousand $15,000 $15,000

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:25,180
$20,000 projects right I mean I don't

00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,549
know where the cutoff is exactly but my

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,799
gut feelings helping me right it depends

00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:32,300
on the country and so on but churning

00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:34,820
out cute little brochure websites is

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,230
longer a business we will the system

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,310
cool drops in cool drops in Belgium

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,650
drops solid is the company they built

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,870
they built their company they wanted to

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:47,120
have more time so they built a cloud

00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,490
infrastructure then they built a site

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,320
spinning machine on top of that now

00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:54,170
they're still not selling Drupal

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,680
websites they sell digital marketing to

00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,990
SME businesses and they tell five hours

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,360
of marketer time and a website and

00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,000
analytics help and campaign design help

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,650
it just so happens they're spinning up

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,390
Troopa websites that look okay and they

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,390
work fine that is not their business

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:15,320
they're teaching for the first time SMEs

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,970
to do marketing that's amazing now

00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
they're doing that based on a system

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,640
that spins up little tiny Drupal

00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,070
websites but that's not where they're

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,340
adding the battery so all of this is to

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:27,140
say web sites now are only

00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,900
transformational if they're like huge

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,250
and give you data and personalization

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,320
and what-have-you or they do something

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,910
else a lot of us don't even need web

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,330
sites because we have Facebook or medium

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:40,460
now right and then we've got Wix we've

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,070
got Squarespace we've got wordpress.com

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,320
and they're really great self-service

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:48,470
tools for making pretty decent websites

00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,700
yeah so our lunch is thoroughly eating

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,900
below a certain budget point there is I

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,850
don't see the point of doing business

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,340
below a certain threshold like just

00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,050
building websites there's no point in my

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,560
view of there's no economic sense in it

00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:11,890
that I just need to do that yeah he says

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:11,890
it's matter so does that right Rick

00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:25,780
right yeah

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,910
and the self-service tools are only

00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,220
going to get better and you know the

00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,350
importance of Facebook where they give

00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,080
you a pages mechanism now that can grow

00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:37,510
right and I blog on medium because it's

00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,460
incredibly comfortable for me right and

00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,560
I have a site and I like my site and I

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,160
still don't post on it because like I

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,870
forgot to update the octo press library

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,550
and then I got stuck because I'm not

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:52,240
really good at Ruby and then you know

00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,040
and one and then you know and I you know

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,440
it happens right but there's a thing

00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,740
that's a service it just runs like it's

00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,690
convenient right so yes the X the action

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,530
of making the website is less and less

00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:07,420
significant and and the survival point

00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,250
get pushed higher and higher up the

00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,310
market which is why don't focus on

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:19,390
building websites go add values for very

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:21,790
long answer but did we kill you does

00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:25,170
that is late in the day yeah it is it's

00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,170
pretty much oh okay

00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,260
yeah

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,849
yeah

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,150
oh okay

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,650
okay so I'll just repeat this and then

00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,180
we can unpick it a little bit because

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,150
it's really interesting he said like

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:07,130
okay we said we should collaborate and

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:08,720
cooperate and not think of ourself we

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,300
can compete for business that's totally

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,800
legit right but he was suggesting that

00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,840
to be proficient at typo3 to be

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,430
proficient at Drupal that there's some

00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,750
really serious skill sets and and it's a

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,340
you know deep learning curve razón like

00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,800
how could we possibly invest that much

00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,860
time right that would be crazy it's not

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,120
what we're talking about right continues

00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,920
like so where could we collaborate PHP

00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,840
framework interoperability group needs

00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,820
help developing standards for us to

00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:39,560
write interchangeable components right

00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,960
you have a which one is the database

00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,030
standard I forget now if you have a

00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,070
standard for storing information and if

00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:49,370
all of our projects store the data

00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:52,790
following this standard the content

00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:58,220
repository PA write PHP CR if we all use

00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:01,010
PHP C are not just theoretically but on

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,770
a pretty damn good practical level if we

00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,630
decide for whatever reasons like I only

00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,550
want to work with tall people I only

00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:11,440
want to work with mustachioed people

00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:14,570
right so I'm moving from Drupal to typo3

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,080
my database still works with typo3 we

00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:20,930
just go and plug it in over there right

00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,840
the content structures work in both

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,060
systems April both following PHP CR we

00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,790
can work together on that standard on

00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:33,110
those implementations to make our mutual

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:35,750
life better off if one of our dumb

00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,240
clients decides to go to them right you

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,750
know no so that's a really and there's a

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,100
ton of it would be dumb that no there

00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,680
are a ton of opportunities in

00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,780
open-source all of the libraries that we

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,330
use mutually all of symfony all of the

00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,010
ways on all of the JavaScript stuff we

00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,960
do it's all open source that we can all

00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,450
go and contribute there we can all go

00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,920
and work together we can teach each

00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,990
other and learn from each other at

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,900
conferences online everywhere there's a

00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:06,470
huge collaboration space right marketing

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,090
right marketing from source market open

00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,230
source marketing okay like doing what

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,780
we're doing

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,430
attached to right there's that too so

00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,120
there's there's a huge amount of space

00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:19,610
for us to be going out and saying vendor

00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,780
login getting a value for money from the

00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,190
first dollar you're spent like all these

00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,440
open-source stories that we need to

00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,480
start telling again look at the Gartner

00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,670
Magic Quadrant Adobe's really strong

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,250
aqueon Drupal's really strong every

00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:34,010
servers come up site core has come down

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,330
a little bit but we have a ton of big

00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,210
fights to fight out there to get the

00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:40,940
big-ticket projects right and um you

00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:43,160
know I'd be happy for you to get one us

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,540
to get one you know trade off a little

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,300
that would be a great place to be in um

00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,710
and we have some confidence because we

00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,120
can look at each other's code we share

00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,510
these components like we can actually

00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:56,150
say with some confidence using this

00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,440
series of PHP CMS is like we know that

00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,510
that's pretty that's pretty good quality

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,030
right you need a service provider in

00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:05,390
Dusseldorf and you need someone right

00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:08,300
there I can't compete with that yeah and

00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,310
if you need people on the ground in

00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,430
Boston right you have more trouble

00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,140
competing with that so so so they are

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,360
great they're are completely ok

00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,710
situations to compete in while we help

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:25,060
it you know we really have each other's

00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:25,060
backs on all sorts of other fronts Dave

00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,380
okay

00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:41,299
yep

00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,270
well okay

00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:02,460
Oh in San Antonio Texas there was

00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:05,370
legislation against the ride-sharing

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,140
business model and lyft and uber drivers

00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,120
came together the two companies came

00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,340
together to fight that to make it legal

00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,380
to practice that business model in the

00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,690
city women he's suggesting that that's a

00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,570
similar a similar kind of a situation I

00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,340
have grave reservations about the

00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:26,040
implementation of the network business

00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:27,120
model in uber lyft case but yes no no no

00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,370
but that's it no but it's a great one

00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,590
like we have common interests a ton of

00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:33,570
common interests and and a ton of common

00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,480
enemies so like you know we'd rather

00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:38,400
drink excellent beer together and make

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:45,600
our stuff better than then fight about

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:47,040
something like yeah no so no so I've

00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,230
been in taxis in some places where

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,210
there's the my taxi app and whatever the

00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,130
local one is and then the uber and the

00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,270
lift like this it's like six things

00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,130
because their dashboard and they're like

00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,350
but and that makes sense as an

00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:09,060
entrepreneur like I'm opening up so yeah

00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:09,780
