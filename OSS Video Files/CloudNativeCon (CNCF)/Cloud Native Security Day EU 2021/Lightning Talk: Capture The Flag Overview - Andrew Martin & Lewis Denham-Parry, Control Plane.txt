Lightning Talk: Capture The Flag Overview - Andrew Martin & Lewis Denham-Parry, Control Plane

Delve deeper into the dark and mysterious world of Kubernetes security! Exploit a supply chain attack and start your journey deep inside the target infrastructure, exploit your position to hunt and collect the flags, and hopefully learn something new and wryly amusing along the way!

Attendees can play six increasingly beguiling and demanding scenarios to bushwhack their way through the dense jungle of Kubernetes security. Everybody is welcome, from beginner to hardened veteran, as we venture amongst the low-hanging fruits of insecure configuration and scale the lofty peaks of cluster compromise!

Note: Registration for Cloud Native Security Day Europe is required to participate in Capture The Flag.
