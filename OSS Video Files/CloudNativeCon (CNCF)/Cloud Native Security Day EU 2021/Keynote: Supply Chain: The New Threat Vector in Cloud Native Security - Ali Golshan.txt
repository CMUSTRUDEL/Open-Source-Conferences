Keynote: Supply Chain: The New Threat Vector in Cloud Native Security - Ali Golshan, Co-founder and CTO, StackRox now Red Hat

At its core, cloud native technologies are heavily dependent on community contributions and developers. As a result, the final stack of tools most organisations run in production are assembled from a series of assets that have been developed outside the organisation. The security and trust in supply chain matters now more than ever. We will discuss how the attack surface in cloud native has shifted from the traditional vectors to the supply chain as well as open source resources, and what we as a community need to do to reduce this risk.
