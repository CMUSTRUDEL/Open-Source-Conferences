Lightning Talk: Namespaces-as-a-Service with HNC and Kyverno! - Jim Bugwadia, Nirmata & Adrian Ludwin, Google

Kubernetes namespaces provide a strong security boundary and allow sharing cluster resources to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. However, enabling secure self-service namespaces is complex. In this session, Jim and Adrian from the Kubernetes Multi-Tenancy Working Group will demonstrate how the Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC) and Kyverno can be used together to enable “namespaces-as-a-service” for enterprise teams. First, Jim will show Kyverno how it can automate fine-grained permission management, enforce security, and generate default configurations. Next, Adrian will discuss how HNC makes it easy for developers to manage additional sub-namespaces without requiring cluster-admin privileges. They will then show a live demonstration of using the two CNCF projects together to enable self-service for namespaces without compromising security.
