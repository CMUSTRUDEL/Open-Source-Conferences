hello and welcome to cloud native

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,000
security day europe 2021

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,440
i am andres vega one of the technical

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
leaders for the cncf

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,120
interest group for security and with me

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,839
hi everyone i'm itai shakuri i'm a

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,480
member in six security and also a cncf

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,199
cloud native ambassador

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,199
we're gathered today with good reason

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
the cloud has changed i.t

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,240
and the way modern businesses are

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
conducted

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,000
it has enabled organizations across all

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
industries to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
achieve velocity and innovate faster but

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,040
with moving faster

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,600
doing so securely and with less risk

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,600
remains a constant challenge

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
effective security is more than just

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
technology

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
it involves people process and

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
architecture

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
for that reason cloud native security

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
day is assembled as the premier

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,960
security day that brings together

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359
project maintainers

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
experts and leading practitioners to

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,159
share their knowledge

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,840
and experience with you all

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
if this is your first cloud native

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
security day

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,560
this is a kubecon co-located event

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
happening twice a year around kubecon

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
and in addition to the already excellent

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,799
security content that you'll get

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
in kubecon which is perhaps geared

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
towards kubernetes

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,840
security in this event you'll give you a

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
broader more general view on the cloud

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
native security space

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,520
we will discuss trends tools

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
ideas and opinions from the cloud native

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
security

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,880
community so we really hope that this

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,320
event can complement your kubecon

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,040
experience as you can see from the

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,840
agenda

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
we have prepared great content and even

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
better lineup

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,119
of speakers you will be hearing about

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
the greatest and latest

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
on cloud native security there are a

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,399
number of breakthrough ideas in there

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,439
but there's also tons of great practical

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
advice

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
the topics range from supply chain

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
security subjects like

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
signing and verification software bill

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
of materials

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
supply chain logs moving

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
on to the noble use of kernel

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
technologies like ebpf

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
cutting edge technologies like web

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
assembly modules

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
advances to confidential computing as

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
well as

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
methods and approaches to policy

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,280
enforcement

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,200
workload identity and serverless

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
security

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
yeah there's certainly something for

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
everyone in today's agenda

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
even for those wanting to get their

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
hands on we have an exciting capture the

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,319
flag event

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,239
going out throughout the day and we

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,920
cannot introduce cloud native security

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,400
day without mentioning

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
seek security which is the group that

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
makes it happen

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
seek security is a group of individuals

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
collaborating under the cncf on a

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
regular basis around the same

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,319
topics that you'll hear about today so

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,200
if you find today's content

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,159
interesting you can get more of it all

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,560
throughout the year

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,280
by joining us in seek security and will

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,599
be very happy to have you

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
as a thai points out this event is

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,239
produced by the community

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
for the community we're here to share

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
and learn

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,599
we're gathered virtually but the

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,159
ultimate goal remains

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,599
as if we were in person network with

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,560
other attendees

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,080
participate and learn from others but

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,840
most importantly

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
