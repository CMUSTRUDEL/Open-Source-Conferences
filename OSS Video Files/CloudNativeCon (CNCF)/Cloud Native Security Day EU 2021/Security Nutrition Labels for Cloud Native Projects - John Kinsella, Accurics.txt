Security Nutrition Labels for Cloud Native Projects - John Kinsella, Accurics

“Nutrition labels” are becoming popular in technology; Apple and Google are using them for privacy, and others are researching their value for communicating the state of privacy and security in IoT devices. In the open-source and cloud native ecosystems, we as developers frequently create software without clearly communicating what it does from a security point-of-view – leaving users to reach their own conclusions on what risks a project may introduce. In this talk, John describes a framework for how an open-source project could define and publish their security nutrition label that allows users to quickly understand the security implications of using or running that software project.

okay hey everybody hope you're all

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,600
enjoying

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,919
cloud native security day so far my name

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960
is john kinsella i'm a chief architect

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
at acurix gonna talk about a project

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,880
i've been working on for a while

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
um this is a more of a proposal in a

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
talk form

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,279
bound around security nutrition labels

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,920
for cloud native

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
projects open source projects in general

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,439
so the idea here this originally came to

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
me

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
probably close to a year ago from an

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
academic paper

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,239
that was talking about nutrition labels

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
for privacy

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,680
i think we covered this at some point

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
application security weekly room co-host

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
i can't find a link to it so

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
unfortunately i don't have it in the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
notes

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,840
everything else i'm talking about is

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
referenced in we've got a page at the

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
back of the slide deck here which talk

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
which has all those links

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,840
but um so that's where this came from

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,199
uh and let's sort of dive in and talk

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
through so the point of this really is

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
is

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,280
i want to start a conversation here this

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
is being recorded a month before you

00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
guys see this so i'm still working on

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,079
this

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,920
i'm hoping to have a proposal into six

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
security

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
uh stuff you're gonna be seeing here is

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
on a github account so i'll probably be

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
pasting this in

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
um either while you guys are watching

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,560
this or during the q a at the end

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,560
um and and enjoying and

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
i'm i'll probably say many times but i'm

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,759
looking for feedback so

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
give us what you got so the

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,799
food and drug administration fda in the

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
united states

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,720
they consider this thing which i suspect

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600
all of us have seen

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
uh the nutrition facts label to be one

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
of the

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
uh most widely known graphics in the

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,799
world

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
uh you know we see it we sort of know

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,439
what's on there it's getting better

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
over time i'll talk a little bit about

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,240
the history but the idea is how do i

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,680
bring something like this

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,280
to security um and really in a

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
uh you know it's obviously not going to

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,159
be mandated by law so how do we do this

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
in a

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
uh a friendly way that allows people to

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,680
to have a sense of

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
what they're consuming and that that's

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,960
the core what's going on here

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,439
so the nutrition laws first came around

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
uh early 1900s i want to say in 1907

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,879
when fda

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
was formed again in the us this has now

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,520
grown you know there's

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,959
these type of rules are our labels are

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
all around the world in one form with

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
another

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
uh but really what's interesting is

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,040
their their uh creation came from

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,720
packaged goods packaged foods and

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,480
what happened is as people started

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
vendors started selling packaged goods

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,959
in in that manner you know there's

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
always going to be looking for someone

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
to make a few more cents

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
so start trying to figure out how do we

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
make that package either a little bit

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
smaller but look like it has the same

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
amount of stuff in it or maybe it's

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
cheaper ingredient

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
or maybe use more dangerous and great

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
ingredients so these are the type of

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
things people were doing

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
and you know people probably started

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
dying

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
or they weren't getting their money's

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
worth and the government said that ain't

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
that cool

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
so um a lot of started getting created

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
and

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
i don't know maybe there was some sort

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
of tom fuller in another company was

00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
saying hey

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
let's let's get the other guy so let's

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,239
get some laws i'm not sure the exact

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,599
creation but

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
i spent about a day digging into this

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
stuff and fox pulling down into it

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,159
and it's let's keep going um in the 70s

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
uh the first versions of the nutrition

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,080
labels were actually mandated

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,879
uh from a point of view of if you were

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
making health claims on the package

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,159
so when these are mandated around the

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
world it varies but you know

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,440
in the us's once you started saying hey

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,640
this makes your son

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
healthier or stronger or taller that's

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
the type of thing which people start

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
regulating

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
if you mention something like baby food

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
or what's in your baby food that's when

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,239
people get really nervous the mother's

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
out there probably listening to school

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,879
already sort of

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
that you know don't don't mess with my

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
little one and then since then every

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,360
decade or so

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,799
we've had some amount of tuning and

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
tweaking going on is this type of

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
document

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,920
uh and that's usually based off science

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,239
uh

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
you know as either our scientific

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
understanding of what we're consuming

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,280
gets better

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
or as the bad guys use science to figure

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,799
out a cheap way of getting something

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,840
extra goods

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,200
here we are so this is now going on over

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
to the digital side right

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
we've all heard about what apple's up to

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
i believe google's doing some of this

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,239
stuff as well

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,490
this is the a privacy label for

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,600
google photos

00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,280
[Music]

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
doing a lot of linking but you know this

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
is just being shown sort of that we went

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
from

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,919
food labels to digital labels from

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
privacy point of view so let's think

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,160
about what can we do with this for

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,919
security

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
um and obviously again you know we don't

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,000
have the

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
chokehold of a government we don't have

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
the chokehold of apple's

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,800
app store but what can we do in a way

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,000
which still allows our users to

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
have a little more trust in us

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
so from my own personal point of view i

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,919
thought about this from two aspects

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,320
uh one of those is when i'm first

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,680
looking at a project

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,199
what does it do right is is this if i

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
install this is it going to be taking

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
over my cluster or is it going to be

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,199
formatting my disk

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,880
or is it uploading data or

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,160
just generally what what's this thing

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,919
doing that i just downloaded i can't

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,520
code review everything

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,199
um if it's a big famous project that has

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,360
you know ten thousand stars on github

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,800
okay we've got a little more trust in it

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
um

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
probably as i think about that i'm

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
aiming at this more towards the sandbox

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,639
and the

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
um the middle step whose name i'm

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,520
forgetting uh in the the cncf process

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
those are the guys who

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,240
we're trying to figure out how do we get

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
them help so their project get more

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
adapt

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,600
adoption and then the second aspect is

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,600
installation help

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
this is a big one to me probably not so

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
much

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
um with an off-the-shelf thing you just

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
download and run like a brew install but

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
something that's a little more complex

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,800
like

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,560
i'm not going to name names but you

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
download the thing you compile it you

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
install it and then the configuration

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
starts and you

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
do one configuration you need to do

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
another configuration then you need to

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
create usernames you need to create

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
roles and the next it's at some point in

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
there you're so far in that you don't

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,039
want to back up and give up because

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,039
you've already committed this time to it

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
but you're like i wish i knew this

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,759
beginning before i got started i would

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
have gone and just bought something

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
right

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
so that's that's really what i'm looking

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,199
for here is

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,440
how can we help provide transparency in

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,319
these type of things

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
this is really not about uh you know the

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
whole

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,960
red green blue security bad don't use

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
type thing right

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,400
this is more uh advisory uh

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
not looking to admonish right we're open

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
source we're not trying to

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
spank people we're trying to get people

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
to do the right thing uh to increase

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,880
trust uh and i think what's an

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
interesting side effect of something

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
like this this is sort of a little bit

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
like a self-assessment

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
um and depending on where it goes this

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
might get linked into the

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
self-assessments i can see that as a

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,800
possibility

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
but i think as a application developer

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
or as a project

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,800
is realizing hey maybe i want to put a

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,400
security label or a badge on my

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
applic on my project on github

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,599
as they start going through and looking

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
at all those tick boxes that they could

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
be able to do or the ammo will show in a

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
few minutes

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
that might make them realize oh hey i

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,599
could do this really quickly and become

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,720
that little bit better on my badge

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,840
maybe they knew about it they just

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
hadn't got to it yet or maybe they

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,280
hadn't even thought about it

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
so i think from either aspect i think

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
there's some benefits there

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
to people doing that

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
and as fun as that is to talk about

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
those labels um

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,240
let's be honest here right if most of us

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
walk into a store in the morning

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479
say it's lunchtime and we're hungry

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,919
we're not going to be like this lady

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,360
here just going down the aisle picking

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,360
up every box and looking and reading

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
what's on the back of it

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,919
it's a lot more uh at least for me over

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,599
you know beside the last year covid

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,800
it's lunch time i go into store i grab

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,240
something i give somebody money and i

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
want to shove it in my face and go right

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
i'm not looking at detail

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
we will in some cases if we have a

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,560
dietary need

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
or we're buying something for a loved

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,199
one we're really careful about what

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,400
they're consuming

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,919
are some use cases like that but

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
what i'm trying to say is is you know

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,759
we're looking at the front of these

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,400
packages on the shelves

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
and that's where industry came up with

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
the system of

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
what they call a front of package label

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
and

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
you know let's let's get my ugly mug out

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
of the way here um

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
depending on the country or you know

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
obviously we have different languages on

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
here um

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
there's different ways different

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
organizations have gone about doing this

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
sometimes it's for

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,440
adult health sometimes it's for weight

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
watching sometimes it's you know

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,760
let's i think it's brazil that's

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,279
actually doing some of this for

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680
trying to minimize obesity in the

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,680
country

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
but one way or another we want to put a

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,720
simpler label on the front

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,080
that isn't this is 39 of your

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
recommended daily allowance it's like

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
hey

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
from a quick glance should i be eating

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
this should i be eating a lot of this

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,800
uh it's not this is poison don't touch

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
it it's more around

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
hey maybe you don't need five krispy

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
kremes right

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
so it's a little more guidance and this

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,720
is sort of

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
when you think about it this is a lot

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
like our badges we have on modern day

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
projects

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
on on on github right

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,640
so i don't have i haven't boiled down

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,399
what i'm looking at when i'm researching

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
into something quite this

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
beautifully simple that's what i'd love

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,600
to get to uh

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
you know most of those badges are pretty

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,320
small i'm not sure how much information

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,800
i could fit into them maybe it'll just

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
be a link out to somewhere else but

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,320
that'd be a nice goal to get to i think

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,640
for this um so

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
the graphic designers audience uh i'll

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,440
show my skills a little bit but i'm

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,640
still looking for help on that

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,920
uh so brainstorming what this actually

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
looks like or what we could put into

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
this

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,760
uh contents of label so in you know

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,279
the top few are pretty understandable uh

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
network connectivity

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
is this thing opening up a listener on

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,839
the network uh and you know actually

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,640
when you think about it

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,279
another use for a nutrition label like

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,360
this

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
it if someone's claiming that they're

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
not doing that and then suddenly an

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
application

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
is doing that

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
i don't want to say that's a sign of

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
tampering but that would sort of give

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,160
you

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,800
an extra an extra bit of information

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
during a

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
investigation so i think there's some

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
value there for that as i as we go

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,800
through this

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,640
um root privileges are they needed uh

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,480
you know do i need to run this is with a

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,079
um cluster admin role binding

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,440
the credential aspect is pretty

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
interesting we're seeing more and more

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
applications now that

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
uh they want an api key to go and

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,920
connect to github

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,920
atlantis comes to mind i've been working

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
on that recently or

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,959
um you know maybe it needs like

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,040
terraform once your

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,320
your credentials be able to go and spin

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,600
up uh

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
um vms on azure

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
or you know there's all sorts of

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
different use cases there around that

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,800
but that's something that

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,839
especially in enterprise world when

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,600
someone says oh i need i think for azure

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
in particular you can't just use a

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
read-only

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
account to look at your co your aks

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
clusters you need to have admin rights

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,360
to get the keys to get into them

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
a self-respecting uh enterprise with a

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
modern security policy isn't just going

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
to do that automatically so if they knew

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,839
something about that up front

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
as one example that that that's

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,880
something they want to understand what

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
they're getting into

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,480
uh we're all thinking about software

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
supply chain

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,760
so i threw a few points in around that

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
here uh and i think that's again you

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
know

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
transparency if we can help these people

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,600
do this or understand this

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,640
in that sort of you know checkbox type

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,640
format i think this will be handy um

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
and then the next group are a little

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,360
more advanced a little more mature

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
so i've we've got three examples here

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
coming up

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,720
one's a sandbox one's one of my own

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
applications or accuracy's applications

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
and then ones um a very mature

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
application so we'll see the difference

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,560
between those three how they show off in

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
something like this

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
do you have an architectural diagram

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,639
how about a threat model so these would

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
be more like just hate drafts right

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
if you've done a self-assessment

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
questionnaire if you are um working on

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
graduating from cncf

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
from the sandbox let's link out to that

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
so people can sort of see it very

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
quickly without a lot of this also is a

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
lot of this information is available

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,560
already

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,160
but how can we make this um sort of one

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
stop shop to get as much this type of

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,079
data so people can actually

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
you know i know if i go to the nutrition

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
label i can find

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
if they have a threat model i can find

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
it there and just go and review it and

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
keep going or i can look at their

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
self-assessment questionnaire from that

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
nice easy place

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,440
we're seeing more of the um the mature

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
projects starting to do third party

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
reviews

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,760
kubernetes has been doing it for a while

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
linker d we've got in here they've been

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
doing it

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,760
security contacts again you know this is

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,519
something that's fairly basic but

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,680
i'll point it myself not all projects

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
have it uh and then a security page do

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,639
you have sort of a single place where

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,200
people can go and find out more detail

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,160
about

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,600
the stuff we're talking about um i'll

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,959
try to not bob my head around i know

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,720
this camera's trying to follow me so i

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,399
hope that's not dragging people nuts

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,639
but keep going um

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,079
so three examples uh yaml

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,680
you know i figured we're always doing

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
the ammo already for most of stuff we're

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
doing around here

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
let's put this into a yama format as

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,639
well uh

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
and to sort of grab a pointer and go

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,079
through here

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,880
starts off fairly basic so this is for a

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760
cncf

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,120
sandbox sandbox project called

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
telepresence some of you may have heard

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
of it

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,519
long story short it allows sets up a

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,959
proxy between your desktop and a

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,240
kubernetes cluster so you can do remote

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,240
development you know so

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
application name source code url so

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
people can go and find that if they're

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,800
not there already

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,560
uh is it sending on the network is it

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
receiving on the network is it starting

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,440
a listener as i mentioned before

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,160
what port so this is where i'd love to

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
put as much as

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
i can into a a defined language but i

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,839
think for something like this there's

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,720
got to be a lot of just strings

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
right so a proxy is going to be

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
listening on whatever report that

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,120
somebody

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,720
needs it on another example down here

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
under privileges

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,440
what type of credentials are required in

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,600
a kubernetes cluster

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,079
this thing needs if this thing consumes

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,760
the the privileges of the person running

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
that application from their desktop

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,639
there's a minimum set of requirements

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
but that's what they're consuming

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,760
what the application's consuming doesn't

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
need roots doesn't need privileges so

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,720
you know looking pretty good here so far

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
um some of their commits are signed not

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,760
quite all of them

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,320
and then same with builds so i think

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,920
andy builds nowadays that goes on to

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,360
homebrew has to be signed

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,839
and we're seeing more and more of that

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
type of thing

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
excuse me the interesting one here on

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
the git commits and i'm not sure i

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,920
haven't been watching what the the

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,120
um software supply chain guys have been

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,040
doing in detail but

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
from a point of view of very few

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,399
projects have been signing their commit

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,279
since day one

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,959
so do we say hey the last three releases

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
have had their all their commits signed

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
maybe

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,959
all their commits in the last six months

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,079
have been signed is it the last hundred

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
commits have been signed

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,760
what type of verbiage could pui put in

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
their language could we put in there

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,360
that that makes that

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,399
meaningful but not a very black and

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,079
white yes no that

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
most companies or most projects couldn't

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,320
actually respond to

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
let's move forward to example number two

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
this is for terascan this is an acure x

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,440
application open source

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
uh and really it's an isc application

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,360
that can scan kubernetes and

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,759
customize and helm and um terraform

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,279
uh but again so sort of going through

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199
here

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,199
he's able to you know get the url for

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,720
source um he's

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,560
listens he excuse me he sends on the

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
network by default he down you know he

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
sends out a request to get to a github's

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
dual poll

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,040
uh for his rules uh listening is

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,120
optional so it can run as a server

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
or by the time this is published as an

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,720
admission controller

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
but by default it doesn't so listing

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
that's optional i think that's

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,759
okay to do listens on a particular

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,279
report

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,000
unless that's overridden most arrests is

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
pretty clean

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,279
again recent git commits have been

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
signed i've been pushing for that

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
uh our builds are signed and we actually

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,079
have an architecture diagram so we're

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
able to get you know one point there on

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,639
the

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
advanced things i don't have a contact

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
for security it's something we need to

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
do and

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
hopefully by the time this is published

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
um

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
so moving towards something a little

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
more advanced still advanced

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,320
still here so this is linker d graduated

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,519
project

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,279
um and again it starts off sort of the

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
same you know send and receive and these

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
type of things

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
he's doing tls by default uh they're

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,440
they're really trying to do security but

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
secure by default so they're

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
um they're able to check boxes like this

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
a lot easier so that's going to look

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
better in a diagram right in a

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,520
nutrition label again it's a proxy type

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,400
application so the ports listing on it

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
varies

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
uh it does need cluster rules uh you

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,360
know you

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,720
i think you can run linker d and maybe

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,400
just a single

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,600
um name space i think so you

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,360
might not have to have a complete

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,319
cluster role binding but really if you

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,959
want to do anything useful with it i

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,079
think that's the way you're going to go

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,559
again sign git commits assigned to

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,600
builds

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
and then as we come down into the

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,679
maturity stuff you're seeing more stuff

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
down here so

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,960
they've got a security page they've got

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
their third-party audit they've got

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,400
their architecture diagram they've got

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
their security contact

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
so you know we're filling up more on my

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
screen here uh there's more stuff that

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,039
we could put into these

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
uh slides so that i haven't dreamed up

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,200
yet some of them i'm trying to

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
keep you know this readable so bear with

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
me

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
but that's sort of an example of looking

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,280
at three different three different

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,480
applications how would they

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,360
how would they be um how do you

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
communicate

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,320
in a a yaml form what their

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,080
security facts their nutrition facts are

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
so that's sort of

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,160
thoughts on that so then you know let's

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,760
go from this into a graphic format what

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,440
would that look like

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
if we came back to our initial slide so

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,480
this is something i mocked up from

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,559
linker d um you know it's

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
it's easy it's simple it's not too much

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,080
for me to talk to here right

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,600
it's when you take that and sort of

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,679
break it down into a

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039
consumable visually consumable format

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,200
it's it's

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,520
um i sort of like this i have to say so

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
uh a few check boxes that they're doing

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
industry standards

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
maybe not everything i'm not sure if i'd

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,039
call variable ports industry standard so

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
i left that off

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,679
same for the cluster role binding

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
but a brief description what they're

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
talking about name their project and

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,039
then you know

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
the all-important who do we contact if

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,400
there's a problem

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
and maybe there's a few more things i

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
should put in here i'm not sure about

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
putting in links for the security pages

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
i guess it could be or maybe just a link

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,720
rendering html so

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
um we'll see what we do around that so

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
um

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,080
this is what i've been working with this

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,679
is the idea i've been playing with i'm

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
looking for any feedback anybody want to

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,919
work

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
work with me on this as i mentioned i'm

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,480
hoping to have this in as a

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,679
proposal into six security um and we'll

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,760
see where it goes from there

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,039
uh but i appreciate your time i think

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
we've got about 10 minutes left for

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,559
questions

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
um can feel free to reach out to me on

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,640
cncf cncfsjlk

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
or on twitter at your handle there john

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
