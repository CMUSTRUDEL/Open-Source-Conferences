	Designing Secure Applications in the Cloud - Adora Nwodo, Microsoft

When building cloud applications, we should always bear in mind that our services are exposed on the Internet and can be accessed by anyone and may have untrusted users.  Because of this, we need to be proactive and aware of these possible security threats so that we can design our cloud applications to be able to handle them properly. Apart from preventing malicious attacks, cloud applications must also be designed to protect sensitive data and grant access for certain resources to only authorized users.  In this session, I will be talking about 3 security patterns that can be used to prevent malicious or accidental actions outside of the applications designed usage, and to prevent disclosure or loss of information when building for the cloud.
