good morning everyone and welcome to the

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,600
cloud native computing foundation's

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
cloud native security day

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
i'm emily fox co-chair of sig security

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
and we'll be kicking off this event

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
thank you for joining me in our awesome

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,719
collection of presenters

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,160
we appreciate everyone's flexibility

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,920
this year that enabled us to adjust the

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,520
way in which this event is held

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
i would like to extend a huge thank you

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
to cncf for allowing the special

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
interest group for security to hold this

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
event a third time

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
as well as working with us the security

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
day program committee to make the

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
transition to a virtual event possible

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
the point of today is to bring together

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
several diverse communities

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
security development and operations this

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,840
event is designed to enable

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,200
collaboration and sharing that pushes

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960
the security of all cloud native

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
applications and platforms forward

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
this day is for you our community and

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,719
the cloud native tools and capabilities

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,920
you work on and use that allow

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,440
applications and products to be

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
available to the end user

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
in a well understood secure fashion

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
throughout today we want to encourage

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
you to share in the slack channel or

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
through social media and help

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
move the security of cloud native

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,080
forward

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,720
so what is sig security what are we and

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
what do we do

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
the cncf special interest group was

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,240
formed from safe

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,080
a small group of like-minded security

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
focused individuals intent on reducing

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
the gap between technology

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
adoption and when security is applied

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,720
they also sought a more common knowledge

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,640
of security

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
often seen as an alien language to the

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,880
development and operations communities

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,799
sig security is here to assist in

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
reducing data exposure of cloud-native

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,680
applications

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,880
as well as unauthorized access to and by

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,479
those applications

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,400
we focus on protecting cloud-native

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,000
systems we enable the community to

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,680
engage in a common language of knowledge

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
and tooling so developers and teams

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,119
comprehend the implications of security

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
and risk within their code

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
their applications their deployments and

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,759
their architectures

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,600
we seek common tooling for the core

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,040
foundations of security allowing all

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
cloud native applications to be

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
transparent of security events so the

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,439
community and its operators can take

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
more impactful

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,960
direct swift action before the next

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,960
exploit and data exposure occurs

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
our community is growing strong with

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
over 68 members contributing weekly to

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,119
our various presentations

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
projects and documentation not all of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,400
our members are security experts but

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
each contribute to the sig through their

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
background skills and experiences that

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,959
help make the sig

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,280
a robust diverse and welcoming community

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,920
it's not just all discussions however

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
sig security does many things

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
during our weekly meetings we have

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
presentations on numerous topics

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,519
everything from upcoming cnc of sandbox

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,280
projects to requests for help by the

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
community to move security forward

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
in october we had a presentation from

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
the confidential computing consortium

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
and the cloud security alliance on

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,760
serverless security

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
as you can see we have involvement from

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
many different areas of open source

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,280
we also perform security assessments

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
that assist the community and its

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,319
projects with an initial understanding

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
of the state of their security

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
help inform the cncf technical oversight

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
committee of the security aspects of

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
cloud native projects

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
and provide cloud native projects with

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
an initial starting point for the

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,800
security documentation

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,800
as of october we've helped completed

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
five security assessments and in a true

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,599
agile fashion

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,200
reviewing what worked and didn't work in

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
hopes of providing an even better

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
process and experience for projects

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,800
as well as more concrete security impact

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
to those projects into the technical

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,640
oversight committee

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
as part of the in toto assessment we now

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
host a community-driven catalog of

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,840
supply chain compromises

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
which provide real-world examples that

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
help raise awareness and provide

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
detailed information that lets us

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
understand attack factors

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
and consider how to mitigate potential

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,280
risk in the supply chain

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,560
we are currently wrapping up a major

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
effort for the community called the

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,319
cloud native security white paper

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,680
which is written to give the audience a

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,040
guide to their first cloud native

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
security architecture

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
this is a huge undertaking by the

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
community and while extremely

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,879
comprehensive

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,200
we fully expect to continue iterating

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,120
and improving it after it's released

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
today's event was started last year as a

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
community driven project

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
and has grown to be an event at kubecon

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,319
and cloud native con north america

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
and europe as well as for the first time

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,439
this year featuring an all

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,519
virtual ctf and wrap up check the events

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,200
cloud native security day ctf slack

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,959
channel for more information

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,640
you see the passion of the community is

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,920
what moves us forward and our community

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,079
driven projects are the emphasis of this

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,519
traditionally we hold in-person events

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
co-located with kubecon and

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
cloudnativecon

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
however given everything going on we

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
want to ensure our community is safe

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
looking forward we hope to continue our

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
in-person meetups as valuable avenues to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
team

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,680
network and continue moving security

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
forward for cloud native
