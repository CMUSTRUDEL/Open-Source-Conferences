for sig security so we're gonna

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
talk a little bit more about security

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,719
and how you can get involved with this

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
awesome group of people

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039

open everything up for

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,520
q a in case you're curious about

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,600
anything else going on with sig security

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
or if you've got questions about

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
anything associated with cloud native

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
security we've got some great stuff

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,800

thank you emily awesome so

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,360
i'm just going to go through a couple of

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
slides so i'm going to tell you a little

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
bit more about

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,280
security um on top of what emily has

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,520
already shared this morning

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
and then we're going to go into the

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
discussions

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
so awesome what do we have for sec

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
security

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
um so emily covered in the morning a

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
little bit about presentations and

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
discussions

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,159
uh this is something that's ongoing as

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
you can see some of the

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
the topics here uh of our stuff that

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
we've seen today

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,560
for example parsec there's some

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
there's a lot of topics that we have

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
coming from

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
um the other working groups that we work

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
with for example

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
the um policy working group

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,840
we work closely with other this big data

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,719
working group and so on

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
and as emily mentioned you know whenever

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
there's

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,920
a chance for community collaboration uh

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
for example ava dropped by

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
from the confidential competing

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
consortium and then we talked about you

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,640
know the ways we could engage

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,000
as a cognitive community um so if you're

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,160
in um a community that would like to be

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
uh involved with cloud native security

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
on there

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,319
is you are you have a project that you

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
think

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,040
um would be interesting to share about

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,760
um to come create an issue uh everything

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
that we have

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
is managerial github

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
so another big thing that we have is the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
supply chain catalog

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
this was something that was created a

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,519
while back by

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,760
by santiago and a couple others

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,599
and there was a lot of interest in the

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
supply chain

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,080
problems in security today we even had a

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,400
breakout

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
hallway track session on that and i

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
think there were a lot of

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
interesting things that were put in

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
there i think there was even a paper it

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,720
was called

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
the backstabbers knives collection or

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
something also paper is definitely

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,440
something to read

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,120
uh it's a cool title so um this catalog

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,959
is commonly maintained so um

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
i think based on the the number of

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
resources that were posted in the

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,800
channel

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
uh if you see that there's something

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
they're missing that's missing for the

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
catalog

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
or we can make improvements to it please

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,560
don't hesitate to

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
create a pr against it

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
all right so um usually we have

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,720
ampersand meetups

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,319
so um this is something that hopefully

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,440
next year we'll start resuming

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,640
once um things get back to normal

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,040
um so hopefully um

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,799
i know europe will be virtual but maybe

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
the next q con and they

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
will see each other again

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,239
and um we also have security assessments

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,400
this was is one of the car activities

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,200
that we engaged in

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
today we have um five security

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
assessments

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,720
already done um these security

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,120
assessments are way to really assess the

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,519
security posture of a cncf project

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,199
there's a lot of interaction to the tlc

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,639
and helping them

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,000
provide recommendations on what is

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,320
a project's security posture as

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
well as as a secure if it's security

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,360
project for example

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,479
how does it really fit into the cncf

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,880
ecosystem and

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
the the output of this project is a

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
security document

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
which um you know we for these projects

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,080
that we've already done

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,360
um it is a document where if you're

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,440
interested in the project

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
or you have been looking at one of these

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
projects for example oprah

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
and you're not sure like where do you

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
where do i start in terms of security

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
considerations

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,400
um the security assessment document is

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
something that you should definitely

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,240
take a look at

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
it really is like a good introductory

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,840
document

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,240
security assessments are also a good

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,600
way to engage in the community uh

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,520
usually assessments

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
are scoped about two about four weeks

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,400
total

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,240
uh where two weeks of it is the main

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
review and assessment and the rest

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,919
is kind of putting together everything

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
at the end

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,120
and then looking up

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
a summary of what the recommendations

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
are

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,199
so it's very nicely scoped usually we

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,600
have 405 reviews

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,479
assessment and so this is open to

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
to everyone if you're someone that is

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,479
new to this

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,199
or would like to learn

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
we have opportunities to kind of shadow

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,479
to kind of

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
join the channel to see what's happening

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
with the security assessments

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
and if you're someone that's experienced

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,000
with this um

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,440
definitely come take a look and it'll be

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
great to have more people on board

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,240
so just a shout out to all the security

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,600
reviewers we've had since

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,440
we started security assessments uh thank

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
you so much we wouldn't have been able

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,000
to do

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
the the first vice assessments which was

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
our

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
first security assessment milestone

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,400
so how do i get involved with sec

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,319
security

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,440
um six security is um mainly

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
based on our github repository so if you

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,319
go there

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
um there's meeting information stack

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
information

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,199
uh everything is governed in the github

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
repository

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
and so

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
there is a new members page that you can

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
take a look at uh tells you a little bit

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
more about

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,319
security what we do as well as how to

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,199
add yourself as a member to

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,479
the group we have weekly meetings that

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,919
you can join in our

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,639
zoom session every wednesday

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
if not what happens usually in the repo

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
is

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,479
everything is well documented in issues

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
of pull requests so if you actually go

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,560
to a

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,039
the github repo and you go into issues

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
uh if you've seen anything in the

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
previous slides that you're interested

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
in for example

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
you wanna present something about your

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,720
project to the group

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,800
or talk about you know the security

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,840
uh practices within your organization

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
you can

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,360
uh you can create an issue for

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,039
presentation and then

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,039
you know we'll start out the logistics

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
to do that you present that

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,440
or if you have a security idea that

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,960
you would like to you think could the

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
guru could benefit from you could add a

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,639
proposal or a suggestion

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
and if you're a project that would like

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
to

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,879
start a security assessment process you

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,520
can go ahead and create a security

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
assessment

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
issue

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
so with that i'm gonna wrap up this this

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,599
part of the closing

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
um like i mentioned multiple times

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,240
before

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,759
everything is on the github so if if

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
um if you remember one thing um just go

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
to the github

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,240
um cncf security

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
uh our meeting times are on wednesday

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,919
and we have a sac

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
link over here of which is part of the

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,080
cncf site

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,839
and don't forget to sign up for our

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
mailing list

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
all right so emily back to you

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,320
that was awesome thank you so much

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
brandon um

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
jj what was one of your favorite talks

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
for today i know i have a list

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,440
and i know brandon's got at least one if

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
not too

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,839
um but jj how about you what was your

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,839
favorite talk

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
oh jj i can't hear you

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
sorry i'll first go to lantern before i

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,160
actually

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,160
go for it i'll i'll have to digest my

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah i i think i think for me um

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,160
i think i had i had a couple of favorite

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,800
talks um

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,519
i really like the you know the dynamic

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
analysis

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
during the ashtrays system calls you're

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
talking about

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,080
ebpf and how it's kind of really evolved

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,399
how people do analysis and dynamic

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
um even just like the runtime security

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,800
stuff

00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,880
um i'm also like a big fan of any

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,959
hardware security um related things so

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,480
here the past like presentations and

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,079
also even

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,680
uh even the certificates um i think

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,680
we're talking about how we actually

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
bootstrap the chain of trust to hsm i

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
think i thought that was cool

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
yeah definitely those ones were all

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
really good ones

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,079
um i i think so i

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
it's hard for me to like just pick one

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,560
but i i have to admit

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,079
the ubc talk at the end of the day right

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
before the ctf wrap up

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
i thought was really cool because it

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,760
highlighted

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,040
a huge problem space that occurs in the

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
community when we're

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
trying to go cloud native because cloud

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,920
native landscape is so large

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
and security is like three miles long

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,760
and like

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,920
leagues deep but the

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,600
the nice little shopping list that they

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
put together for how to get

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
um some of these tool tools to work

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,959
together

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
and we we heard about that earlier in

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,519
some of the other talks that you can't

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,399
just like

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,839
pick one solution and just roll with it

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,920
and you're automatically secure

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
you have to work on them a little bit

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,839
you have to build that defense and depth

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,800
mentality across your organization this

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,440
is not just going to be

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
runtime security that's a concern it's

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,320
going to be

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
all along your supply chain it's going

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,279
to be through your build it's going to

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:28,320
be through your pipeline

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:31,440
all of that jj what about you

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
i mean the eppf stock was like the most

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,200
fascinating one

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,600
uh i'd love to uh

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
there's so much so much about the abpf

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,519
that's actually a mystery

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
for most people in terms of is it secure

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,440
is it not secure is it kernel board is

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,770
it not kernel mode

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,880
and

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,880
[Music]

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,519
and i mean as an industry i think

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,880
there's a lot of clarification

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,760
it's super powerful as a tool to be used

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,120
and super relevant for the modern day

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,839
compute and a modern day

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
networking overall and especially modern

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,839
day observability

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,760
that actually provides much more

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,880
security at scale

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
so i hope uh

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
i hope there is more of those kinds of

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,440
discussions and talks that

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,279
uh that happen to ease and comfort

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
users there is also like a lot of doubts

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,120
in terms of the versions of

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
kernel where it's applicable too so

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,240
there is there is tremendous amount of

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,800
repetition in terms of like adopting

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,079
ebpf and i think more of those stocks

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,800
will actually help these

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,079
and i think it is much more relevant for

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,920
security at scale

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:51,760
for a lot of things so that was my

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,880
most favorite talk

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,839
yeah and i think i think also um

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,560
jj talked about you know the modern

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,120
modern cloud

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
deployments and also emily talked about

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
you know just having to juggle

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
uh different aspects of security but

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,839
then

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,639
you know even like in the the chat

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
governance

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
um lightning talk where we talked about

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
you know it's not even just

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
different components of your security

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
ecosystem but

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,880
when you have multiple parties involved

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,079
like your cloud provider

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,519
um you know how do you make sure that

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,040
you have proper governance

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,399
of that you know what um

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,160
as a as a

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,160
company or as a cloud user

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
how do i ensure that even my

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
implementation security

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
meets up to the standards how do i do

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,040
compliance and or disability

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
if i don't own certain services

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,199
yeah policy distribution at

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,160
scale computed with

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,199
performance is it's going to be a

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,440
challenge and the more the computes are

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,720
not under your control the more faster

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
you want to

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,839
like evaluate the security policies

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
and it needs to happen closer to the

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,279
edge

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
so it's going to be a that is something

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,240
that actually

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,800
was it's still fascinating and i think

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
it should

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
we should pay attention to that i

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
suppose i mean overall all the talks

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,079
were

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,440
phenomenal and fantastic especially some

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,839
that actually overlaid the industry

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:45,839
was also good but this one was

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,839
probably my favorite talk

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,920
so uh we actually got our first question

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
uh one of our sig security members

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,399
decided to ask it

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,480
so um bushkara wants to know what are

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,480
our recommendations for security related

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
talks to attend for the rest of kubecon

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
and i can only assume that he's asking

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199
that because

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,120
he's so in love with all the security

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,320
talks that we had today at cloud native

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
security day

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
and he can't quite get enough of it as

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
we've seen in some of the other slack

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,519
channels talking about security day so

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
brandon what

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
what talk are you looking forward to or

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,320
would you recommend

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,600
in the kubecon schedule i'll be honest i

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
was going to look through this tonight

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,959
i actually haven't had the time to

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,199
lecture doctor does this

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,680
um i'm magic i'm looking through it

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
right now

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,639
um

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,120
all right jj how about you yeah give me

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,120
a second

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
yeah i haven't uh i'm in the same camp

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,839
as uh

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
brandon um

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,519
i think yeah i'm just looking

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
through it quickly i think there are a

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,320
few few things

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:10,399
that could be interesting um

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,560
anything which is kind of like bypassing

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,120
security mechanisms i think you know

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:21,040
the one that um that the google team did

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,800
a couple coupons back on like um

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
jumping between notes that one was cool

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,920
so there's a there's another one

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,360
called um bypass falco so i think this

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,800
could be cool you know it's going to

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
touch on

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,120
um a lot of the the the stuff that we

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,839
just talked about like ebpf

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
you know it's it's a mystery it's um

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,959
it's something cool but

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
i think this would be kind of a good

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,480
insight and a nice exercise to kind of

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,480
see

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,920
how um how the trap model of that fits

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,279
into

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,279
into applications as well

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
yeah for me like i spent most of

00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,759
yesterday

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,399
furiously combing through the schedule

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,439
looking at all of the talks

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,640
the bypassing falco one definitely stood

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,720
out for sure

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
uh there were a couple of other ones

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,079
though that i thought were really

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:17,600
interesting uh let me find that one

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,480
uh there's i mean pretty much any talk

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,799
with liz

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,280
and it liz rice is going to be good uh

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,319
man there's just so many and that's what

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
one of the nice things is

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,360
that we're starting to see more security

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
focused talks with um

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
or even just regular technical talks

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
with the security bend to them which is

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,600
fabulous and that's something that we

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,160
want to see from the community

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,039
but yeah i actually have my schedule

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,000
viewable so if you are

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
friends with me in sketch you can check

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
out and see

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,679
which sessions i'm going to if you're

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,320
interested

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
uh look yeah i think i think to stop the

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,799
starbucks one

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
stop about something that i looked at

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,600
for for a bit

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,880
it's definitely a cool observability as

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,679
well as kind of get a good idea of what

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
you know things within your cluster

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,480
what's happening there

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,600
i also i'm looking forward to

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,080
the pki pki the wrong way

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,280
um because that is something that aldo

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,360
has been around

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,160
um is misunderstood a lot and i think

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,280
this is gonna be um

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,320
you know help solidify some of

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,679
the kind of mindsets and also hopefully

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,440
give me another way to

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,080
to see it and to see how

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,919
how we can you know make sure we cover

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,400
those grounds when we're in the

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
bki i feel like no matter how many times

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,240
you do it

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
you get bound to make mistakes

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,640
yeah we got another question um for

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,360
compliance automation do we have any

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,280
recommendations for a specific session

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,039
um i i would like to point out that we

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,760
had some excellent compliance

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
check coverage today with oppa i think

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,360
there was at least

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
three talks discussed today that

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,600
mentioned opa

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,720
or talked about policy enforcement

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,080
and automation of policy roles

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,960
so jj do you know of a particular talk

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,400
or maybe even specific technology that

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,520
we can point books to

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,520
to learn more in that space

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,440
um i mean oppas uh hope

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
is a pretty good

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,960
pretty good first step and i think there

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,919
is also

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,760
a bunch around

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,919
that's published closer to cloud

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
security alliance that actually is

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
somewhat of the intersection point of

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
where we are

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,640
if you're looking purely for compliance

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,960
i think there are a bunch of

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
standard space stuff that that are

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
available

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,720
that it's probably worth looking at

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,640
but we do a lot of cross-pollination

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,360
between like a bunch of other

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,120
security consortiums to ours and i think

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,400
if you were to

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,360
listen to some of the security

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,880
talks like in the last previous four to

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
five blocks i think a bunch of times

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
compliance

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,799
has come up in the conversation and

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
there were like few good recommendations

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,159
there too but in general

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,080
uh there's good amount of resources in

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
cloud security alliances that i'll point

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,559
to

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,600
uh overall and then attending

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,679
six security meeting for more of uh

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
more of in-depth conversation would be

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,919
an useful thing

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
and compliance is like one of those

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
things where like when your

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
infrastructure is moving dynamically

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
anything that's been defined yesterday

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,200
doesn't actually apply today

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,559
uh and it's uh

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,000
it's uh it's good to have

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,240
a scriptable compliance story to go with

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,760
uh but what you want to know is like

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
what uh

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
how do you verify validate and then how

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
do you basically assert

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,039
what you have sets what's happening uh

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,120
in the system

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,880
uh when the infrastructure itself is

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,320
changing when

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
computes are not the thing that you

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,440
actually own

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,640
this uh it's a to a large extent it's an

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
open problem so

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
participating in community is probably

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,039
what i would say

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,190
to keep uh ahead of what your compliance

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
story should look like

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,520
[Music]

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,080
yeah i think uh there are like two

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
two or more over talks um in the

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,320
security track

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,520
um but but while we're on this

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,159
i think a couple other sessions that our

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,039
topics

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840
you know outside kubecon um you know

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,280
oscar

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,960
is one of them um

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,600
and also just um my personal

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,039
way to kind of like look into the

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
compliance one of the things that i like

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,039
doing

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,960
is a lot of these um

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,400
you know products have kind of like this

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,280
compliance mapping

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,360
where they'll kind of say okay here's um

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,159
here's a new standard here's

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,840
where the specific controls we'll map

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
onto it

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,200
we did some work as part of the sick

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,000
with the

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,360
um the dod there was a spreadsheet

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
somewhere

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
i i think we can make it in the the

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,840
slack channel later

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,000
but that kind of talked about what some

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,120
of the controls that you know kubernetes

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,400
or you know some kind of scanning tools

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,679
are going to be

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,200
um but i think yeah compliance is

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,200
something that's

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,280
very specific to implementation as well

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,320
as very specific to

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
the type of compliance that that you

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,280
want to

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
end up doing whether it's you know um

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,480
fisma

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,480
or or fedramp or hipaa but you should

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
buy something this so so if you can map

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,919
it

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,080
on some some type of in this 853 you

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,520
should be fine

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
yeah you actually brought up a good

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,000
point and this is something that we back

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,840
we've talked about

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,600
quite a bit in the sig is that security

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,200
and compliance are often lumped together

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,919
and they don't always mean the same

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,960
thing

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,760
you can be more secure in some cases

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,440
through implementing compliance controls

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
but you're not always going to be

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,720
compliant when you're just implementing

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,960
security out of the gate

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,039
so it's important to note that

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,960
compliance rule sets and policy rule

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,400
sets can help make your organization

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
more secure when you're doing them

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,120
correctly

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,480
but one does not always necessarily mean

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
the other

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
and we we've talked about this in a

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
couple of previous meetings within the

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,200
sig

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,440
and it's actually going to be discussed

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
briefly and the cloud native security

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
weight paper which is going to go

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,720
live tomorrow so shout out to cncf the

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,880
awesome folks there that have helped us

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,559
work through the logistics about getting

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,480
that document published

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,480
and it will become live in our repo

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,840
after kubecon cloudnativecon

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,840
is complete

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,200
that you

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
the white paper also has a lot of a lot

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,240
of pointers too

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,159
it doesn't have a full story on

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,520
compliance but it has different amount

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
of indications to what

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,919
think through in terms of compliance so

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,880
i'd highly recommend

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,960
uh taking a look at uh look at that as

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,320
well

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
yeah i think also um the policy what

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,559
group

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,799
that is friendly and csv um

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
has some discussions i i looked at a

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
couple recordings

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,320
for some of the sessions and they're

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,080
talking about compliance and in terms of

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
the policy framework as well so that

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
could be a good place to

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
to go through as well

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,360
definitely for sure um

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,360
what else did you guys like the most

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
about security day

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,039
overall mostly because i've been so

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,559
close to the cloud native security white

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,960
paper and getting that wrapped up

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,039
it was really nice to see that almost

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,520
every single one of the talks

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,360
were entirely about cloud native

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,080
security end to end

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
or at least how you manage or deal with

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,400
a particular problem area

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
in cloud native security it's i talked

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,320
specifically about

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,480
dynamic image security scanning and how

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,720
that fits into your life cycle which we

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,120
talk about in the paper as well

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,200
um alfie and nick talking about the

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,880
importance of your data source and the

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
benefits of understanding

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,799
what the data gives you for cloud native

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
security kelly talked about security

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,880
theater which i think a lot of us

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
are very familiar with and the list just

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
goes on and on

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
a lot of these topics are huge problems

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
in the

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,000
area where we're trying to move security

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,520
forward and there was a lot of that kind

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,559
of like progression

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,400
um in many of the talks what did what

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
did you all think about

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
the what was the most important theme or

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,760
what were the biggest takeaways from

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
today

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,320
for me actually i i feel like um

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,480
the the cool thing was that we kind of

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
see

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,279
the talks evolving to

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,640
be targeted towards a more mutual

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
security posture

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
of running compute you know it's no

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,880
longer

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,559
um oh i'm just going to put some

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,440
scanning stuff

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,440
and then i have the ci and have my

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,080
cluster and our bank and i find right

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
we're going to be

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,600
seeing a lot of more advanced

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,880
problems right that's why we have um

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,880
cartographer

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,720
um you know we're looking at service

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,760
mesh we look at you know how do i

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
having service mesh site cars and and

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
authorization

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,400
kafka right how do i bring it all

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,559
together in a place that makes sense

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,159
uh we're not just talking about simple

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,440
basic controls but you know how do we

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,400
tie the entire security

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
picture together so i think that that's

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
what

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,039
i i got excited about especially about

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,080
the hardware stuff

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,200
um but i you know i'm curious to hear

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,919
from everyone as well you know what uh

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
kind of future topics that we can really

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,399
go into

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,320
what's interesting what are the new

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,760
requirements that we're seeing

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,799
uh as we are getting more and more

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,960
workloads moving to accommodative

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,840
yeah i mean one of the talk related to

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,679
that

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,080
that reminded me of is the uh

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,720
defenders thinking list attackers think

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,760
and grab

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,200
that one was a yeah

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,919
yeah there are like multiple people that

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,039
talked about that as well uh

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,039
before this isn't the first time but

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,360
uh it's just fascinating for

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,320
as as the services get more distributed

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,200
as the services are running everywhere

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
the difference mechanism of early days

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
of like just making it

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,640
perimeter-based security doesn't

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,840
actually really work

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,360
now we have to look through

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,960
the defense mechanism in a completely

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,720
different way to

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,159
think through it that i would highly

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,590
recommend like any talk any

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,360
directionally

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,640
[Music]

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,640
applications either compliance

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,880
verifications or even application of

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,880
authorization policies that thinks about

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,039
it in a graph based way

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,159
it's probably a directionally right

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,120
thing to do

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,480
might be too early to be honest i think

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,159
it's still

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,000
still a lot to be decided in terms of

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
performance when you're evaluating in

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
that zone but

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
directionally i think that's probably a

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,200
good

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,200
good way to think through security

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
yeah i think uh one of the interesting

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,679
things that we got

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,640
a lot of is you're just because you're

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,480
doing containers

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,440
doesn't necessarily mean you're secure

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,559
um and we saw that through this etf and

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,600
it's unfortunate that

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,760
andrew handed trump offline uh but

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,440
if you were online before he did a

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,840
wrap-up of the ctf

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,279
and he went through all of the all the

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,279
challenges and the flags

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,279
and this was our first time doing this

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,360
etf as part of cloud native security day

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,080
we wanted to do one of these for a while

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,600
and it's really awesome to see so many

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,600
people especially first

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,440
and security or folks just sipping their

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,960
toes into the water

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,039
to be so successful in their first

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,559
container escape

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,159
did either of you have a chance to

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:42,399
participate in the ccf i know i didn't

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,440
i didn't no i didn't get to

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,120
unfortunately maybe next year when

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,559
when we can take a break from running

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,720
the event well next week

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,039
we should we should uh get andrew to

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,960
give us all the access

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,960
that's right but exactly right

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,200
but yeah the container security is super

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,480
important but container security isn't

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,120
the only thing that's going

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,960
on in the cloud native space we had a

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
presentation at one of the cigs recently

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
about serverless security from the cloud

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
native security alliance

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,080
and as of late i mean i've been getting

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,520
a lot of newsletters from various

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,720
sources about things that are going on

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,880
in the security landscape

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,320
and serverless security has pretty much

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,279
come up in the last 10

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,640
emails about it that i've gotten so i'm

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
i'm curious do you guys think we're

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,880
going to get some serverless security

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
talks next year maybe

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,279
that could be cool yeah yeah it is

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,520
it is a fascinating topic so what

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,080
security because it is the ephemerality

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,520
of

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,039
makes it uh harder to

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,640
enforce a security that's actually

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,880
consistent so

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
yeah i think it's harder but at the same

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,880
time it's easier because

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
the good thing is really it's it's

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,360
decompose your entire

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,200
application your entire enterprise into

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,480
the smallest component so you could

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,360
technically

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,840
uh theoretically have the best

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,840
authorization policies ever

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,360
which is um that level attraction

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,640
of compute and multi-tenancy

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,360
it's the difference between container

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,559
contained will be more secure container

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,960
is assumed security right so

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,960
that's the

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,320
yeah the the nice thing about that and

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,360
with a lot of the other talks that we

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,080
got especially from the

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,559
the end user stories like with ubico and

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
um

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,880
one of the other presentations that we

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,880
had earlier is that it kind of builds on

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,399
the previous layer or the previous

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
activities or the previous part of the

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,559
life cycle

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
to ensure that we're getting to that

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,039
more and more secure state as compute

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,919
gets more and more finite and smaller

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,360
so i'm i'm curious to see what kind of

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,000
talk submissions we're going to get next

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,840
year i'm very excited about it

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
do we have any other questions from

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
folks i know that we

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,880
we had a bunch of people drop off at one

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,320
point we had like 60 plus people

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,840
in the viewing area yeah i think we are

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,880
over time a little bit i'm not sure

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,679
we're never gonna get kicked off all

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,600
right well

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,440
i will go ahead and wrap things up i

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,279
want to thank everybody for joining us

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,519
for cloud native security day north

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,159
america 2020 thank you brandon thank you

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,519
jj thank you all of the cncf staff that

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,679
helped make this possible

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,880
as well as the cloud native security day

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,880
program committee without

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
all of you here attending the event and

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,799
volunteering and helping out

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
we could not make this possible so thank

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,039
you all so much

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,399
i hope you had a wonderful day yeah i

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,960
have to say big

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:48,960
big kudos to um the ctft and this is the

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,720
one of the smoother cdfs i've seen run

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
i want to give a big shout out to emily
