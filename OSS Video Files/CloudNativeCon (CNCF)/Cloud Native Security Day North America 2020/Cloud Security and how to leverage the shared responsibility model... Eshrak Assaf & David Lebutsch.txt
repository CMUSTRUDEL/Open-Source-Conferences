Description: 
	Cloud Security and how to leverage the shared responsibility model to your advantage - Eshrak Assaf & David Lebutsch, IBM

Adopting Cloud Computing models could be a blessing or a curse. When done with security and compliance in mind, it could save you lots of time, effort and operational costs. When done without regard to security and compliance, it could result in exposing your company to financial and reputational risks. In this session, we will talk about some basic security and compliance concepts that developers need to know before they consider adopting Cloud Computing models. We will talk about how to leverage the Cloud shared responsibility model to your advantage, and why Cloud security and compliance is not optional.

hi everyone and welcome to our talk

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,399
adopting cloud computing models could be

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
a blessing or a curse

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
when done with securing compliance in

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,280
mind it could save you lots of time

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,480
effort and operational costs when done

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,240
without regard to

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,400
security and compliance it could result

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
in exposing your company to financial

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,320
and reputational risks

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
in this lightning talk we will focus on

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,840
the cloud-shared responsibility model

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,560
and how to leverage it to your advantage

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
and i'm david laboch an ibm

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,200
distinguished engineer focusing on data

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,239
and ai

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
software as a service

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
many of us are are turning into cloud

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
and want to concentrate on getting value

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
and not spending valuable resources on

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,920
supporting functions of our workloads we

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
outsource

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
where we could benefit though on this

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
journey to cloud one needs to rethink

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
roles and responsibilities for securing

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
workloads and data in a traditional

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
on-premise environment we have full

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,320
control

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
and responsibility for securing our

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
workloads

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
yet this is not the case if we move our

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,479
workloads to the cloud

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
cloud security roles and

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,560
responsibilities differ based on cloud

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,360
delivery model you use

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
whether it's is pass sas or even a

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,119
combination of them

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
two main stakeholders mentioned on the

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,000
european general data production

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,840
regulation

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,479
gdpr are controllers and processors

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
the controller is typically the customer

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,680
acting as a data controller for any

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
personal contact

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,920
content they have on their cloud

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
environment and determining the purpose

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
and means for processing

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,159
of personal data the processor typically

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
is the role of the cloud service

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,360
provider

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
processing personal data on behalf of

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,079
the controller

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,159
at it a good example is the

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,840
responsibility over securing privileged

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
access to cloud workloads

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
managing privileged access to sensitive

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,280
data is a shared responsibility between

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,399
the processor and the controller

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
of the data as defined by gdpr however

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,599
in the survey

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
shown here an alarming 60 of

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,800
organizations

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
incorrectly view the cloud provider as

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
being the solely

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
responsible for securing privileged

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
access to cloud workloads

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
if you read your agreement with your

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
cloud provider you'll find that this

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
isn't true

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
it's shocking how many public cloud

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
customers are assuming that the cloud

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
service providers can completely protect

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
their customized

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
highly individualized cloud workloads

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,680
during cloud migrations the majority of

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
the companies

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
surveyed stated that they overlooked the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,720
shown above security controls

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
relating to privileged access to defend

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
against

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
breaches and address a portion of shared

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
responsibility models

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
organizations need to establish security

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
practices

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,120
and use security tools that are purpose

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
built for cloud security

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
the shared responsibility models are one

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
of the least understood but most

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
impactful components of cloud risk

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
management according to the cloud

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
security alliance

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
the root cause of many security

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,360
incidents is an assumption that the

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,560
cloud provider is handling something

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,720
when it turns out nobody's handling it

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,319
in his book practical cloud security

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,760
chris dawson explains the shared

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
responsibility model

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,400
using the analogy of eating pizza the

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
traditional on-premise world is like

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
making pizza at home

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,200
you buy lots of different components

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,920
make the dough assemble the pizza

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
yourself

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
it takes effort but you get complete

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
flexibility

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
when you use the infrastructure as a

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,200
service though the base layer is already

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
prepared for you you add whatever you

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,920
need to add

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
picky yourself and you're responsible

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,959
for these things

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,040
when you move up to platform as a

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
service more decisions are big for you

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,519
and you just use that base as part of

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,519
developing your end solution

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
with pizza as a service you're hungry

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,080
for pizza you can just go sit down at a

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,680
restaurant and order a pizza

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
sometimes it can be difficult to

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
categorize a service as

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
is or pass and they are growing together

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,599
in many cases

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
the exact classification isn't important

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,200
what's important is that you understand

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,080
what a service provider does

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
and what your responsibilities are when

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
you get to software as a service it

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,160
might

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
seem like everything's done for you it

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,440
is not you still have the responsibility

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,359
to eat safely

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
and although some might disagree but the

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,800
restaurant should not be responsible if

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
you choke on your food

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
in sas world this largely comes down to

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
managing access

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
controls properly

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
the reality of cloud computing is

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
unfortunately

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
a little more complicated than eating

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,360
pizza and there are some gray areas

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
at the bottom of the diagram things are

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,880
concrete

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
often literally the cloud provider has

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,960
complete responsibility

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
for physical infrastructure security

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
which often involves controls beyond

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
what companies can reasonably do on

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
premises such as

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,520
biometric access with anti-tailgating

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
measures

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,360
security guards and similar controls to

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,479
keep unauthorized personnel

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
out of the physical facilities some

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,759
cloud providers

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
offer the option of running workloads on

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,919
dedicated hosts

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
for a higher cost of course if you

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,120
choose to run

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,960
on a multitenant virtualized environment

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
the security controls keeping your

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
virtual environment

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,759
separate from other customers virtual

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,720
environments

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,039
are the provider's responsibility when

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
the spectra and meltdown vulnerabilities

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,280
came to light in early 2018

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
one of the potential effects was that

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
the users in one virtual machine

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
could read the memory of another virtual

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
machine on the same physical computer

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
for is customers fixing that part of the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
vulnerability was the responsibility of

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,639
the cloud provider

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
but fixing the vulnerabilities within

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
the operating system

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,160
was the customer's responsibility

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,560
network security is shown as a shared

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,240
responsibility

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
as there are several layers of

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
networking and the responsibility for

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
each lice with a

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,160
different party the cloud provider has

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
its own network that is

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,319
its responsibility but there is usually

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
a virtual network on top

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,680
and that's the customer's responsibility

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
to carve up

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
into reasonable security zones and put

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
the proper

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,240
access controls and rules around them

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
many implementations also use overly

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
networks firewalls

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
transport encryption that are the

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,960
customer's responsibility

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
operating system security is usually

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
your responsibility

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
if you're using is and it's the

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,400
customers

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,360
sorry the provider's responsibility if

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,960
you're purchasing

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,440
platform or software services in general

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,199
if you're purchasing those services you

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,880
have no access to the underlying

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
operating system

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,120
as a general rule of thumb if you have

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,520
the ability to break it

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,039
you usually have the responsibility for

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
securing it

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,599
middleware in this context is a generic

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,639
name for software such as databases

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,479
application servers or queuing systems

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,199
if they're in the middle between the

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,280
operating system and the application

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
they're typically not directly used by

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
end users

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,599
but used to develop solutions for end

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,759
users

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,240
if you're using a pass middleware

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,639
security is often a shared

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,560
responsibility

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
the provider might keep the software up

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
to date but you retain the

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,280
responsibility for securing

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
relevant settings such as encryption the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,240
application

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,039
layer is what the end user actually uses

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
if you're using sas vulnerabilities at

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
this layer

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
such as cross-site scripting or sql

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
injection

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,080
are the provider's responsibility even

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
if all of the other layers have

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,160
bulletproof security

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
a vulnerability at the application

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
security layer

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
can easily expose all of your

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
information

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,680
finally data access security is almost

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,000
always your responsibility as a customer

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
if you incorrectly tell your cloud

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,599
provider to allow access to a specific

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,440
data set

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,160
such as granting incorrect storage

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,479
permissions middleware permissions or

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,479
sas permissions there's really nothing

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,879
the provider can do

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,960
many real world examples of security

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,400
incidents stem from poor understanding

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,039
of the shared responsibility model

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,960
and came from object storage buckets

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
even if the storage solution

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,000
you use is secure and encrypted it

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
wouldn't help if you don't set your

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
access controls properly

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,240
this misunderstanding has caused the

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,120
loss of data on 198 million u.s voters

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,640

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,640

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,800
over 3 million demographic survey

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,170

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,519
[Applause]

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,880
what is the water line of the iceberg of

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
your workload

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,519
we hope you found our introduction of

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,120
the shared responsibility model useful

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,720
as a tool to assess and classify your

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,040
responsibilities for your workloads

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
we would love to stay in touch please
