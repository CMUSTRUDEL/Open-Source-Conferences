TiFlash: Make TiKV 10x Faster and HTAP-able - Xiaoyu Ma, PingCAP 

HTAP is a hard problem to deal with due to multiple design conflicts such as workload interference and storage format.  In this topic, I will share the details of TiFlash, which is a columnar engine for TiKV.   It provides consistent, latest and isolated columnar replicas and huge performance improve in analytical workloads. It enables TiDB / TiKV in real-time analytics and HTAP scenarios.   TiFlash relies on multi-raft to archive consistent / scalable heterogeneous replication for a distributed system like TiKV.  In topic I will present   1. Why HTAP is hard  2. How we designed system  3. What's the performance improve
