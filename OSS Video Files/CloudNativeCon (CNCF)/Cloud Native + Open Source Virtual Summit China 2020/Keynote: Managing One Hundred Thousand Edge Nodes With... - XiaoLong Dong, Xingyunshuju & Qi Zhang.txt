Keynote: Managing One Hundred Thousand Edge Nodes With Kubernetes in China's Highway - XiaoLong Dong, Xingyunshuju & Qi Zhang, Huawei 

Ministry of Transport of the P.R.C has been building a electronic toll collection system. There are around one hundred thousand edge nodes(mixed x86 and ARM) running over five hundred thousands containers distributed in the whole of China. This system is built based on Kubernetes. And here are some more problems need to deal with. For example, edge nodes need to work offline sometimes, the network bandwidth is too low to transfer the status for so much deployments. So KubeEdge is introduced into the platform to do edge nodes management and application deployment. It's now managing containers in more than ten thousands highway toll stations and addressing 300 million data records everyday. In this presentation,Xiaolong and Qi would cover: 1) The reason why choose kubernetes, and major challenges 2) How applications are deployed and managed at edge. 3) Achievements and lessons learned.
