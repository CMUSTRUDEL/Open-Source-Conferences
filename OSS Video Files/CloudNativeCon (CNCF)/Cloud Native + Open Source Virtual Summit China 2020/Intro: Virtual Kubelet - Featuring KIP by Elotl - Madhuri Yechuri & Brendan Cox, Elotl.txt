Intro: Virtual Kubelet - Featuring KIP by Elotl - Madhuri Yechuri & Brendan Cox, Elotl 

Virtual-kubelet enables you to super charge new and existing kubernetes clusters to break away from pet worker nodes. This talk will go through how virtual-kubelet’s provider framework was designed with built-in flexibility for supporting various compute types for your pods. This talk will also go through why Elotl chose virtual-kubelet for delivering Nodeless Kubernetes and how Elotl’s KIP provider was designed to work with virtual-kubelet. We will walk through uses cases of virtual-kubelet + KIP including a demo of cloud bursting using virtual-kubelet + KIP!
