Intro: Introduction to Open Policy Agent - Tim Hinrichs, Styra 

This session introduces the Open Policy Agent (OPA) project. OPA is a general-purpose policy engine used by hundreds of companies for policy enforcement across the stack. Use cases include compliance & admission control for Kubernetes, configuration validation for CI/CD systems, API authorization for microservices, data filtering for apps, and more. Attendees can expect to learn about OPA’s core features as well as integrations like Gatekeeper and Conftest. This is an excellent session to attend if you are new the cloud native ecosystem or want to get started with OPA.
