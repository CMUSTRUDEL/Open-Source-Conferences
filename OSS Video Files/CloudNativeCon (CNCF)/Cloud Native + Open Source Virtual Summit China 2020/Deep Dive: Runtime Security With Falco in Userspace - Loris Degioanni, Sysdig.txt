Deep Dive: Runtime Security With Falco in Userspace - Loris Degioanni, Sysdig 

In this talk Loris will discuss the tradeoffs for using different backend drivers to access systemcall information for cloud native security with Falco. We learn about eBPF, kernel modules, and ptrace(2). Loris will discuss other approaches considered and the performance impact with other solutions such as LD_PRELOAD. Loris shares deep knowledge and expertise in the matter and draws on years of contributing to wireshark, and creating sysdig and falco.
