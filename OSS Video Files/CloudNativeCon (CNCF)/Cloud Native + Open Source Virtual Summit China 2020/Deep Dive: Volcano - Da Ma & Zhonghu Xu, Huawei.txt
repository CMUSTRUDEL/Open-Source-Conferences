Deep Dive: Volcano - Da Ma & Zhonghu Xu, Huawei 

Volcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. It provides a suite of mechanisms that are commonly required by many classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning, bioinformatics/genomics and other "big data" applications. These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with. This deep dive session will will give an introduction on project Volcano, including the features that required by many batch/elastic workload, e.g. big data, AI, and HPC. And demonstrate the benefit of using Volcano in those scenarios. At the end of the session, the roadmap and future plan will be introduced and the target scenarios.
