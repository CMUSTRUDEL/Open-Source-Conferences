Deep Dive: Unified Runtime Service Infrastructure for Containers and VMs - Yunwen Bai & Peng Du, Futurewei 

Nowadays cloud providers offer services orchestrating both containers and VMs with different runtime services. Kubernetes, being a container orchestration platform, uses CRI interfaces which is specifically designed for containers. Extending Kubernetes to support both container and VM types carries sizable challenges in terms of managing multiple runtimes, handling OP differences with container and VM workloads, etc.  In this talk, Peng and Yunwen present a new runtime infrastructure which is designed to address those challenges. They will dive deep into modification in Kubelet for managing multiple runtime services, workload-runtime late binding, partial runtime readiness handling, and the unified runtime interfaces that support both containe and VM workloads and operations such as reboot, snapshot, migration, etc. They will conclude the talk with lessons learned and future works.
