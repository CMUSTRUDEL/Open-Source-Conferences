Introduction to NATS Streams and Services on Kubernetes - Waldemar Quevedo, Synadia 

Streams and Services are the two main building blocks for creating applications using NATS.  Streams are perfect for emitting and consuming data whereas Services can be used for endpoints that expect a response (aka RPC).  Furthermore, with NATS v2 features you can use these to model the flows of your data with imports and exports that are isolated via account namespaces for multi-tenancy.  In this talk, you will learn how to architect your distributed application in terms of streams and services all plugged into NATS, as well as how to best use the tooling in the `nats-io/k8s` to setup a secure multi-region NATS deployment in Kubernetes using NATS Gateways and Leafnodes.
