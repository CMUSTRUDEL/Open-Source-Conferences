A DSL Framework for Kubernetes Abnormal Configuration Detection - Jing Gu & Jun Deng, Alibaba 

Abnormal configuration detection is a very important activity in cluster operation, especially for cluster upgrade. However, with the evolution of Kubernetes, it has become very difficult to detect cluster abnormal configurations. This proposal presents a DSL framework for detecting Kubernetes abnormal configurations. The framework is made up of the reporter builder and the reporter execution. The reporter builder allows users to freely combine configurations which to be detected. And the reporter execution allows users to define the way to detect configurations using DSL. This framework supports a variety of data sources and collection methods. It can also be used with OpenKruise Broadcast Job to issue detection tasks, and also can be used with NPD.  The DSL framework supports many kubernetes-based products on Alibaba and guarantees tens of thousands of clusters upgrade successfully.
