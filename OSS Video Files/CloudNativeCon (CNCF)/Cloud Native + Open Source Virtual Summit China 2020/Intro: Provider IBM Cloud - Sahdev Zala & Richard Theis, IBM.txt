The Provider IBM Cloud is a subproject of the Cloud Provider SIG. In this session, the Provider IBM Cloud leads will provide an introduction of the project, and brief about the activities and GitHub repo on Kubernetes Cluster API Provider IBM Cloud. This will be followed by an overview of IBM Provider used by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, and how the provider leverages the Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager.
