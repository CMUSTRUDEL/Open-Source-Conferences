hello and thank you for having me today

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,919
my name is jim zemlin i'm the executive

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,160
director of the linux foundation

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,519
and i'm coming to you today from big sur

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,280
california

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
where i'm in a wonderful place with my

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
family and very happy to be with all of

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,880
you

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,359
today you know these are difficult times

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
the pandemic has thrown our global

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,680
society

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,800
into a health crisis we see

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,640
economic crisis also resulting from that

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,200
and it seems like every day there's

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
conflict all over the world

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,480
but one thing i want to remind all of

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
you today is that

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,840
open source is one of these great

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,200
movements

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
where collaboration working together

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
getting along is the very essence of

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,719
what we do

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,680
that open source is not a zero-sum game

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
but it has had an incredible impact on

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
all of us

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,359
in a very net positive way

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,879
i'd like to remind everyone that open

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
source is a freely available public good

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
that will be available to everyone at

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
any time

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,439
all around the world no matter what the

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,920
winds of

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:19,040
political or economic change bring us

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,560
and the linux foundation is dedicated to

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
all of that today we're working hard to

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
help folks during

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
hard times expanding our mentorship

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,880
programs

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
with over a quarter million dollars in

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
new donations

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,200
to allow opportunity for people to come

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,240
in and train themselves on new skills

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,159
during this tough time we've had a

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,000
wonderful set of virtual events

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
with thousands of people from hundreds

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,320
of companies working and countries

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,040
from all over the world working together

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,680
we want to bring the power of open

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,479
source

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
to help during these times and have a

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
number

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,360
of new initiatives that we're working on

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,759
most notably our recently launched linux

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,600
foundation public health initiative

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,439
which has started with seven premier

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,959
members

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,239
dock ai geometer ibm

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360
near forum tencent and vmware and is

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
hosting

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
uh exposure notification projects such

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
as covid shield

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
and covid green which are currently

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
being deployed

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,520
in canada ireland and several u.s states

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,440
to help find and reduce

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,840
the uh spread of covet 19.

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
in addition we've been working on a huge

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
number of new initiatives which i'll

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,959
talk about

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,120
but i'd like to start with reminding you

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
about what we're all here to talk about

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
which is cloud computing

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,560
and cloud how much cloud computing has

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,560
impacted all of us

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
microservices is an important part of

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
that and in china what we're seeing

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
is the tars project of microservices

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
framework

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
really taking off two years ago tara's

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
joined the linux foundation

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
and ever since the community has been

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
growing

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
and new projects and contributors have

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
been coming in

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
the tarz project provides a mature high

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,080
performance

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
microservices framework that supports

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
multiple programming languages

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,959
we will talk more about the tars

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,319
foundation in a little bit

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
uh but the microservices ecosystem has

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,599
been growing

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,000
and it's quickly turning application and

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,239
ideas into scale

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
in addition to tars we've been seeing

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
amazing work going on in the open source

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,519
community

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,959
starting with things such as the

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
software package data

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,720
exchange specification which was

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
recently contributed

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,840
as an international specification to

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,480
the iso iec jtc1 for approval

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,439
this will help all of us track the usage

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
of open source

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
software across a complex global supply

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
chain

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,920
and once again reaffirms our commitment

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,159
to a global movement

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
in addition we've seen growth in

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,319
projects with recent releases

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
such as in our networking projects with

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,680
the open network automation platforms

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
frankfurt release

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
which is being used to automate the

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,880
networks and edge computing services

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,680
for telecommunications providers cloud

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,639
providers and

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
enterprises we've seen new projects join

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,440
our organization

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
one good example is ml flow this project

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,160
was contributed to

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,919
our organization from databricks

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,000
this is a project that has had an

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,360
impressive community of over 200

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
contributors

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,320
that have been done and has been

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,880
downloaded more than 2 million times

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,479
ml flow as part of the linux foundation

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,639
ai initiative

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,160
is going to be a neutral home with an

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
open governance model

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
to help broaden the adoption and

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,120
contributions of things like

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,800
ml flow we've also seen new projects

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
come to our organization

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
such as the finnos foundation a

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,360
consortium of financial services

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,080
companies

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,199
working together to help grow the use of

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,720
open source

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,720
throughout our global financial system

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,800
it's been amazing to see all the

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
different projects that have been coming

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
but today what i'd like to do is

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,080
formally introduce

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,720
the tars foundation tarz has been

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
an amazing project and in just the last

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
few years

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,600
i've noticed that developers here in

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,080
china are for the first time

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
incubating and sharing new open source

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
projects not just here in china but in

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
the rest of the world

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
and the rest of the world is watching

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,919
the project of

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,800
that open source project and seeing

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
all the amazing work and are so proud of

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
the work that

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
is coming out of tars and you know just

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
like the linux foundation

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,479
is more than linux the tars foundation

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,919
is more about tars more than just tars

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,319
it's a microservices ecosystem

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,440
unfortunately because of the kovid 19

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
pandemic

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
we had to cancel the linux foundation

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,440
member summit this spring

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
and were unable to announce the taurus

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
foundation at that time

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
but today the linux foundation is proud

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
to announce

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,720
again the tarz project has become the

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
tars foundation

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,199
an open source microservice foundation

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
within the overall framework of the

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039
linux foundation

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,360
and its outcome has been rapid growth

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,280
for both the taurus project

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,639
and projects associated with tars

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,759
tars has really taken off

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,039
and it's just amazing to see

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,120
the amount of a development and we hope

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
that the taurus foundation will create a

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,520
neutral home for additional projects

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,840
for solving major problems around multi

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
micro services including but not limited

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,639
to agile development

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,479
devops best practices

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
and this comprehensive governance that

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
we have will enable

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
a multi-language high-performance

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
scalable solution

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,479
so it is my pleasure to present what the

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,400
taurus foundation has achieved in the

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,680
open source community

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,520
there are many companies whose

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,280
contributions are instrumental in

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,919
establishing the tires

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,560
microservices ecosystem and the taurus

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
foundation

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
is proof of that currently the taurus

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,880
foundation has

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,440
armed 10 cent as premier members

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,319
and five general members aftership

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,520
ampier

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
ap 17 kong and zen layer in terms of

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
tar's applications

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
it's serving more than 100 companies

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,599
from different industries

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,599
including edge esport fintech streaming

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,720
e-commerce entertainment

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,720
telecommunications education and more

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
furthermore the taurus foundation is

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,000
striving to expand its microservices

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
ecosystem

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,599
and incorporating more functions such as

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,639
