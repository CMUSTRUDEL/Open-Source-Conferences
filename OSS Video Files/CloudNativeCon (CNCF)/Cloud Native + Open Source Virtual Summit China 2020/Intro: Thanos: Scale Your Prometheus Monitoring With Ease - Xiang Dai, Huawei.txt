Intro: Thanos: Scale Your Prometheus Monitoring With Ease - Xiang Dai, Huawei 

Thanos is an open-source CNCF Sandbox project that builds upon Prometheus components to create a global-scale highly available monitoring system. It seamlessly extends Prometheus in a few simple steps and it is already used in production by dozens of companies that aim for high multi-cloud scale for metrics while keeping low maintenance cost. During this talk, Xiang Dai, maintainer of Thanos will explain basic concepts behind the project, its use cases, and tradeoffs. You will learn where to start and how to quickly deploy Thanos on Kubernetes without impacting your existing Prometheus setup. This talk is recommended for beginners that want to know more about running highly available Prometheus setup at scale with potentially unlimited metric retention with the lowest possible effort and cost.
