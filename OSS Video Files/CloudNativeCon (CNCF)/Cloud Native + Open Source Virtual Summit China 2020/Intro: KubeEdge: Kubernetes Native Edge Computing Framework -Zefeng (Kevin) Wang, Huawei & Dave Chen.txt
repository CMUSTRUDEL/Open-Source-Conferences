Intro: KubeEdge: Kubernetes Native Edge Computing Framework - Zefeng (Kevin) Wang, Huawei & Dave Chen, ARM 

KubeEdge is an open source edge computing framework that extends the power of kubernetes from central cloud to edge. It provides edge autonomy, application management and service communication across cloud and edge sites, device management for multiple IoT/Edge device communication protocols with lightweight implementation. During this talk, Kevin and Dave will review KubeEdge motivation, architecture; then go through latest updates on new features and user adoptions. After that Kevin and Dave will introduce where the project is heading to, new SIGs going to be set up and how new contributors to get involved. There will be an open Q&A for attendees to ask questions.
