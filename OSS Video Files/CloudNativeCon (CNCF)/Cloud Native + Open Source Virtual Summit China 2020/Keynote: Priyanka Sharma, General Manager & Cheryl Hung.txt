00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
slides really quickly so give me a

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
so as i said today we're going to be

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
talking about cloud native 2020 and

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
beyond

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
with the key partnership of china

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
our agenda today is to talk about the

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360
success story so far

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
the drivers of that success what our

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,560
partnership with china looks like

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,880
and then a thank you

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,000
so i took on this role about two months

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,000
ago and it's been an amazing ride so far

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
chris and dan khan have built a

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
phenomenal organization with cncf with

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
global impact

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,000
and i'm honored to continue to work with

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
them i've had a long history in cloud

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
native

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
and systems in the past and this is just

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,200
a great culmination of my efforts

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,000
to date so the cloud native success

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,160
story

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,879
i believe most of you have heard it but

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,959
just to reiterate

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,879
as we all know kubernetes came into the

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,200
landscape and changed the industry

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,400
fast this is a google trends report that

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,160
shows various

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
technologies including kubernetes and

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
you see the beautiful up and to the

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,200
right with the blue one which is

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
kubernetes

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,360
with the foundation that with the

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440
formation of the cncf which is the home

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
for kubernetes we have a lot more

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
projects

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,280
in fact it's 50 plus open source

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
projects

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,519
in cncf kubernetes is a highlight as

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,319
our prometheus envoy and many others

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,400
harbor

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,560
comes from china and that is going to be

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
joining this graduated list very shortly

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
in terms of members we have over 500

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
members in the foundation

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
and the platinum members include all of

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
the hyperscalers in the world the top 10

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
and that includes some illustrious

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
chinese companies

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,440
we have end users from around the world

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,519
and all of our members

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,519
represent all corners of the globe

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,879
the end users make me particularly proud

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,840
as a foundation we are the we

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,480
enjoy the largest end user community out

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
there

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,319
and that's because of all the effort of

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
the technologists the members

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,840
the the the evangelists the

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
cheerleaders all of you over there

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
we have a great momentum in the cloud

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
native ecosystem there's a lot of

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,440
activity with companies acquiring

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,799
each other in 2020 alone there have been

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
eight acquisitions

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
including rancher which was bought by

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
suse

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,720
so what have been the drivers of the

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
success

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,920
well it is our belief that open

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
governance

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,680
adds a layer to open source as described

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
by licensing

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
to make it a truly inviting ecosystem

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
for people to come in

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,439
contribute software and also benefit

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
from it as end users

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
many foundations have a prescribed way

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
but not us projects have their own

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
governance models

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
and all we ask is that there is

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
influence and control beyond

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,079
a single company we believe there's a

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,479
big difference between simply open

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
source

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,759
by licensing standards and open

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
governance

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
giving the end users a formal role has

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
been a big deal

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
for our success these end users are part

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
of the governing board the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
uh special interest groups the and and

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
they have their own end user community

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
you'll be hearing from cheryl shortly

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
and she'll tell you all the great things

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,880
that are going on but i strongly believe

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,600
that the end users are the foundation of

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
our success

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,360
with no king makers allowed we are able

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,400
to take in as i told you

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,800
close to 50 projects and that helps

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
bring various technologies to four bring

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
them all the resources that we can offer

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
and then those who succeed succeed

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,759
a very big reason we have been

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,240
successful are the global communities

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,320
we've built events throughout this is

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
one of them our investments in china

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
in eu in america all of those come

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
together

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
for a vibrant thriving ecosystem we have

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
50 members in china

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,199
and they're more than 10 of the total

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
cncf membership

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
and china is the third largest

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,759
contributors to cncf projects

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,160
i am so proud of all of you for all that

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,160
effort

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
so let's keep talking china and cloud

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,479
data

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
china stands as the number two

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,120
contributor to kubernetes and that is no

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,520
mean fact

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
cheers to you there are many

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
china-driven projects in the cncf such

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
as

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,759
cikv harbor dragonfly cube edge

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
there's a lot of excitement and momentum

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
and i am

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,400
so thrilled that that is happening you

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,039
over there

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,280
are a powerhouse of innovation of

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,000
technology and i'm glad you choose to

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
partner with us

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
there are many chinese end users the

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,759
foundation of our

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,800
uh foundation and i've listed 12

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,680
here like jd.com huawei paincap

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
so many folks

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,080
we believe that as chinese companies

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,639
scale software to deal with billions of

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,600
users innovative projects will continue

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
to be born

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
and they will be shared with the world

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,080
i'm thrilled for that personally

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,919
the challenge in my opinion will be

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
building these communities to have a

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,520
global developer audience in mind

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
and that's where we cncf can help

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,680
we hope you choose to continue to

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,560
partner with us

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
so what is this path forward for us well

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
as i mentioned

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,199
i truly believe that end user driven

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,319
open source

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,919
is the way to go we enjoy the largest

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
community of end users

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
folks are now starting to talk about

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
various technologies how they work for

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
them there's a lot of research you're

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
doing

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,240
cheryl will tell you more about this and

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
we're giving end users of safe space

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
to come together and have conversations

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
without every vendor

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,000
breathing down their neck we are truly

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,319
the foundation of doers with

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
end users building amazing technologies

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
with project creators building all the

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
foundations for those

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
and we want to keep focusing on that and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,720
build upon it to do the best we can for

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,120
all the doers out there

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080
i believe that developer education is a

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
key element

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,479
of this there's a as you all know

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
technology moves faster than water

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,720
and we need to be always at the

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
forefront to do our best jobs

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,960
cmcf takes that very seriously that's

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
why we've built out a lot of training

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,639
programs with
