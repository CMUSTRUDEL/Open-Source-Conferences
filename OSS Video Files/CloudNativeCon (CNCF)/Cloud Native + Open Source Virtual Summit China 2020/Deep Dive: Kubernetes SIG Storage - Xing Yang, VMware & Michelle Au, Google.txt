Deep Dive: Kubernetes SIG Storage - Xing Yang, VMware & Michelle Au, Google 

Kubernetes SIG Storage is responsible for ensuring that different types of file and block storage are available wherever a container is scheduled, storage capacity management (container ephemeral storage usage, volume resizing, etc.), influencing scheduling of containers based on storage (data gravity, availability, etc.), and generic operations on storage (snapshotting, etc.). In this session, we will deep dive into some projects that SIG Storage is currently working on, provide an update on the current status, and discuss what might be coming in the future.
