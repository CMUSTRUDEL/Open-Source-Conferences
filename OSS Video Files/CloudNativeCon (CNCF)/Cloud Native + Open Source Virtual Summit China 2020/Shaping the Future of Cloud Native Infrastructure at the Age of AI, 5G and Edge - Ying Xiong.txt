Shaping the Future of Cloud Native Infrastructure at the Age of AI, 5G and Edge - Ying Xiong, Futurewei 

The combination of next generation AI and 5G applications poses major challenges for cloud infrastructure platform to support low latency and high scalability requirements of future cloud workloads. The convergence of Edge with the Cloud is driving the innovation of cloud platform architecture for unified management and large scale geographic deployment across data center and edge infrastructure. In this talk, we introduce a new open source project that provides a highly scalable and truly multi-tenant cloud native infrastructure to build next generation public and/or private cloud. We will present two open source components - Arktos, the large scale and partitioned compute cluster with unified management of cloud resource and workload including VMs and container, and Mizar, the high performance and low latency cloud networking solution that leverages advanced network technologies such as XDP/eBPF and Geneva protocol. Together, Arktos and Mizar deliver a new generation of cloud platform aiming to meet the challenges in the age of AI, 5G and Edge. In this talk, we will also give the use case of autonomous driving that can benefit from the new open source project.

[Music]

00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,600
hello everyone welcome to this

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
lightning talk shipping the future of

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,599
cloud native

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
infrastructure in the age of ai 5g and

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,799
edge

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,920
my name is i'm with virtual technologies

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,920
today in this talk i'm really excited to

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
introduce you a new open source

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
project that is designed for next

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
generation applications

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,920
so let's go ahead and get started

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
first let's look at some of the

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,760
challenges that we are facing today

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
as the cloud adoption grows explicitly

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,680
the infrastructure platform needs to

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
manage larger and a larger

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
scale of compute and network resources

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,680
across

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
your graphic area the customer always

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,800
asks for

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
faster and faster provisioning of the

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
resources or

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,800
the applications additionally there is

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,840
an increasing need for

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,320
cloud operators to unify the management

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,239
of diverse type of resources

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,880
such as biometers vms containers and

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
serverless functions to just simply

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,280
reduce the management cost

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,439
and simplify overall operations

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
with the emergence of the new type of

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,960
workload such as ai 5g

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,840
and iot apps we see a train

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,040
that traditional cloud computing and

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
edge computing

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
are being converged into one distributed

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,119
cloud

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
this train requires that the current

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
infrastructure technologies

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
need to be redesigned or optimized to

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,720
support applications running

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,399
at resource constraint htmls that are

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,240
closer to the customer

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,360
and the customer data as a result

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,040
for those new type of work notes we need

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
a cloud instructor to be able to

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,840
internalize place

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,240
where the application should run in

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,560
order to improve custom experience

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,680
with low latency on a high circle

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,319
last but not least the train in the era

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,720
of qualitative continuous

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
due to its extremely scalable and

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
extensible design

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
we believe the modern cloud

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,920
infrastructure should

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,319
incorporate this qualitative design

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
pattern into the platform

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,000
to meet the challenges facing by new

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,319
generation of applications

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
so now i'm pleased to announce and

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,440
introduce you

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,959
the new open source projects called

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
centers

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
the goal of projects and tariffs is to

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
provide a

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
new infrastructure platform in a more

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
collaborative way

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
for any company to build scalable and

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
unified

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,680
infrastructure for the public or private

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
cloud

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
centerra's platform is designed from its

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
beginning

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,120
with hyper scale edge computing

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
and fast compute network provisioning in

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
mind

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,360
centaurus projects actually consist of

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,879
two side projects will name them arctus

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
and the misa

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,120
more detail on actors and the misa will

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,599
be discussed in the following slides

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
this is overall architecture of projects

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,680
and terrors

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,599
i won't be able to deep dive into this

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
architecture in detail

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
but i would like to mention a few

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,640
highlights

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
first regional scalability one of the

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,319
reasons

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,799
for the projects and terrors is able to

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,360
support a cost of 300 000 computer nodes

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
and be able to provision and managing

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
more than 10 million network endpoints

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,440
within a region so every component in

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,360
this architecture

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680
can be partitioned to handle large

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
number of requests

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
second this architecture natively

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
supports

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,599
edge computing is built in to

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
schedule run and manage applications at

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
age

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,920
size lastly

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
this architecture also offers the same

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
api experience

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,720
for both the vm and the containers as

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,400
well as for other type of workloads

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,440
he provides application-centric api

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,040
is a platform for both resource and

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
application orchestrations

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
centara's output components is derived

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,919
from

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,040
well-known kubernetes architecture

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,320
however we made some major redesigns

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,400
and extensions to the core of kubernetes

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
here is a list of the changes that were

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,880
made

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,600
partitioning and skin scalability in

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
architectures

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
api server etc store controllers

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
schedulers

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
all can be partitioned for large scale

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,680
deployment

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,479
multi-tenancy architectures introduce

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
the true

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
and hard model tendency into the

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
kubernetes

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
and make the platform a real modern data

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,280
platform

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,280
unified the runtime actors unify vm and

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
the container launcher into one

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,639
so that the platform manages vm in the

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
same way

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,720
as he manages containers

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
architects introduce new network object

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
types

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
in the corresponding operators this is a

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
part of

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
multi-tenancy model so that containers

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680
or vms

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,520
are created within subnet or vpc

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,880
and they are naturally isolated

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,520
built-in edge computing actors out of

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
the box

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,039
can manage computer nodes at 80 sites

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
and orchestrate applications running at

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,280
a resource constraint age

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,919
similarly centara's mesa component

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,240
is a network component that provisions

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
and manage the virtual network and the

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
process

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
network traffic visa itself has two

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
components

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
data plan and the managing plan the data

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
plan is built on top of a high

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,840
performance

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,319
xdp slash evpf programs

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
xdp programs running within the os

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
corner to perform

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,199
routing switching and another balance of

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
network traffic

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
these are using natural partitioning of

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,240
a cloud network such as vpc

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
and subnet to scale network endpoint

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
provisioning

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,039
for attending vms or containers as well

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
as for fast

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,759
networking forwarding visa management

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
plan

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,520
runs within a kubernetes and using

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
kubernetes crd and operator framework to

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
manage

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,160
virtual networks and the network package

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
routing policies

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,120
that's all for me for just a short talk

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
thank you very much for your listening

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
please meet our virtualbooth for more

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
