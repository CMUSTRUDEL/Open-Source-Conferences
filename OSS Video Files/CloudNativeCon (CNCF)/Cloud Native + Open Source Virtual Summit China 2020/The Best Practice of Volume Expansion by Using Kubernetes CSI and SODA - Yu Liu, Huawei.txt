The Best Practice of Volume Expansion by Using Kubernetes CSI and SODA - Yu Liu, Huawei 

In the past few years, with the continuous acceleration of enterprise digital transformation, cloud native has been favored by enterprises because of its advantages in agility and scalability. More and more enterprises choose to migrate their business to cloud native architecture. However, in the process, some problems will inevitably be encountered. One of them is how to better manage data and utilize storage resources on various cloud-native applications.  As an smart and open data autonomous management platform, SODA helps users achieve efficient use of data on cloud native. In this topic, SODA will show how to enable cloud-native applications to connect to the SODA northbound plug-in (NBP) to use the rich storage backend supported by SODA itself, without having to pay attention to the differences between different storage backend interfaces; In addition, it will show how to support the CSI expansion interface to enable users to more flexibly manage data on cloud native applications, so that everyone can better understand the simple and unified cloud native application data management experience that SODA can bring to users.
