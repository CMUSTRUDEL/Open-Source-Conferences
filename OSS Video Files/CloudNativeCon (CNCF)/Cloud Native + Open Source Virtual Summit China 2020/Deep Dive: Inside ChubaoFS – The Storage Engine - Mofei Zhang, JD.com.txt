Deep Dive: Inside ChubaoFS – The Storage Engine - Mofei Zhang, JD.com 

ChubaoFS is a distributed file system and object store providing both POSIX and S3 compatible interfaces for cloud native and traditional applications. In this presentation, Hongyin will dive into the obstacles encountered when using distributed file system in Kubernetes cluster in JD, and share some practical experience and thoughts on how to solve these problems. More specifically we will also present ChubaoFS, a distributed file system designed and built based on these thoughts (SIGMOD 2019), and analyze several typical use cases in and outside of JD. The meta nodes of ChubaoFS can be expanded dynamically which breaks the file amount limit. And the performance for small files can be scaled up while the performance for large files are also optimized. Hongyin is going deep dive into the architecture, development and details of ChubaoFS, and talks about topics like replications, failovers and so on.
