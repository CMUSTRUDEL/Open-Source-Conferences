Intro: K8s VMware User Group: Out-of-tree Cloud Provider and CSI Storage Migration - Steven Wong & Myles Gray, VMware 

This is a presentation by the recently formed Kubernetes VMware User Group. This group addresses running all forms of Kubernetes on VMware infrastructure. Kubernetes is in the process of deprecating the cloud provider and storage plugins that have historically been built into the source tree and directly packaged with many distributions. The new out-of-tree cloud provider and CSI storage plugin are now recommended for production use. The legacy plugins are no longer getting feature upgrades. However, when running on older hypervisor or Kubernetes releases, choices may be constrained. This session will cover the in vs out-of-tree feature and compatibility matrix, offer guidance on migration to out-of-tree - and cover documentation and support resources.
