A Universal Central IPAM for Pod With Multiple Network Interfaces - Mengxin Liu, Alauda 

When telecom industries decides to move to Kubernetes, migrating the existing complex network topology is the No.1 headache. Workloads with multiple network interfaces that resident in different type of networks, with fixed IPs or even with fixed public IPs are common requirements across the industry.    Some IPAMs focus on local address allocation and do not have the cluster wide info, like the host-local IPAM. Others are very implementation specific, like the Calico-IPAM. This speech will introduce a universal central IPAM that has a global view of different network type and address ranges and can provide advanced IPAM functions like subnets, fixed IPs and IP reservations to other CNI compatible network plugin.    This speech will also show a telecom example of how to use this IPAM to manage pods that resident at the edge with multiple networks.
