Antrea Project - Securing and Accelerating Kubernetes CNI - Vicky Liu, VMware 

Antrea is an open sourced, light-weight, and high performant CNI network plugin, providing pod connectivity and network policy enforcement with Open vSwitch as data plane. Antrea project is Kubernetes centric and aims to leverage Kubernetes-native solutions as much as possible to deliver a next-generation container networking solution. Antrea provides a set of visualization toolkits to ease the troubleshooting and debugging flow for complicated network issues. To achieve the high-speed pod networking, Antrea also actively integrates with smart NICs to accelerate the traffic. There are many exciting features in roadmap of Antrea and we look forward to engaging the community to advance our learning and realize them together.
