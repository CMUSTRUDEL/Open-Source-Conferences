Keynote: WASI - A new kind of system interface and what it means for cloud native - Lin Clark, Senior Principal Engineer, Fastly

The system interfaces we use today were designed in the 70s and 80s to power the systems that were prevalent at that time. But increasingly what a "system" even is, is much more open-ended. They include distributed applications spanning the cloud and edge networks, tiny IoT devices scattered throughout our homes, or platforms that embed sandboxes to run untrusted code. 

With the WebAssembly System Interface, we’re building a new kind of system interface to better support these kinds of systems. And with this shift, new opportunities are opening up.

In this talk, I’ll explain what all of this means for Cloud Native and some of the opportunities that could be unlocked.
