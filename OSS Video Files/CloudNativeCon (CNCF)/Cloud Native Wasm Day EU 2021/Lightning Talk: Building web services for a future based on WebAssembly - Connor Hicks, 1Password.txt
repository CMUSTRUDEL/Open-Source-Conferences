Lightning Talk: Building web services for a future based on WebAssembly - Connor Hicks, 1Password

In this talk, Connor will dive into Atmo, an open source framework designed for building cloud native applications using WebAssembly modules. Atmo is enabling developers to build their applications with the popular patterns of serverless computing, while harnessing the power and security of WebAssembly. Connor will show how WebAssembly makes it easier to deploy an application to the cloud by demonstrating Atmo's unique development patterns, easy to use APIs, and straightforward deployments. Connor will also be providing extensive example code and a deep dive into what makes WebAssembly the next iteration of cloud software development.
