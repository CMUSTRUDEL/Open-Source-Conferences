AI inference on the Edge cloud using WebAssembly - Michael Yuan, Second State

Michael Yuan will discuss options to run Tensorflow model inference on WebAssembly. Using a Mobilenet image classification task as an example, he will cover the plain JS approach, Tensorflow.js, pure Rust libraries for Tensorflow, and WASI-like Tensorflow extensions that run on specialized inference chips. The session will go through the journey of 60,000x performance gain over the evolution of WebAssembly. He will also discuss what’s the future for WebAssembly-based AI on the edge cloud.
