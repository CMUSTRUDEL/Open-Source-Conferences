okay everyone thank you so much for

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
coming to the cloud native lawson day

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,040
i'm going to wrap us up with some quick

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,120
closing remarks and two calls to action

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,480
uh first a gigantic thank you to our

elena vogel from cncf without whose work

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
today would not have been possible at

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
all

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
a second huge thanks to our sponsors our

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
two diamond sponsors

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,760
microsoft azure

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
and our community sponsor the bytecode

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,199
alliance make sure you take a few

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,719
minutes and check out buy code alliance

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,600
for more information about some of the

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
things that are going on in the

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
community today

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
now if anything was clear today it's

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
clear that

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
webassembly is in cloud native we see

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
web assembly running

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,080
on top of uh cloud native apps we see

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
webassembly

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
running inside of web cloud native apps

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
and we see web assembly running all

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,479
around

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,799
uh cloud native apps as we think about

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,560
um the huge variety of things that we

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
saw uh presented today

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
you know there's this one thing that

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
should just be absolutely clear

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
and it's something that i'm completely

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
convinced about and it's that

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
you know webassembly isn't just another

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
evolution technology

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
it is simply the next revolution in

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,439
technology

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
and we started out today with an opening

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
remarks from ralph and chris

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
who did a great job uh introducing us to

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
what we were going to go through this

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
morning and i would like to point out

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
that

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
today's session included people from

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
countries and cultures

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,079
and communities all around the world i

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
know that i logged in at 3am and there

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
were others that were logging in in

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
their afternoon or in their evening this

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,799
is really a global

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,399
movement here uh next we had a wonderful

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,040
keynote from lynn clark

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
who not only laid out the importance of

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,239
a

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
uh some operating system interfaces type

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
interfaces

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
that we need in order to help continue

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
to move this revolution forward

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
but also laid the future vision for

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
where we're going to be heading next

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
with interface types and some of the

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
other proposals

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
that are being developed in an open and

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
common way

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
kevin hoffman from capital one talked a

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,879
little bit about wasm cloud

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,519
and taking uh his napkin sketches in his

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,800
distributed application runtime

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,959
uh then we had michael juan talk about

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
ai inference on the edge and talked

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
about some of the incredible performance

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
benefits

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
we're seeing by embedding and running

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
web assembly

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
and combining it with the latest in

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,840
tensorflow and artificial intelligence

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,480
in the browser and on the server side

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
matt and taylor may have done what is my

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,200
maybe my most favorite themed

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,319
presentation today in their wasm in the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
wild wild west

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
where they did a wonderful job providing

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
not only an overview of some of the

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,720
great work that's coming out of the

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,599
open source group at microsoft azure but

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,200
also

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,640
laid out some of the major challenges

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,319
that we have in our ecosystem

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
some of the major opportunities we have

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,280
to come together as a community

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
uh uh then we had a wonderful uh

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
sponsored keynote

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,280
from uh uh takaya who talked about

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
secure extensibility by web assembly and

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,879
i really love the language that they

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
chose to use to bring today

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,319
around secure and extendable uh and

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,319
being embedded

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
it was a really well done presentation i

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,480
think they are really showing us

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,920
some new opportunities for how we can

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,920
use uh the technology

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
then we had michael womback again with

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
wasm as a service runtime

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
where uh he presented some of the

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,519
incredible performance benefits

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,120
uh that are that are possible and some

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
of the research that second state has

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
been leading

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,920
in the area of um uh comparing

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
runtime performance startup times and so

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
forth

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
as much as i don't like the adverse

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,439
language i really appreciate

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
the the real technical articulation of

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
the benefits

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
and the pros and cons that we have on

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
the technology

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
then we had our lightning talks and we

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
started with uh quarantine talking about

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
migrating from a javascript uh to

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
webassembly

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
uh then we had a great talk from connor

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,440
hicks who talked about atmo and his sufa

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
design pattern

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,120
and building web services with wasm

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,800
then we had uh the byte assembly walmart

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
presentation which is the web assembly

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
micro runtime

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,199
and i love that we've seen people

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
talking about

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
uh use cases on the biggest of hardware

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
uh later

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
uh uh in today we had andrew brown and

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
ming cu

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639
from intel talking about um you know

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
leveraging this technology on big iron

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,919
uh and here we have it running on the

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
smallest which i think

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
really plays to the diverse uh you know

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
how diverse

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
and what a real revolution this

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,280
technology is uh then we had matt taylor

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
uh matt taylor matt butcher and taylor

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
thomas uh back again to talk about

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
bindle

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
uh which is uh sort of a rethink about

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
how we might package our applications

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,880
and distribute them

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
uh for next generation applications

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
then we had robert talking about

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
serverless wasm for compute intensive

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,160
workloads

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,560
uh and he was doing some demos um around

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
how you could leverage wasm to get these

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
performance routines and i think also

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,880
did a really great job talking about

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,080
how some of we have some of the new edge

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,320
related companies

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,240
are leveraging web assembly and how that

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
might come into play in a truly cloud

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
native world

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
uh then andrew brown and ming cusan uh

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
with their machine learning

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
uh with waziyan which is actually

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
already committed uh as an

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,800
optional plug-in in the wasm time uh uh

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,639
host runtime that's available from uh

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
fastly in the bytecode alliance

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,440
uh so this is something that you can go

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
out and play with uh today

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
then i did a quick overview around why i

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,319
really believe that

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,639
web assembly is the future of

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
distributed computing and i tried to lay

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,600
out

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,039
some of the uh what does this really

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
mean for us as a community

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,199
and really tried to reach out to a

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
diverse uh group of uh audience and

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,360
speakers there

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
uh finally uh we closed up with a really

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
well put together presentation from

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,560
shane

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,560
and you've all around wasm filters for

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
envoy which was another great talk that

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,759
really emphasized

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
the embeddability and the plugability of

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,800
webassembly

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,400
as a as a technology and i think today

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
in being on the program committee one of

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,800
the things that we really tried to do

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
in putting today's content together was

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
not really just was not

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
just focus on the intersection of

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
webassembly and cloud native

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
but try to focus on a broad range of

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
technologies that exist

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,599
across today's landscape because it is

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,000
clear that web assembly is running

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,199
on in and around cloud native

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
applications today

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,599
i and there should be a place for it

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
when we think about what's next in the

00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,840
short term

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
i think you could throw out a lot of

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
different answers to this you could talk

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
about the technical roadmap you could

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
talk about

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
the innovations you can talk about the

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
places that we're going to use that

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
but i really think that there's only one

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
right answer to that question

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,479
and that is that community is next

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
because

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
when we think about what we really need

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
to be successful as a group

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,759
it's not just pulling together brilliant

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,639
ideas and road maps

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
and plans forward we really need to uh

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
make sure that we're

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,720
building the content the solutions the

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
comparisons

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
the white papers to arm not only

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,280
engineers

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,039
but managers and marketing and sales and

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,039
customer success and all of the other

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,680
orgs that are going to come into

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
a successful transition and adoption of

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,960
the next

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
uh of this next revolution in technology

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,720
as for what is immediately next

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
i would love to make sure and do a call

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
out that there's actually one more

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
activity today sponsored by microsoft

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
azure

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
uh the birds of a feather session for a

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
cloud native web assembly landscape with

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,680
ralph

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,039
squillus where we're going to try to sit

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
down and chat through

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,080
what might a web assembly landscape uh

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
look like

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
what would be the sort of key areas

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
today alone we saw a number of themes we

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
saw

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
a couple of we saw a number of host

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,919
runtimes mentioned

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,039
we saw a number of application runtimes

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
mentioned we saw

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,599
multiple approaches to machine learning

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
we saw multiple orgs talking about

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
embedding web assembly

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,160
what are the sort of characteristics of

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
these things

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
and we'll maybe try to take a first

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,319
rough pass at sketching that out

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,159
you know regardless of what you feel is

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,039
next and i i know there's always the

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,080
tendency to pit

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,919
applications and uh transitions um

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
off of each other to talk about why

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,599
things are better the one thing that

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
really resonated with me today is

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
that today we're in this great situation

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
where we find that

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,080
cloud native and web assembly are both

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,080
working well together

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,080
and i think that would be the theme and

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
the overarching message that i would

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
love for everybody to really embrace as

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
we think through

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
the next year and the next few years of

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,959
webassembly as a community is is that

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,560
while webassembly as a technology may

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
not be dependent upon

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,600
it is certainly compatible with the

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,760
things that we're doing

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,279
in the cloud native world and it opens

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
up new possibilities

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,880
for what it even means to be cloud

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
native so thank you very much for your

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,440
time i really look forward to

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,600
you joining us at the birds of a feather

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
session sponsored by microsoft azure

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,120
and i just want to say thank you to all

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
the attendees

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
because really at the end of the day

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,839
it's going to be as a community that

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,160
we're successful

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
