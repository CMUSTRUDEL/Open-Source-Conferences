Cloud Native Rust Workshop: Let's go parallel with Rust - Florian Gilcher & Sabree Blackmon, Ferrous Systems GmbH

In this session, we are going to build a small Rust server together. We’ll start with a simple server that accepts and delivers data through a simple TCP protocol.

Then, we will start using threads to parallelise the process. After that, we will rewrite the same project in an async fashion.

This way, you will get a basic feel for Rust and its concurrency features.
To follow the session, I recommend that have Rust installed through https://rustup.rs (rustup may also be available in your distributions package manager) and have rust-analyzer set up.
