all right i think that might be our cue

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,839
hello good morning

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,799
um awesome good morning everybody

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,400
um it is 3 30

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,760
a.m for both ian and chris so

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,800
very very good morning

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,080
from us anyway uh welcome

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,039
um thank you for coming um this is the

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,239
inaugural the first uh cloud native rust

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
day

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,360
so born through

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,160
tweet um formed by a lot of hard work

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,840
um by the program committee and the cncf

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
um

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,360
so just want to quickly sort of

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,960
introduce the conference

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,320
why are we here um and and really just

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
kick-start off uh to what i think will

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
be a very very cool

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,760
day i'm looking forward to all the talks

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
and it's going to be

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
awesome so anyway um if you don't know

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
already

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,400
um i'm spree blackman i'm at heavy

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,600
packets basically everywhere

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
i work for critical section um which is

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,240
a subsidiary of fair systems

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,119
really focused on mission and safety

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,720
critical

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,799
uh rust and making rust sort of you know

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
the premier language for for some of

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,280
those uh

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,880
for those some of those projects um and

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
joined by chris you want to introduce

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
yourself

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,560
you are muted they're ready in the

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
morning but hey

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
chris santa anazik i have the fun job of

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
serving as cto of the quantitative

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
computing foundation

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
ensuring that our projects are healthy

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
and uh well supported

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,880
um you know i want to thank sabri for

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
kind of spearheading uh this idea given

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,840
kind of the adoption

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,799
of rust in the cncf ecosystem is now our

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,360
second most popular programming language

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
for cncf projects behind the obviously

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
popular golang so excited to be here

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
today so

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,399
kicking it back to you sabri awesome

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
yeah um

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,599
it's kind of to think that russ is the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
number two language

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,599
in 2021 is kind of blowing my mind a

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,640
little bit

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,760
so but that kind of makes

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,800
this the correct time i think to to

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,080
to start a conference like this um

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,519
so um make this really brief

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,200
um why are we here um i think you know

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
rust is quickly becoming a foundational

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
language obviously for

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,319
um for cloud and a lot of internet

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,760
infrastructure

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,360
there are a lot of technical reasons for

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,959
that um you know

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
safety there's strong patterns

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,519
performance energy efficiency

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
the rest of the conference will cover

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
that in

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,879
depth so i won't get into that here

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
but while people discover trust because

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
of those things

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
they often stay for the community or

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
they stay because

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,360
rust as a project is really focused on

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000
developer productivity

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
and just developer health in general and

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
making sure

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,599
that the experience for anyone who has

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,040
to work with us on a daily basis

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,519
is a good one um and so

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,799
you know we have all of us come from

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
diverse personal and professional

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
backgrounds

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
uh yet we're really building a

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,640
programming language to fulfill

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,319
a pretty diverse set of needs so today

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
we're kind of here talk about rust in

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,920
the context of cloud and internet

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
internet infrastructure

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
we'll see some more hardware focused

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
source hardware-centric

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,360
talks today some security-centric talks

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,400
today uh

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
microservices and you know everything

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,239
that sort of falls under the umbrella

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,280
under of the cncf

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,799
and really to provide a rust-centric

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
context for the rest of kukan

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,920
which i hope everyone is also looking

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
around to

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,599
um that's gonna be a lot of fun so

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,439
um my goal personally my personal goal

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,680
at the end of the conference is that

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
you will leave with enough information

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,320
and enough

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
context to consider rust for your next

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
project

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,320
whether it's a tool whether it's an

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320
application

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
whatever you're doing in the context of

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
cloud to consider rest and hopefully

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,479
this

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
you know the next couple of hours will

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,560
provide you with some good context there

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,919
there is a workshop

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,320
as well i don't know what time

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,080
that starts not central time so look at

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,199
the schedule

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
um later uh um and that

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
is you know if you want a bit more

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,000
in-depth uh

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,280
sort of overview of rust in the context

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,039
of cloud cloud native um

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,680
definitely uh join up with that um

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,680
so i have so um finally you know i said

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,320
thanks to the cncf for putting on

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,080
and sponsoring this event um thanks to

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,800
the rest of the program committee

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,600
um we're going to spend i think

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
literally across the world at this at

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
this point

uh kubecon europe um you know this is

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
truly about

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,039
you know knowledge sharing of how

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
rustling is used throughout the cloud

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
native ecosystem

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,160
i also want to thank the other program

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,199
committee members uh like anna

but uh truly look forward to uh seeing

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
everyone and sharing the knowledge about

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
how russ landing is used in the cncf and

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,080
cloud native ecosystem so thank you

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,600
sabri again

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,360
yep um last remark um there is a

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
code of conduct i would recommend you

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,120
read it over if you haven't already

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
if you have any issues technical issues

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
any kind of questions feel free to reach

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,600
out on slack

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
there is a rust channel a cloud native

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,319
rust day

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,919
channel on slack when you make sure it

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,520
is the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,560
yeah so it is uh number three dash cloud

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
native dash rest

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
day dash day excuse me do a search for

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,800
rust

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,240
it'll come up um please join that um for

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,520
just like long-form communication i

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
think that'll be

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,039
open and around for at least a few weeks

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
after the conference is done so that'll

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,240
be a great place to

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
sort of congregate ask cloud specific

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
questions and stuff like that

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
um yeah that's all i have so thank

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,000
everybody

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,840
and um let's have a great conference
