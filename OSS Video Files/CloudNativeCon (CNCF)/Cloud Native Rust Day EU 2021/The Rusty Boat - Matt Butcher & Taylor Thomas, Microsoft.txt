The Rusty Boat - Matt Butcher & Taylor Thomas, Microsoft

One year ago, our team released Krustlet, a Kubernetes Kubelet implementation for running WASM modules written in Rust. Since then, we've spent plenty of time out on the frontier, implementing full Kubernetes functionality, all in Rust. In this session, we'll cover why we chose Rust and what the benefits and rough edges are. Using code from Krustlet as a practical backdrop, we'll show you how we wrote the core components of Kubelet from scratch and by leveraging various community crates (including gRPC, controllers, volume mounting, and more!) to highlight how you can also use Rust for your next Cloud Native project.
