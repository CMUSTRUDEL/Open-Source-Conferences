hey folks thank you so much for joining

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
us today for the first ever cloud native

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,319
rest day

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,160
my name is daniel mangum and i'm a

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,760
senior software engineer at outbound and

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,960
a member of the cloud native rest day

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
program committee

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
well there are lots of folks to thank

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,559
for participating in and putting on this

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
event

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,480
i want to start with a little bit of

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
background on how this event came to be

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
as sabri and chris mentioned in the

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,680
opening remarks cloud native rush day

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,880
really evolved from a single tweet from

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
sabri saying that

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,800
well this event should exist it's a

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,880
testament to the openness and

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,160
flexibility of folks at the cloud native

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
computing foundation

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,920
the russ foundation and all those who

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,520
work to make kubecon happen

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
this event could be launched on short

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,960
notice and become a kubecon

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,719
eu 2021 day zero event and that openness

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
and inclusivity is what i want to focus

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,079
on for these closing remarks

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
as you have likely seen today through

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
interactions in the chat and on the

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
event slack channel

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
both the cloud native and russ

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
communities are full of people who care

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
about each other

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
this is reflected in how documentation

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
is written knowledge is shared and

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
conversations are had

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,400
as evidenced by the many individuals and

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
organizations that presented today and

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
said that russ is becoming a key part of

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
their cloud-native story

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
these two communities are becoming more

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
and more intertwined

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,920
i cannot imagine any two more

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,840
like-minded groups joining forces

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
looking back at all the talks from today

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
i'm impressed by both the depth and

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,200
breadth of use cases of rust and cloud

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,119
native projects

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,360
while many folks identify russ is a

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,640
great language for embedded systems and

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,799
low-level programming

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
and this is certainly true we also saw

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
the usage of language features that

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,920
enhance programmer productivity

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
in situations where other languages have

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,079
historically been used

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
some of these include usage of macros to

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
deduplicate boilerplate code

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
leveraging the borrow checker to

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
eliminate race conditions and utilizing

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
generics and traits to produce powerful

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
abstractions

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
likewise we also saw how rush enables

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,759
programmers to produce safe and

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
performant systems

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
to regularly touted capabilities of the

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
language and how its interoperability

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
with webassembly

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
is helping to bring many projects to new

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,079
domains whether it be the browser

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,200
tiny iot sensors or elsewhere overall

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,800
this event has made me

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
and i'm sure countless others excited

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
about the future of rust and how it will

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
shape the cloud native ecosystem

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
before we finish out the day i would be

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
remiss if i didn't mention a few key

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
individuals who made this day possible

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,239
first and foremost

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
i wanted to extend a huge thank you to

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,200
elena vogel

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
elna has been orchestrating this event

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
from behind the scenes since day one

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
all organization communication and

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
scheduling is thanks to elna

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
and her colleagues at the cncf and this

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
is

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
possible without their efforts i also

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,280
want to thank chris and the members of

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,440
the program committee

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
following sabri's lead it was a true joy

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
to work alongside the program committee

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
to review cfp submissions

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
plan what the schedule looked like and

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
generally dream about how this event

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,200
could be most impactful for attendees

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,160
lastly thank you to all speakers and

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
attendees

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
communities are made up of people and i

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
hope that you know that you are a valued

00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
member of this community

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
whether you are an experienced first

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,680
station or just getting started

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
we are so thankful that you were able to

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
be part of this event and we look

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
forward to future cloud native rest days

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,159
in the coming years

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
i want to remind everyone that these

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
closing remarks are going to be followed

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
by a workshop by the wonderful folks at

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
ferris systems

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
this is an excellent opportunity for

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
folks who are new to russ to get started

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
and those who are experienced with the

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
language to help others with that

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,879
i hope everyone has an awesome week at

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
