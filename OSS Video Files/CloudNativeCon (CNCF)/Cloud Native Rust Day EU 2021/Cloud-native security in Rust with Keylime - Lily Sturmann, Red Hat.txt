Cloud-native security in Rust with Keylime - Lily Sturmann, Red Hat

Keylime is a CNCF hosted, open source project that provides a highly scalable remote boot attestation and runtime integrity measurement solution. In early 2021, the Keylime team is wrapping up porting a key component of Keylime, the remote node cryptographically proving its security, from Python to Rust. This session presents an overview of Keylime with a focus on Rust as natural fit for this cloud-native security project.
