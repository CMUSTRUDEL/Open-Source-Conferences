Lightning Talk: Streaming Video from WebXR content using Servo - Alan Jeffry, Servo Project

Servo is an embeddable web engine written in Rust, which for a long time was The Other Big Rust Program. One of the strengths of Servo is its ability to deliver immersive content using WebXR and WebGL. This talk introduces the Servo GStreamer plugin, which allows web content to be streamed to low-end devices, including streaming 360 video from WebXR content.
