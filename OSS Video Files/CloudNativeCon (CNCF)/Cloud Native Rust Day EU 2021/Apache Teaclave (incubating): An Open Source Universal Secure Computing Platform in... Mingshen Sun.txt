Apache Teaclave (incubating): An Open Source Universal Secure Computing Platform in Rust - Mingshen Sun, Baidu

Apache Teaclave (incubating) is a universal secure computing platform written in Rust, making computation on privacy-sensitive data on cloud safe and secure. Teaclave adopts multiple security technologies to enable secure computing, in particular, Teaclave is written in Rust to prevent memory-safety issues. It uses Intel SGX to serve the most security-sensitive tasks with hardware-based isolation, memory encryption and attestation. Teaclave is a function-as-a-service platform. With many built-in functions, it also supports a wide variety of tasks on sensitive data like privacy preserving machine learning, private set intersection, etc. Unlike traditional FaaS, Teaclave supports both general secure computing tasks and flexible single- and multi-party secure computation. In this talk, Mingshen will talk about the background, design and how Rust empowers Teaclave's implementation.
