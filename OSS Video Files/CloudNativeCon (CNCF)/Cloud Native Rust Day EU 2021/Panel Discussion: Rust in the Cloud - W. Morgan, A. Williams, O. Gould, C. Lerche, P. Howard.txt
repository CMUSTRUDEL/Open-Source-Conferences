Panel Discussion: Rust in the Cloud - Moderated by William Morgan, Buoyant; Ashely Williams, Rust Foundation; Oliver Gould, Buoyant; Carl Lerche, Amazon; Paul Howard, Arm

Speakers: Paul Howard, Ashley Williams, Oliver Gould, Carl Lerche
In this discussion, panelists from several areas in the intersection of the Rust and Cloud Native communities will discuss what's next for the Rust in the cloud. Questions will cover both social and community aspects (e.g. the parallels between cloud native and Rust community ethos), the technical (e.g. the introduction of async/await), and the subjective (e.g. is there anything else Rust needs in order to be successful in the cloud space?).
