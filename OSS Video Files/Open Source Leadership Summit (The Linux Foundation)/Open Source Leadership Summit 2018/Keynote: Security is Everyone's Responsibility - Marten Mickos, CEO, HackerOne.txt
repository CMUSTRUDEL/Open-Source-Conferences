Description: 
	Keynote: Security is Everyone's Responsibility - Marten Mickos, CEO, HackerOne

 Cybersecurity is a $100 billion market that's wasting resources and frustrating customers with inadequate protection. We need security designed into products, not applied on top of them. We need ubiquitous security, not just on the perimeter. We need openness and collaboration. And we need to make security the responsibility of everyone, not just the CISO and their team. If we don't learn from the breaches of the past, they will continue to increase in size and frequency, slowing down society, harming companies and consumers. In this talk, Marten Mickos presents a vision for a world where everyone is diligent about cybersecurity and thereby the total cost of it goes down, not up.

	00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,490
good morning everybody how many of you

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:11,429
are having your day job a responsibility

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,870
for cybersecurity or just security or

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,930
just cyber okay any of those any of this

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,230
so maybe cyber you never know you never

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,060
know oh this is open source and how many

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,470
of you don't have any security

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,369
responsibilities in your daily work all

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,020
the rest should now raise their hands

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,940
something is wrong here something is

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,670
amiss I have a simple point today so I

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,920
could stop after the title slide

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,700
security is everybody's responsibility

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,280
and if you do security today you must

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,399
stop being so inwards focused and open

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,170
up and bring others into security and if

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,180
you are not doing security today you

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,219
need to start doing it because you're

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,579
not in software if you're not in

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,390
security if you go and visit somebody in

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:07,560
a hospital who is in charge for fighting

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,450
contamination you you wash your hands

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,180
you disinfect your hands everybody does

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,560
it you may not own the hospital you're

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,630
not the doctor you're not the nurse

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,810
you're not the patient but you are in

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,299
charge of the security of the hospital

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,560
meaning keeping viruses away and

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,570
bacteria and and many of us here we have

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,340
happily been developing open source the

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,290
other piece of software for decades and

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,159
we're so proud of the millions of

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,680
installations we have but I invite you

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,430
to do like I do and repent and fix this

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,610
thing because what we built for fun is

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,280
now used for the most critical parts of

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,890
society and we can't just keep doing it

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,350
the way we did we have to build security

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,329
into all the fun stuff that we kept

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,329
building over the past several decades

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:05,100
so yes so that's that's me on the left

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,799
I'm CEO of hacker one we we try to bring

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,649
open source philosophies into the area

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,849
of security we call ourselves a hacker

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,120
power security company we have a hundred

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:20,099
60,000 contributors security researchers

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,810
ethical hackers white hats have signed

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:27,510
up to find flaws in your software to

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,739
find vulnerabilities that software bugs

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,110
with it's more than software bugs

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,720
security vulnerabilities can emanate

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,090
from situations without any bug but when

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,940
there's a security vulnerability in this

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,739
system we will find it we hacked the

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,480
airforce it took us eight minutes to

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,549
break in

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,160
we found 200 vulnerabilities in the air

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,980
force's systems 20 of those were found

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,370
by jack cable a 17 year old high school

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,790
student from chicago illinois these are

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,269
the hackers that work with us and for us

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,060
as volunteers and freelancers to to find

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,540
the vulnerabilities but we need you to

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,900
fix them somebody also must fix the code

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,150
there so in the history of the hacker

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,540
one company our customers have been

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,069
found and our customers have fixed over

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,880
65,000 security vulnerabilities to date

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:23,220
so that has removed a lot of holes where

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,769
criminals could have entered hasn't

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,260
removed all the holes there are I don't

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,060
even know how many tens of millions

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,069
hundreds of millions a billion who knows

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,349
how many vulnerabilities there are in

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,480
the joint attack surface of the world

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,310
but if we deploy a hundred billion lines

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,989
of code every year new lines of code

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,760
there's a lot of security to look after

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,349
we operate a nonprofit that supports

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,239
open source projects who can't afford

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,949
this themselves it's called the internet

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,560
bug bounty so feel free to check it out

00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,419
and we publish vulnerability reports for

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,900
the whole world so go to activity and

00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,780
read the reports and learn in what ways

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,190
software can be can have security

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,650
vulnerabilities cyber security or

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,849
security or whatever you call it if you

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,639
don't know it you just call it cyber

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:15,150
it's a hundred billion dollar market

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,650
today 100 billion dollars is spent on

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,890
cyber security and in this business we

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,409
call it or some of us say cyber security

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,360
is the new marketing half of the money

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:32,129
is wasted we just don't know we

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,889
have we've been buying hardware and

00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:37,409
software and machines and walls and all

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,080
kinds of stuff thinking that that

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:43,860
technology and product will make us

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,590
secure but that's not true

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,689
it isn't security it doesn't make you

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,669
any more secure if you buy more Hardware

00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,800
if you pile up Hardware around your

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,159
company and you have a perimeter doesn't

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,009
make you more secure but yet the world

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,620
is spending 100 billion a year trying to

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:06,539
get more secure by by doing all these

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,849
things the the answer is is much more

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:12,409
simple and much more boring and

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:16,439
unpleasant because this is security

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:18,449
security is when you share you share the

00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,389
defence you share information you work

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,939
together you can't be secure if just

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,219
some are secure and others are not you

00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,229
can't have secure software if just some

00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,949
of your software engineers are in charge

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,620
of security

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,139
you can't just delegate it or relegate

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,199
it to a security team if you do that it

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,240
won't happen it's the same as in the 90s

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,550
when everybody had a quality manager or

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,589
quality VP of quality or something and

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,469
everybody got their ISO certifications

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,180
it didn't help it reduced quality in the

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:50,159
companies because people felt that

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,159
quality now was the job of somebody else

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,990
none of you some things are so important

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:58,409
that you cannot give them to just one

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,360
team or one group and security is a

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,879
discipline it's doing it every single

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,069
time if you go and visit your friend in

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,839
the hospital you better wash your hands

00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,930
and disinfect them every single time you

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,879
go in and when you come out and it's not

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,250
about how many times you did it it's

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,490
making sure that you never failed to do

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,039
it so that's hard for all of us who are

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,689
a little bit sloppy and we would like to

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,000
be secure but we don't always pay

00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:27,050
attention to it and fortunately software

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,300
security only happens when we're very

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,080
disciplined and I'll go into more

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,020
details about this specifically when we

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,899
say shared we often talk about cyber

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,920
threats being a symmetric in the sense

00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,100
that

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,020
one single criminal attacker one single

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,370
malicious attacker can cause a lot of

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,100
harm so much harm that you need a

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,890
hundred people to defend and it's nearly

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,140
all over always like this in crime one

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,090
bad guy will need a hundred good guys to

00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,680
stop that bad guy and then we say oh

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,070
it's an asymmetric threat and there's

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,960
nothing we can do because they're they

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,610
don't need as many people as we do but

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,340
there is a cure to this and that's

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,350
pooled defense because the number of

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,020
defenders is far larger than the number

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,610
of bad guys there are far more white

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,950
hats in the world and there are black

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,840
hats and when I said we have a hundred

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,240
sixty thousand hackers signed up at hack

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,980
one we already have more people signed

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,980
up with our service than there are black

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,900
hats in the world so if companies can

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,810
get together and pull the defense you

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,030
turn the asymmetry around and suddenly

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,030
you have ten times the power of the

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,430
attackers still the every single attack

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,260
is an asymmetric threat to you but if

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,280
you share information share the defense

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,980
share best practices and share the the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,870
act of of responding to threats then you

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:54,720
overcome the asymmetry you turn it

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:57,000
around and the discipline and diligence

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,060
it unfortunately

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,450
the devil is in the detail everybody

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,730
talks about Equifax and it's a very sad

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,580
story and we can probably note that that

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:11,280
company has so many failures and and

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,680
acts of negligence or sort of omissions

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,390
in their the way they handle the

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,880
security and all of this bad stuff

00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,950
happen is just getting worse but think

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,960
about it it was one single software

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,720
vulnerability that led to the data

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,590
breach in their system one single

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,230
vulnerability

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,390
there's nobody here who has a software

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,260
system with just one vulnerability all

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,580
of you have a system with many just your

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,729
smartphone or your laptop or your

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:42,890
company systems so this shows that you

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:46,010
have to be very diligent and have the

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,970
commitment to take care of every single

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,820
vulnerability because you never know

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,830
where they might attack of course you

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,810
start with the most severe ones and then

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,880
you end by

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,460
by fixing the easy ones that's how you

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,160
keep the risk down but but there's no

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,870
way around this so many times in

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,670
cybersecurity we complain about long

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,529
passwords we complain about multi-factor

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,160
authentication this is taking too much

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:12,920
time guys get used to it it doesn't

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,589
secure it it doesn't come for free the

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,750
only thing that goes acts against these

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,670
threats is the discipline and diligence

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,470
remembering long passwords or whatever

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,180
it is even when somebody invents a

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,490
method where we don't be mean passwords

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,440
anymore you will be asked to do

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,570
something else which is burdensome and

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,330
everyday and where you are not allowed

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,820
to miss it one single time just like

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,220
seatbelts we were seatbelts all the time

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,770
and it takes just one act of not wearing

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,620
a seatbelt and it's bad it's the same

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,210
here and we just have haven't agreed or

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,990
we have refused to acknowledge that it's

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:50,089
the same with with cybersecurity and

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,730
then we have to be so fast because

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,010
whatever happens the bad guys are fast

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,290
so you have to be a little bit faster

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,770
and Jim talked about how can we make

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,870
this cycle spin faster one of the big

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,230
big problems of software today is that

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:09,140
the update cycle is too slow

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,450
we had severe vulnerability reported

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,160
through our service to an online service

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,980
that's very very popular among all of

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,930
you it was reported on Friday afternoon

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,310
and they fixed it in six hours so they

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,500
receive a message saying here's

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,050
something I think this is severe they

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,089
read it within 30 minutes I said yes

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,820
this is very severe let's start working

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,040
on it they figured out how to fix it in

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,630
the next few hours they tested it they

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,300
rolled out the patch everything done

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:42,610
within six hours and the faster you can

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,920
act the lower your risk for any

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,560
incidents and it's all about acting fast

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,970
and jokingly you don't have to be fast

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,120
you just have to be faster than your

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,740
competitors because criminals are lazy

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,570
and they go for the low-hanging fruit

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,029
they go for the companies that have the

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,980
weakest defense so if you are known to

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,900
have a strong defense then they are less

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,760
likely to try of course they will still

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,470
try but they're a little bit less likely

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,320
so acting without delay and acting

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,660
without delay of course if a security

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,870
incident truly happens then rule number

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,990
one is don't freak out don't freak out

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,560
we just did a Red Team exercise inside

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,440
our company where few people staged a

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,100
very bad attack on hacker 1 and we had

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,840
so many people freaking out so finally

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,790
they say ok we must call our external

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,040
counsel and report this because this has

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,740
to be reported to the authorities and at

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,830
that point we call the exercise often

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,750
said it it was just an Red Team exercise

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,210
this time but it's good to do it I

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,250
didn't know about it I was I was not

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,780
aware that we were doing it but but it's

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,210
a very good way of testing whether you

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,090
freak out or not when when things really

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,670
go bad so response efficiency is key and

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,470
also being knowing what to do so when

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,990
you plan for cyber security you need to

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,540
plan for what happens when something

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,670
happens so first if you do all the

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,070
preventative work that's a lot of work

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,140
then you plan for the moment when an

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,880
incident really occurs so you need to

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,470
have that plan ready and then thirdly

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,180
you need to have an applied ready for

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,250
what you do afterwards how do you clean

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,250
up afterwards so a lot of work to do

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,770
after an incident has happened as well

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,810
and it needs to be security needs to be

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,020
embedded in everything we do

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:30,560
it just has to airline security airline

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,520
safety is now like that airlines are

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,070
probably the safest way of

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,860
transportation safer than walking in San

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,750
Francisco and it is because they've

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,420
embedded it in everything they do

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,800
you cannot build an airplane or an

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,320
engine or a wheel or anything a bolt for

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,300
a screw or any small little piece for an

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,370
airplane without having it tested and

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,130
approved and everybody who works there

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,440
will think about safety every day they

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,710
share everything with competitors and

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,280
they've embedded safety in everything

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:07,410
Airlines and their ports and aircraft do

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,050
and that's why it is so safe we just

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,500
haven't done it in software yet this is

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,970
a juvenile industry compared to to the

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,339
airline industry but then there was a

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,830
time when flying was very dangerous

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,270
it is not anymore so if there was a time

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,279
when software was very danger

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,080
like now there will come a time when

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,050
it's not dangerous anymore we will

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,500
figure this out but it will require

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:34,050
embedding it in everything we do

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,660
so in summary here are things we must do

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,320
you are many of you are already doing it

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:43,020
some partly preaching to the choir here

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,810
but we must democratize security we must

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,910
make cybersecurity a topic for everybody

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,410
a small topic for everybody not a big

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,240
one there will be expert we will need

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,830
see service and security architects and

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,520
all these people they are not going away

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,380
but they must be inclusive in what they

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,180
do they must bring in everybody into

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,550
network and everybody must feel a

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,000
responsibility for it just like we feel

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,370
responsibility for hygiene when we go to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,990
a hospital or we accept the security

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,370
checkpoints at the airport all of these

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,520
things that we do every day without

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,980
thinking we use seat belts in cars we do

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,170
many things now that originally felt

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,660
cumbersome and clunky and difficult and

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,700
now we say yeah it's the cost of living

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,300
it's a cost of being a human being so

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,709
you must democratize it number two those

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,839
are not in open-source need to learn

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,660
from open source open source has built

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,149
an amazing functionality for people to

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,329
work together and specifically for

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,560
people who disagree to work together

00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:43,589
that's perhaps the best accomplishment

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,880
of open-source ever I have never found

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:49,589
two open source people who would agree

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,600
on anything yet it works so you build

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,089
the governance of how to resolve

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,070
conflict how to vote how to decide which

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,959
feature to do whether it's quality or

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,300
shipment time or what matters and

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,860
building this ability for conflict

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,870
resolution is is one of the great

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,270
accomplishments of of open source and

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,860
then with that goes the transparency you

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,790
can't do that if you're not transparent

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,790
you need to share

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,310
we need to legislate cyber hygiene this

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,740
is a message for Congress and

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,480
parliaments in other countries when it's

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,730
a shared responsibility like this it

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,940
won't happen if our elected legislators

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,699
don't state so in a law and we have no

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,450
law today that would really mandate

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,040
companies to take care of this

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,490
it's finally happening I think I don't

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,620
know how fast those those wheels rotate

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,200
they weren't on James slide it can take

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,389
years but it's important that we set the

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,560
standard that nobody can avoid and

00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:54,070
nobody can can stay away from and then

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,199
with software we need to be able to fix

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,279
software and if software cannot be

00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:02,170
patched or fixed then deprecated stop

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,680
living and working with software that

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,940
isn't designed for this connected world

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,310
with so much software that was designed

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,560
before the internet or that assume that

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,870
not everybody could connect it today

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,240
everything is connected the software

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,829
can't handle it if you can't roll out

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,600
roll out the patch when you find the

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,139
security vulnerability then deprecated

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,760
the whole thing we did that in y2k we

00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,260
took out all software couldn't handle

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,870
modern dates we should do the same with

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,209
with security and software just take it

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,529
out it's expensive it's painful it's

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:35,170
difficult you will say it's impossible

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,720
yeah I have heard all of those it's not

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:41,740
true it is possible the world has to go

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,990
on and then as as a message to our

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,430
educational institutions don't call it

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,089
computer science and software

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,640
engineering

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,279
unless there's security in it today you

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,220
can graduate in CS without taking a

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,470
single course in security you don't have

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,870
to pay any attention to security and I

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,940
certainly didn't when I took my degree a

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,100
long time ago but now we must change it

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,069
it has to become part of everything we

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,530
do and when we do all of this the ship

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,079
will turn it's a big ship so turn slowly

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,600
but it will turn and we will get to a

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,660
state that is similar to what we have

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,559
with airline safety or hospital hygiene

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:23,410
or car automotive safety where today it

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,750
all works but it works because we do it

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:30,630
together and we jointly take

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,630
responsibility for it thank you

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,040
so I I couldn't agree more obviously

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,050
it's one of the reasons you're here but

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,550
you know one of the things that is

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,230
happening this week and I want to

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,150
encourage people is I think you're so

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,470
right in that there's not any single

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,270
solution it is a collective

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,850
responsibility I'll give you a couple of

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,580
examples that are happy on this week

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,410
SP DX is an initiative that we've been

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,450
working on for a long time at the Linux

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,250
Foundation in order to understand a

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,340
software bill of materials this was

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,560
largely for license compliance but to

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,570
your point if you don't know what

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,220
software you're actually running if you

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,570
don't have an easy way for an upstream

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,610
supplier to provide that to their

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,930
downstream supply chain how are you

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,000
gonna fix anything right you don't

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,170
deserve no right sir so these are things

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,110
you see how these things start to

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,270
interconnect to Martin's point which if

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,310
we all think of and take responsibility

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,110
and create this culture of like hey I've

00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,610
got a different way of trying to solve

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,260
that same problem we're all gonna have

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,820
better outcomes so I love the

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,720
perspective thank you so much thank you

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,289
thanks

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,289
