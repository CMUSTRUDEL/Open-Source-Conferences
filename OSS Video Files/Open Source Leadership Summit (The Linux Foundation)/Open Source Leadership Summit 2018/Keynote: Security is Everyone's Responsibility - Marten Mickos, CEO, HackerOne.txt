	Keynote: Security is Everyone's Responsibility - Marten Mickos, CEO, HackerOne

 Cybersecurity is a $100 billion market that's wasting resources and frustrating customers with inadequate protection. We need security designed into products, not applied on top of them. We need ubiquitous security, not just on the perimeter. We need openness and collaboration. And we need to make security the responsibility of everyone, not just the CISO and their team. If we don't learn from the breaches of the past, they will continue to increase in size and frequency, slowing down society, harming companies and consumers. In this talk, Marten Mickos presents a vision for a world where everyone is diligent about cybersecurity and thereby the total cost of it goes down, not up.
