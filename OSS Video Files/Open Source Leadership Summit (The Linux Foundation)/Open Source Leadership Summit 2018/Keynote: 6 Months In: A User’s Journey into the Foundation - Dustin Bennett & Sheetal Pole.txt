	Keynote: 6 Months In: A User’s Journey into the Foundation - Dustin Bennett, Software Engineer Sr. Manager & Sheetal Pole, Software Engineer Manager, The Home Depot 

As one of the largest Cloud Foundry end users, The Home Depot has a diverse array of applications serving its website, stores, and internal operations. In October 2017, the world's largest home improvement retailer joined the Cloud Foundry Foundation as a gold member. Sheetal and Dustin will present on the initial strategy, successes, and lessons learned as the company has on-boarded with the Foundation. They will discuss the benefits realized as a Foundation member and the impact that contributing back to the community has had on the company.

hey everybody MC the bull I'm an

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,379
engineering manager at the Home Depot I

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,210
work in the store systems team where we

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,010
build and support the software that our

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,049
Home Depot associates use and the two

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,650
thousand plus stores we have across the

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,380
country and I'm Dustin Bennett I'm a

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,910
manager of several teams at Home Depot

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,699
including we kind of consider our

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,640
software engineer enablement function so

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,920
we've got application platforms legacy

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,920
and cloud as well as developer tools

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,420
github artifactory those kinds of things

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,880
and a bunch of kitchen sink stuff as

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,350
you'll find in any enterprise so that

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,090
was a great intro I appreciate that I

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,620
usually like opening by asking the

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,219
question how many people are planning a

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,660
Home Depot run this weekend ok for those

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,059
of you who are hands are still down

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,039
there's a nonzero chance that something

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,980
breaks and you play the game where I

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,440
need a new one of these right so you

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,660
know I say that because you know to the

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,370
earlier point most people think of Home

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,949
Depot they think of the stores the

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,320
sights sounds and smells you know that

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,290
warms a paren the forklifts and cherry

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,240
pickers beeping the you know blending of

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,500
smells from sawdust to key cutting to

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,080
paint and everything else in the store

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,330
and sure Home Depot is a retailer first

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,770
and foremost but you know we do these

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,020
kinds of things to show that Home Depot

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,150
is also a technology company which is

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,490
you know almost as important for us

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,520
these days so what we're going to talk

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,140
about today is you know our foray into

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,579
cloud foundry and some open and inter

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,549
source initiatives we have at Home Depot

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,560
we started really in earnest about six

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,570
months ago and you know we're pretty

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,210
ambitious we're pretty proactive our

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,310
goal was to leap in jump in as quickly

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,729
as we can ended up being a little bit

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,200
more tentative waiting unfortunately but

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,520
you know we're here to share kind of

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,399
what we've been through some lessons

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,909
learned some good and bad and whatnot so

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,700
where we'll go and where we'll start

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:59,100
I'll talk about our foray into the cloud

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,540
foundry foundation specifically and then

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,369
we'll turn it over to Sheetal to talk

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,070
about some open source and enter source

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,840
initiatives at Home Depot

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:11,129
but first Sheetal talked a little bit

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,250
about why we're doing this in general so

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,780
our customers right we always

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,210
like to contextualise whatever we do in

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,380
terms of our customers it could be you

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,270
know folks like you walk into the

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,830
brick-and-mortar stores to pick up

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,990
home-improvement items it could be

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,970
looking at paint items on our Home Depot

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,570
app or shopping at Home Depot calm

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,220
website so we believe that you know

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,040
providing the most seamless and

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,360
frictionless experience for our

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,890
customers but also our store associates

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
because I I work in the team that builds

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,600
the application for our store associates

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,520
we feel like moving towards open source

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,890
whether it's using or contributing back

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,860
can only help us improve it right yeah

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,910
code reuse improving code quality

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,980
decreasing time to market I think are

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,510
all things that we get when when we get

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:58,610
closer into the open source world along

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,410
with the customer focus one of the

00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,380
things Home Depot is very proud of is

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,030
its culture and its core values what you

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,730
see up here is what we call the values

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,340
wheel these are eight anchoring values

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,200
that have been around ever since Home

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,470
Depot was founded by Arthur Blank and

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,700
Bernie Marcus back in the day

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,470
contributing to open source directly

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,000
ties back to one of our values which is

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,470
giving back right giving back to the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,519
community being part of the larger

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,590
ecosystem I think it makes sense to to a

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,590
lot of our stake holders in Home Depot

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,600
okay so we'll jump into a little bit

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,209
about how we strategically approached

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,010
our contributions back to Cloud Foundry

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,410
so the show of hands it who's familiar

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,850
with Cloud Foundry okay that's a lot

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,260
bigger than my normal audience I did

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,769
this in a github event and it was almost

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,650
zero

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,950
so I'll just just briefly overview for

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,739
those who who kept their hands down

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,360
Cloud Foundry is an open source pass

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,370
it's managed by the Cloud Foundry

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,890
foundation holds the core source code

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,560
it's typically resold and packaged by

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:08,630
vendors and sold to end-users like

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,790
ourselves so we use pivotal version of

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,730
Cloud Foundry as our end product for

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,120
most of our paths cloud top plot cloud

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,910
platform deployments it's a very complex

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,810
landscape so if you look at cloud

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,570
foundry itself

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,000
yes it's generally one open-source

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,200
project but really there's 30 or 40

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,110
orchestrated application

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,210
Asians that build the paths and anybody

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,560
who's run or deployed apps and paths can

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,720
imagine you know there's a lot of

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,610
complexity from container orchestration

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,580
to scheduling to keeping things alive to

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,210
moving droplets around etc etc so it's a

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,400
pretty complicated landscape we joined

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,330
the Cloud Foundry foundation back in

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,210
October as an end user so part of that

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,210
was an expectation that we would give

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,300
back meaningfully to the Cloud Foundry

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,440
foundation in terms of code commits so

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,660
we had to play a little bit of catch-up

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,130
because I was a little bit surprised

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,140
when we pitched to join and it was

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,280
approved so we had to come up with the

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,110
the strategy of how we're gonna

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,530
functionally contribute in a meaningful

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,050
way that's beneficial to both us and the

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,570
community at large so we did a little

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,750
bit of brainstorming more recently we

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,580
have our chief architect Barbara Sanders

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,040
was elected to the Cloud Foundry Board

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,750
of Directors I'm an ambassador for cloud

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,550
foundry on the board staff which I'm

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,610
just means I have a lot more homework

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,880
now I don't really know but we wanted to

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,410
give back so how did how do we do this

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,950
I'll take a little bit of a divergence

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,320
here we have an office that's co-located

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,060
at Georgia Tech's campus in Atlanta in

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,000
Midtown Atlanta that we staffed with

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,710
interns throughout the year typically we

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,110
have more over the summer but we we

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,780
staff throughout the term so what our

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,670
approach was is and we keep our

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,040
operations team for our Cloud Foundry

00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,660
platform pretty lean you know it's

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,580
roughly three pairs at any given time

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,700
two to three pairs operating the

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,340
platform so what we wanted to do is we

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,830
put together a pitch of taking an intern

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,840
pair out of the Georgia Tech office

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,760
giving them a fairly open-ended problem

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,590
of you know generally just get a pull

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,930
request approved into the end of the

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,490
code base and see where they took it and

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,040
ran with it

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,590
we were pretty fortunate to get some a

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,170
couple rock star interns Thomas Olsen

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,490
and Madeline Goebbels who have really

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,800
hit the ground running with this they

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,300
started in December which meant there

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,060
was a little bit of lag due to the

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,220
holidays around there but they've had at

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,810
least two or three pull requests

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,729
approved so far which was kind of a

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,150
reach goal for me starting this

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,860
have been in documentation but that's

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,699
not to say we were without pain points

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,289
as we went along so what we ran into you

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,969
know we've heard several people

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,580
mentioned throughout talks here is

00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,990
getting the corporate CLA sign frankly

00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,279
it that wasn't as painful as I might

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,559
have expected it took us about a week

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,539
but we did have to chase down you know a

00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:04,219
couple different VPS and corporate

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,809
counsel and that kind of thing so it was

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:08,689
a little bit longer than we wanted

00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:10,279
however we were able to contribute on

00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,639
individual licenses in the interim with

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,009
no problem another big problem was

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,149
environments unfortunately our intern

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:22,039
office for some orange tape reason could

00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,930
not get issued MacBooks which all of our

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,520
operations team has MacBooks so we had

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,559
to deal with a lot of the imaging and

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,889
getting things just building and running

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:33,889
there and then documentation so there's

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:37,430
a lot of coming in relatively fresh to a

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,439
project or a suite of github projects

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,330
like Cloud Foundry there's a lot of

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,949
documentation to wade through that some

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,360
of its up-to-date some of its accurate

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,889
and accurate with the latest build so

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,139
waiting through that and one of the

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,839
first initiatives that Thomas and

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,930
Madeline took on was to basically build

00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,060
a Home Depot playbook for this is what

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,339
the Cloud Foundry documentation means to

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,379
us at Home Depot as platform operators

00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,629
and this is what's important to us and

00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:06,349
how to ramp up into contributing to open

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,939
source and then finally what to work on

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,379
right because like I said there are 30

00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,779
or 40 projects we wanted to make sure

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,159
that you know our interns were fully

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,659
engaged because one of our main goals

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,909
through that program is to eventually

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,669
have full-time hires once they come out

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,309
of school so we wanted something that

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,809
was interesting to them and ambitious

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,689
but not too ambitious that they wouldn't

00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:29,749
be able to get it done within a semester

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:32,240
so where we landed there's a cloud

00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,190
controller API which is a bit at the

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,139
boundary of the system it's it's the

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,120
kind of the end API that we use and

00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:40,639
leverage pretty thoroughly to get

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,860
information and metadata of applications

00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,170
users that kind of thing so we have some

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,779
couple specific pull requests that we

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,819
want to implement that will help us as a

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,800
company that currently aren't

00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:52,880
prioritized in the product backlog

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,920
either with

00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,470
you know the open-source community or at

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,390
pivotal specifically we also want to

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,730
make sure that we tests our hypothesis

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,770
and iterate so not only on the code that

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,280
we're contributing but is this program

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,440
overall good for the Home Depot are we

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,730
realizing any value is this good for the

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,890
folks that are working on it is it good

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,630
for us as a company you know and we

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,700
always try to iterate and improve going

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,970
forward from there so your best case

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,860
scenario if this is very successful we

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,120
either expand the intern team or have

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,350
been talking to a number of folks here

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,960
about the way that they've built out

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,910
open-source program offices you know

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,680
that's another option depending on the

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,180
extent to which this is successful and

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,050
meaningful for the Home Depot and the

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,700
Foundation and then finally we'll be

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,350
presenting at Cloud Foundry summit and

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,600
Madeline who's the senior intern on the

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,240
team will be coming up to talk at user

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,770
days with us and we'll basically do a

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,960
similar kind of run through and talk

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,880
that we do here so that's kind of an

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,790
overview of our approach and strategy

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,200
for how we've gotten into the the Cloud

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,120
Foundry community I'm gonna turn it over

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,780
to Sheetal here to talk about open it

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,570
and resourcing Home Depot thanks Justin

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,270
so open source our usage of open source

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,070
often source software at Home Depot over

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,220
the last few years has gone up

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,360
drastically and part of it is this large

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,550
community of people are contributing

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,040
such great code that we can pick up and

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,020
use so obviously what's the first

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,390
motivation for open source it's free

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,980
code free code right it's we have a

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,470
large community supporting that codebase

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,690
it's something we can start off right

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,830
off the bat focus on a business features

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,900
without having to worry about some of

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,760
the on an AI underlying plumbing that

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:40,220
has been provided for us so apart from

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,140
the Cloud Foundry work that Dustin

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,210
mentioned we've also recently started

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,200
starting to figure out what giving back

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,760
means we've we have a CI deployment

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,040
codebase called flow that we recently

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,290
open source and which kind of leads into

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,880
that the second point of open source

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,130
software and using it and contributing

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,560
back is better code right having a more

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,930
diverse set of folks taking a look at

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,510
our code base you know

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,810
feedback getting any kind of full

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,180
request we're learning a lot from that

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,070
and I think that that's kind of into the

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,020
the biggest part of open sourcing our

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,910
software so we we've had a lot of

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,550
internal frameworks and tools that we've

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,680
traditionally used at Home Depot but I

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,420
think the the market scrutiny that we

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,910
get by being part of the open source

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,440
community is you know are we getting

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,210
enough attention are we getting pull

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,610
request is there a better tool out there

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,830
that's up on the rise is there a trend

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,960
that we should follow so there's a lot

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,090
of benefits that we're getting from just

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,800
being part of the community and again

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,140
we're making baby steps along our

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,090
contributions to open source but the

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,430
fact that been using more tools from the

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,040
open source market also reflects on you

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,260
know the fact that we want to be we get

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:58,370
it we realize the opportunities out

00:11:51,260 --> 00:12:00,140
there learning from the same model and

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,340
applying those internally so I would

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,190
personally work with multiple

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,310
development teams within Home Depot and

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,310
as is true of any large organization we

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,350
have competing priorities changing a

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,280
business needs a lot of realignments

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,560
that happen and part of what we've done

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,420
recently is within within our internal

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,740
github hosting right we we've we've

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,850
started adopting to some of these

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,350
open-source principles what did what had

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,260
taught that has given us recently is

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,520
just this just this constant realignment

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,210
that happens we get autonomous

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,790
prioritization so as an example recently

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,560
we had one feature request for one of my

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,090
teams which is pretty low on the list of

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,940
priorities we would implement for that

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,090
quarter but it was we apply for another

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,400
initiative another project so in a pure

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,140
open-source world right the the other

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,510
team created a pull request

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,970
you know they contributed to our source

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,340
code we accepted the pull requests in

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,050
the process they got to implement the

00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,180
feature in the timeline they needed and

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,100
we ended up with better documentation

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,260
better code coverage and obviously

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:11,270
better just a better code quality at the

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,190
end of the whole thing what we also

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,920
realized is when a team is inside a

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,079
source code into

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,820
could be a stain and day out the way

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,459
they look at the documentation and their

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,860
test coverage and and some of the other

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,110
ways in that code is a little different

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,850
than an outsider team who takes a look

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,170
at it so we've just over at the time we

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,600
are letting others who are code reviews

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,250
and in the process we have better read

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,570
Me's and our github repos I think that's

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:43,269
one of the best things out of our inner

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:47,680
source so we are continually improving

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:49,899
collectively within Home Depot and we've

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,730
seen some great benefits out of it we've

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,260
also learned a lot from the open source

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,720
community we've realized some of the

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,670
lessons learned over the years

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,250
internally how to apply those having a

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,209
community leader having coordination

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,470
within the leadership good documentation

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,570
you know a lot of the principles that

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,880
that apply to a successful open source

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,380
project we've starting to learn how to

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,070
adopt those internally and externally

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,959
when we contribute back now and we

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,120
personally have learnt a lot over

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,100
yesterday's sessions and talking to a

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,680
lot of folks who are part of the open

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,750
source community and will take back

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,390
these lessons and hopefully come back

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,680
with a better picture with that with

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,720
that waiting into the water picture you

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,529
had Dustin yeah maybe we can start

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,810
jumping yeah yeah so I think you know

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,000
just another thing on on our open source

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,820
and inner source model outside of the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,500
value that it brings us to as a company

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,839
and the value that we can bring back

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,390
into the community it's you know

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,949
customers are our top priority and our

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,560
customer service and customer experience

00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:57,399
you know is above all else as Sheetal

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,050
mentioned earlier but second you know

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,880
close second to that as our associates

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,709
so you know typically we think of that

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,779
as our frontline associates who are in

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,970
stores in the orange aprons but that's

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,350
also our software engineers and software

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,209
development teams and technology

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,339
deployment teams who are writing code

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,860
that runs on the point-of-sale registers

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:17,019
on the website on the stores and the

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,540
engineers that we have on staff and the

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,220
engineers that we want to recruit want

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,290
to contribute to open source they're

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,899
either already involved in open source

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,350
projects they're used to using it so

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,030
we're seeing you know a big

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,700
take in the software engineering

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,620
community that were you know we were

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,720
both cultivating internally and looking

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,610
to our externally this is something that

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,220
they want to be doing right so it's a

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,470
competitive advantage for us to be able

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,930
to say yes the Home Depot is proactive

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,430
at contributing back to open source if

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,410
you want to get involved with a project
