Description: 
	Keynote: Realizing the Full Potential of NOAA’s Open Data - Edward Kearns, Chief Data Officer, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been a government leader in Open Data for many decades. NOAA’s science-based mission includes, for example, the protection of life and property from weather events, the regulation of marine fisheries in a sustainable manner, the monitoring of climate change,  the protection of marine mammals, and the long-term preservation of environmental information. In the course of achieving this mission, NOAA collects, analyzes, synthesizes and distributes many petabytes of data every year, and NOAA has realized the potential value of these data when shared in a full and open manner, with no restrictions on others’ use of these taxpayer-funded data. NOAA’s mission benefits from enabling scientific research in the academic community that ultimately improves NOAA’s products and services to the Nation. The US economy benefits from the jobs created by industry through the provision, interpretation and integration of NOAA open data into a variety of value-added products and services.  And our global society benefits through the sharing of these open data which are used by governments and industries alike to evaluate and respond to risks from environmental events such as extreme weather, rising sea levels, threats to food supplies, droughts and floods.  A brief history of Open Data in NOAA will be discussed, and a new initiative to realize their full potential through Partnerships that promote the wider use of these data will be described.

thanks for having me yes I am honored to

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,450
be Noah's actually first-ever chief data

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,360
officer which means I'm a scientist and

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,590
a bureaucrat and it's a position that I

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,150
started last year it's a new in

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,859
government to adopt these kinds of that

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,390
kind of structure so since I'm a little

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,410
a little bit different than maybe some

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,859
of your other speakers just a little

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,500
interest type stuff here you know again

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,779
a science background use technology to

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,690
accomplish the science gosh I started

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,860
using UNIX probably back in 1987 free

00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:38,370
Linux you know that I actually started

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,070
using it still date myself right here on

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,260
a VAX VMs machine using a UNIX emulator

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,469
called unis some of you out there will

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,289
remember that godforsaken product but it

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,050
got me into the into the right crew you

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,660
know and I had a colleague back at the

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,160
time who had had told me locate as a

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,680
earth scientist people are gonna tell

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,140
you to learn Fortran and learn VMs and

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,850
he said no no learn Unix and learn C and

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,310
those were that was a great advice

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,170
yes so uh how many of you heard of Nilla

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,830
before is the government agency that is

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,049
wonderful

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,780
okay our brand recognition isn't quite

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,729
as good as NASA's but and we've done the

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,320
studies just point that out so that's

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,030
okay but we have an operational mission

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,130
it's science-based like NASA's but

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,159
NASA's mission is research our our

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,020
mission is operations to get the the

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,000
quality information to the American

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,619
people that they need to run their

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,060
businesses to protect their lives and

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,090
property to manage their water resources

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,470
to manage their ocean resources and we

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,659
take this mission very very seriously

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,670
we've got twenty twelve thousand people

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,200
a better that are working this mission

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,530
right now about seven thousand them are

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,180
scientists federal employees and in our

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,790
mission statement I've circled it here

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,710
our mission is to share that information

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,659
all right so that's very important we

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,060
don't hoard the information we try to

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,790
get it out to others and we've been

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,369
doing big data since before that the

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,990
term was coined right so part and parcel

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,210
to doing oceanography as I am I'm an

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,469
oceanographer or meteorology is you're

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,509
dealing with large quantities of

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,890
observations that you're trying to glean

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,970
some kind of insight about how the

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,330
environment works all right and it's

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,910
it's inherently a difficult problem

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,010
we've got we've got way too much data

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,350
we've got about 30 petabytes right now

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,700
that's that's in our archives we have

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,620
another about 200 petabytes of data

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,330
that's sort of in our working working

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,460
data store within our organization it's

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,540
an enormous amount of data we have a

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,560
hard time moving it around we have a

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,390
hard time managing it surprised if you

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,400
look to see how populous this data is

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,440
and this is a site can go to it's called

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,880
analytics dot usa.gov and the NOAA

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,800
websites and data sources are usually

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,140
among the most popular is usually in the

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,670
top three or top five this is just from

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,100
a snapshot from last week over the last

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,870
30 days so we usually get beeped out at

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,130
this time of year by the IRS that

00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,900
everyone wants to go if there's a site

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,780
called where's my refund that's usually

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,100
number one the post office is up there

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,690
near the top too but right up there and

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,940
forecast out weather gov and weather.gov

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,180
there's always near the top people

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,230
really need to consume this information

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,080
and if you look there's there's another

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,210
site called data.gov and be careful if

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
you go there because it's it's really

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,870
hard to use up emitted ly but it's a

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,200
first step the government's taken to try

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,239
to get our data stores out into the

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
public consciousness so if you go there

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,900
now you'll see we've got seventy

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,459
thousand data sets that are publicly

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,590
available okay and that's actually not

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,850
all of them it's most of them and those

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,260
of you that can read this I'm close

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,000
enough you can see part of the problem

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,650
that we have if anybody could actually

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,090
understand these descriptions of our

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,400
datasets if you're not actually notion

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,320
agra fur or meteorologist good luck to

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
you but so we have this problem with

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,030
translating hard data making it actually

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,350
useful to people who are smart want to

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,010
be all the users stuff but maybe aren't

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,130
subject matter experts but we've got all

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,769
this all this data about whether climate

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,959
ocean codes fisheries ecosystems they're

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,780
almost all open if you ask for them you

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,940
get them okay and most of them are

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,410
accessible on the internet today if you

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,390
know where to look and if you know who

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,100
to ask to translate a port so getting to

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,380
the the openness for open source and

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,039
open open data NOAA the big consumer of

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,220
open source of course but it's not my

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:26,710
only about open data today so we have a

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,810
it's built into our into our

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,150
organization to share share share we

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,710
share everything openly I think a lot of

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,150
this comes out in fact we're scientists

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,340
we come out of the academic science

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,289
community where sharing has always been

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,380
central to the success of the science

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:44,680
alright so so we've brought that with us

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,150
from the 80s and 90s into into our

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,080
organization our organization was

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,780
created in the early 1970s and so today

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,389
you still have a reflection of that

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,009
culture that opened culture into an

00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,949
operational government agency and it's a

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,500
very interesting culture that we have so

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:05,080
on the worldwide stage NOAA has been a

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,650
leader for the for the entire United

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,789
States in trying to broker data sharing

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,199
among countries and one of the most

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,030
successful ones have been through the

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,310
United Nations an organization called

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,449
World Meteorological Organization wmo

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:22,150
and after several about 10 years of

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,659
arguing about this and negotiating this

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,509
we there is international treaty today

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:30,370
that says environmental data for the

00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,889
protection of lives and property for the

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,620
good of society will be shared by all

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,729
countries as openly as possible and this

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,360
is one of our foundational you know

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,880
concepts that's built into our

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,639
organization and we have been have been

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:51,070
successful in getting other nations to

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:53,169
follow suit within the weather industry

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,090
and inside the United States there's

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:59,380
always been this tension between

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,759
commercial interests that are exploiting

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,320
this data for information products and

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,699
creating jobs we are part of the US

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,349
Department of Commerce so we love it

00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,560
when companies come and take our data

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,090
and and create jobs and and resell the

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,159
data or make new information products

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,990
that's what we want to see happen but

00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,009
that that that fine line between what

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,960
the government should do and what

00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,880
industry should do has always been a

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,969
little contentious a little bit of

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,820
tension there and that's good way back

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:28,690
when when I my first job with NOAA's

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,039
back in 1996 and I had created I worked

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,840
at the national data buoy Center which

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,150
has buoy data wave data if you're a

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,760
surfer you're familiar with the with the

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,860
website I got there there was an

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,540
availability of the data there's a an

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,250
old HP UNIX machine sitting around

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,780
they said well I'll throw a pachi on and

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,040
I'll throw all the data on there now I

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,460
threw good gnuplot on there which is

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,720
still working there today which is

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,330
there's a backstory of that to probably

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,070
but the idea was okay now you could get

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,350
all the data and you can see graphs of

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,940
it well true story the next day a phone

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,430
call came in from Washington said take

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,680
the website down somebody had called

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,120
their congressman and complained that

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,830
this government website was you know

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,420
overstepping its bounds and taking away

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,610
a business opportunity for somebody else

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,740
okay so this kind of just you know

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,870
cooler heads prevailed after a couple

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,810
days so I came back up it's been up ever

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,280
since but this is even just

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,690
demonstrative of the kind of tension

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,240
healthy tension that exists between

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,940
government and industry over who's

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,360
providing the data to who but but NOAA

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,280
has has responded to recommendations

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,380
from the National Academy of Sciences

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,500
and others to really define what this

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,600
partnership model really looks like and

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,570
built into this partnership policy is

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,950
okay the the we're committed to the

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,050
mission we're committed to consulting

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,940
with industry if we're going to change

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,680
our data systems or change our

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,200
observations we'll let everybody know

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,200
ahead of time we disseminate this

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,120
information openly as much as we can

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,680
equity fair and equitable access if you

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,890
have access you get the same kind of

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,510
access we don't play favorites and we we

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,120
recognize that industry is an important

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,860
important partner in the delivery of

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,250
information products to the American

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:13,510
public so one of the things that we do

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:18,100
that I'd like to change coming up is

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:20,800
that we tended to default to making our

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,680
products accessible in the public domain

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,500
we don't license our data we don't

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,270
license our software but we'll give it

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,360
out to anybody who wants it with no

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:34,030
restrictions on use and so interestingly

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,169
that actually restricts our ability to

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,720
distribute some products that have

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,180
shared IP we have partners in academia

00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,650
and industry that have contributed to

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,180
the development of these products and

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,290
sometimes if it's shared that we can't

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,530
actually distribute in the public domain

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,200
right so so by actually adopting some

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,050
modern licensing practices I think we

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,260
could actually share even more more

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,510
information

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,029
with the public and I know that the

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,310
Linux Foundation has has made progress

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,240
on the community data license agreement

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,370
this is one of the things I'd like to

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,630
possibly consider adopting for our

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:12,410
organization what's the value of this

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:15,320
data so this is just from last year 2017

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,910
how many billion dollar weather events

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,490
and climate events there were in the

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:24,019
country familiar with a lot of these

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,160
including them the hurricanes season one

00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,190
of the great success stories about

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,329
getting data out to the public and

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,370
adopting some of the new modern

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:35,149
technologies was related to Hurricane

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,279
Emma as you remember hit Florida as you

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,449
could imagine there are a lot of

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,880
American citizens that were hungry for

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,740
information and we're hitting the Noah

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,529
web sites very hard and data sites very

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,930
hard typically we have a hard time

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:51,790
keeping up with that kind of demand in

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:53,870
this case the National Hurricane Center

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,279
which part of our weather service part

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,959
of Noah

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,640
we took their website we put it on on

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,620
different infrastructure we put Amazon

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,329
Cloud Front in front of it and we were

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,070
able to handle over a billion hits a day

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,290
during this peak hurricane season

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,699
service never went down people got the

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,620
information they needed they're able to

00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:13,310
get out of harm's way so it's a it's a

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,050
great success story but we are still as

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,730
our Home Depot colleagues are saying you

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,010
know just starting to get into how to

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,529
adopt some of these more modern

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:23,209
technologies to do our job better the

00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,850
value of this data to the economy the

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,290
ocean economy this usually comes as as a

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,390
shock to a lot of people who don't

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,790
realize how many hundreds of billions of

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,490
dollars are riding on the ocean economy

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,100
this includes fisheries this includes

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,980
ocean transportation includes oil and

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,510
gas it is a very very big industry and

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,790
it's continuing to grow and it's

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,329
projected to grow over the next 20 years

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,279
the the weather Enterprise similarly as

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:51,800
we call it is continuing to grow as well

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,060
it should be about ten million dollars a

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,319
year right now this is the value of the

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,029
products and services that the

00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:59,389
commercial industries are selling and

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,550
two years ago for example IBM bought the

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:03,079
weather company it's a parent company of

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,370
The Weather Channel and stuff they

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,110
bought that company for two billion

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,670
dollars that was a thing that that's

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,200
that really

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,790
cause a lot of us and I know what a

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,710
sit-up Wow this is even more valuable

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,540
than we thought because the weather

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,790
company at the time was about 200 people

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,230
and you know it's a little bit of

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,510
infrastructure it's a significant

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,150
investment but IBM realized weather

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,020
touches every part of their company

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:29,870
every part of their of their services so

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,820
industry knows the value so what we're

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,710
trying to do now we're doing the

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,410
experiment we're trying to say can we

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,330
find a way to leverage that value that's

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,530
inherent in our data products can we

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,380
leverage that to make the data available

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,490
to even a wider group of people and make

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,230
it more easily understood because there

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,060
are two big challenges technicals how do

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,920
we get the data to you and then the

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,910
second is well how do we get you to

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,250
understand the data

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,240
those are both big challenges and so

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,790
we're doing something that we call the

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,450
Big Data project right now know describe

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,870
for you so to sum up the problems so

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,280
this is if I show you any any of our

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,480
graphs of our data volume they all look

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,280
like this they're all exponentially

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,960
growing this happens to be the archive

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,070
down in Asheville North Carolina where I

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,120
live and if you look at how much need is

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,460
actually going out so that was the

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,570
storage 30 petabytes right now this is

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,040
how much is going out you'll see the

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,110
same kind of exponential growth more and

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,750
more people are trying to pull more and

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,920
more data our systems are all throttle

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,360
because we have to protect them from

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,040
overuse right so we're getting hammered

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,870
every day by a lot of companies that

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,860
want the data and we have to restrict it

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,230
because we have to have that fair and

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,260
equitable access and we can't let the

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,760
the resource be restricted to you know

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,050
it's only to a few people with to make

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,970
sure everybody's got an equal chance of

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,290
getting the data and as you see it's

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,930
becoming a harder and harder job to do

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,360
it so in general or demand is growing

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,070
exponentially our costs are going up

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,960
because we need more servers we need

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,570
more network so it's it's growing

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,730
proportionally and continuously which is

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,380
a problem because our budgets look like

00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,240
this and that's kind of optimistic right

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,880
so it's it's not a not a great budget

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,960
environment right now that's okay so

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,640
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,080
say let's take this foundation of the

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,510
data and the expertise that NOAA has

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,670
let's partner with industry and have

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,590
them help facilitate the delivery of

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,900
data to third parties other companies

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:18,710
the public and any of the information

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,610
consumers that that we have and Jim

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,890
showed some some figures

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,079
gears but yesterday it's like oh great

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,029
this is peers and my thanks it but it

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,360
really is true it is a system interlock

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,529
system and and Noah's expertise there

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,300
and the oil kid none of this works

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,740
unless there's expertise there that's

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,810
being supplied to actually help people

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,029
understand what the data are so what we

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,500
did is we signed what we call

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,800
cooperative research and development

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:48,120
agreements or Kratos with five companies

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,649
with Amazon Microsoft IBM Google and a

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,180
nonprofit out of the University of

00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:54,240
Chicago called the open Commons

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,800
consortium and the agreement is that you

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,779
know a data are going to remain free and

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,089
open they can't be sold but they will

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,820
host the data at no cost to the taxpayer

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:06,839
and they are allowed to monetize

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,339
services around those data so make the

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,630
data more easily consumed or whatever

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,310
they can actually charge for that but

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,810
they can't actually sell the data so you

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,640
can go to these sites I'll give you some

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,839
URLs in a second you can download the

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,160
data for free if you want it to you but

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,899
they would like you to use them in place

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,019
and use their tools to analyze the data

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,579
use build products on on their on their

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,870
system so it's a it's a three year

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,959
actually going to four year we're doing

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,240
an extension right now so we're trying

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,790
to see whether this business experiment

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,470
can actually work so what we're doing

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,899
here in this schematic of we're taking

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,040
reaching into the the NOAA government

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,600
infrastructure we're reaching and we're

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,089
taking out one copy of the data

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
so typically we distribute thousands of

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,790
copies of the same data to everybody

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,860
that wants it from our federal systems

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,040
right now so instead said let's take one

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,360
copy out let's move it out to we're

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
actually using a data broker right now

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,899
an academic partner that's helping us

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,670
flip this data and figure out how to

00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,250
drop it into all of our collaborators

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,529
cloud platforms and they turn around and

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,440
serve many consumers from that so it's a

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:07,949
we went from a one-to-many to a 1 to a

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,760
few to many model of distribution if

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:15,240
that makes sense here's the URLs right

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,769
now that you can that you can and you

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,600
can get to either tell and mark you know

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,310
as ur still hasn't released any public

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,320
facing services to date which is there

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,060
right within the agreement don't mean to

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,220
leave them out but just nothing to offer

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,839
right now but I'll show you some

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,449
examples of these other ones in a second

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,260
Tim everybody's working hard on this too

00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,560
so as an example so weather radar data a

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,670
lot of

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,800
you familiar with seeing weather right

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,490
our data on the evening news are on your

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,650
app on your phone this was the first

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,570
dataset to move within this within this

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,300
project went to multiple of our

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,760
collaborators what we've seen on AWS

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,470
alone is that we've seen improvement of

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,720
over two times the amount of people

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,060
actually using the data we've seen a 50%

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,330
reduction on the NOAA server okay that's

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,740
good sign too and we've seen other other

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,600
uses of the data pop up that we didn't

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,180
expect so that's what we were hoping to

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,670
see but we can't predict these things so

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,040
if you're a meteorologist and and birds

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,050
are flying by your radar set right oh

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,640
this is this is noise and you remove

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,529
that from your signal but if you're

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,910
actually a bird migration biologist

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,130
that's actually what you're looking to

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,750
see right so some of the first folks

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,790
that come in to compute heavily on the

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,950
on AWS actually where the bird migration

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,480
scientists who are able to track birds

00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:33,480
from this 20-year time series across the

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,480
United States and now of people that are

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,450
come looking for for weather radar data

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,910
we call NEXRAD weather radar data 80% of

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,610
those users now are going to AWS to get

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,580
the data because it's it's faster and

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,650
easier for them to do so Google is

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,280
loaded a lot of our climate data into

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,830
bigquery and we've seen petabytes of

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,180
data that this data sets like a terabyte

00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,680
size and they've been able to move

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,150
petabytes of this data just in a few

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,560
months just because the data now has

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,750
been loaded into a tool people are

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,699
already using and it reduces that

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,650
obstacle of understanding you don't have

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,300
to understand a scientific data format

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,030
you can go right into bigquery

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,730
you can join on the data you can do

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:19,770
analyses and and people are very

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:22,350
interesting group they're the occ the

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,240
open commas consortium is using jupiter

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,980
notebooks and putting putting base of

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,070
the recipe for how to use the data out

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,290
next to the data and i don't think this

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,690
is gonna it's not gonna play there's

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,179
actually video so Tampa Bay Times after

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,310
the hurricane urmom event a couple of

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,160
these reporters actually wanted to tell

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,929
a story about the evacuation of Florida

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,820
and how close Florida came to really

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,140
almost like a worst-case scenario of the

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,830
storm coming up the East Coast where the

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,620
majority of population is

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,419
and they they were able to use the image

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,510
the satellite imagery and the code

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:58,269
provided on the occ platform to to

00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,890
create a video story board for their

00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,330
newspaper and these are not scientists

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,190
these are people that just yeah hey we

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,929
have an interest we need to put some

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,570
context they reached out they got the

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,399
real data and able to integrate it is a

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,799
great example for how this kind of stuff

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,630
can work iBM has created a whole bunch

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,059
of new api's it can tie into it and ties

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,320
into their bluemix platform I'm running

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,840
out of times I'm moving ahead little

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,350
quickly here and one of the problems

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,860
that that we're encountering is so

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,200
people trust NOAA's data today because

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,240
they get it from a NOAA data service but

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,309
now we're asking something else we're

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,260
asking them to trust the NOAA data that

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,990
exists outside the federal system on a

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,549
partner system right and I think we're

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,380
still a little bit ahead about ahead of

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,559
the problem but going back to the Erma

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:47,230
example again this was a fake forecast

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,820
that showed up on Facebook okay and now

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,130
it's got the NOAA logo on there it is

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,649
somebody I guess meant it as a joke the

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,360
National Weather Service does not think

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,860
this is very funny right they do not

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
play around with lives and property and

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,760
they were very concerned about this

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,799
because there's no way to validate the

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,779
the forecast against the actual NOAA

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,450
data we don't have a mechanism yet in

00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,210
place where it could easily be done but

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,799
you know you know very quickly this

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,880
thing spread like wildfire and it was

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,559
supposed to be a joke that you know

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,779
Irma's gonna hit Houston again or

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,500
something like that but this definitely

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:21,700
caught NOAA leadership attention and in

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
the general with this big data project

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,139
on talked about we are seeking ways of

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,970
making sure that the NOAA brand the

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,980
trust that comes with the NOAA brand is

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,059
conveyed with the data and so people

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,740
could understand when they're using the

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:37,659
data it's the real thing that they can

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,460
have trust in so in summary so we have a

00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:42,669
very proud history of this open data

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,110
leadership continuing on that path and

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,700
we're trying to see how we could amplify

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,010
that can we even take that to greater

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,470
levels of making this very valuable data

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,750
more useful to any of you out there that

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,610
has an idea of how you could use NOAA

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,980
data if it's being made available

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,899
through these modern cloud platforms

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,000
does that make it easier for you to

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,840
actually create information products of

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,419
value to you

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,620
your company and to your customers and

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,440
of course we're also looking for other

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:12,039
ways of just doing our our business

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,990
better and we are we are seeking a way

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,360
like I said right now by definition this

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,490
is an experiment for a defined amount of

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,650
time we're looking to see if this makes

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,230
sense with our partners like Azure and

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,809
Google and Amazon hey can we actually do

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,429
this sustainably going forward and do

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,919
this as a matter of a part of our normal

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,690
operations and we'll know that probably

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,860
by early next year all right well thank

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:38,150
you very much for your time

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,150
