bring everyone all right all right a

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,790
little bit energy I'm I was asked to

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,469
talk about blockchain

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,980
get in the bingo cloud they they get

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,260
this now but we're talking about a

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,650
little different variant of it we're not

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:32,690
talking about I cos talking about

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:37,860
playing all those kinds of things okay

00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,809
so healthcare and we'll talk a little

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,690
bit about change healthcare in a minute

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:48,870
now but really what I want to start with

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:50,910
is sorry about all the echos is how

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,410
we've gotten here right and we're all

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,399
familiar with the history here of

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,620
Technology computers and networks

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,930
mobility automation and change

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,080
healthcare pills blockchain has another

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,869
piece in this and we're building on the

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,640
shoulders of giants as they say

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,299
why is blockchain interesting to us I'm

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,470
going with this

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,590
okay here we all want a future where

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,590
information is available it's complete

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,299
it's accurate we all know the issues

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,880
where you have to go to another party

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,290
and find out if you have access to the

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,390
information if the information is

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,189
accurate we see the issues with the

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,070
credit bureaus we see the issues in

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,350
healthcare all over the place so these

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,049
are attributes that blockchain

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,119
technology brings to bear that make it a

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,490
really interesting compelling technology

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,340
for change healthcare who's changed

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,860
healthcare I be surprised many people in

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,790
the room here at heard of us we're

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,799
getting more we're improving our

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,630
marketing and who we are we actually sit

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,210
in a very interesting place in

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,790
healthcare we're the infrastructure

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,219
where the we're the company that

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,320
connects the epics the Cerner's we

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,439
connect the University of Chicago's and

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,250
Northwestern's Kaiser Permanente is the

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,770
optimist

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,510
I love those names you know of their

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,770
supplying healthcare they're paying for

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,430
your healthcare but the way they

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,620
communicate

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,409
or through networks financial networks

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,959
medical networks pharmacy networks and

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,870
that's what we provide it's a company

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,319
that has been put together over several

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,049
decades and we just went through a big

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,780
merger last year about 15,000 employees

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:37,280
two out of three claims in the u.s. are

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,680
moving through our networks 800,000

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,349
providers over 20 100 payers so you can

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,870
see we have an opportunity to be looking

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,400
at technology and to be looking at the

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,299
healthcare system in the u.s. in a very

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,120
different way which we think we have

00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:56,310
hyper ledger a Linux Foundation project

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
and change healthcare as we have were

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,840
looking at watching technology over the

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,670
last few years we did a lot of internal

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,519
discussions about it we did internal

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,379
proof of concepts we started talking to

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,980
vendors and and they wanted to do proof

00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,579
of concepts with us but what we really

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:17,180
believe in is that blockchain requires a

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:21,180
network a network of participants and

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,699
what we saw was that all these pieces

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,060
were either coming together or had

00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,290
already started being sorted out by

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,260
different groups and in different ways

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,209
and so participating in the hyper ledger

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,909
project really made a lot of sense for

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,790
us protocol governance consensus

00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,379
mechanisms smart contracts identity when

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,470
you think about healthcare these are all

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,940
very important topics and very important

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,000
pieces of the puzzle that you have to

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,370
put together the trust is different in

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,239
healthcare than it is in financial

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,879
applications

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,849
I spent a chunk of my career building

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,470
derivatives platforms globally and

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,389
understand those networks in that kind

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,909
of scale healthcare especially in the

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,280
u.s. is very fragmented what is identity

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,889
who has the right to see a record what

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,680
portions of the record can you see

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:12,750
individuals in the US can can segment

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,609
their healthcare record and only give

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,180
providers particular access to

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:21,209
particular information patients in the

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,950
US can deny their insurance company

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,740
access to their medical records or even

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,450
some procedures in some services it's a

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,910
it's quite a mix

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,920
and was you look through what blockchain

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,530
has begun to put together and the pieces

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,090
have been built on top of blockchain you

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,160
start seeing different pieces of that

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,440
puzzle appearing on the board that you

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
can put together when we think about

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,720
smart contracts up here it's a an

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,900
important piece between the providers

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,950
and the payers right is the provider

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,530
executing a standard service and should

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,050
get paid right away are they executing

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,750
that service in a way that the payer

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,230
makes sense to them so why do we choose

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,780
fabric had a lot of great points to it

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,390
I'm not going to drain the slide here

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,130
but one of the big pieces was we wanted

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,970
something that was more than just

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,700
finance and had been applied in other

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,740
areas we do have a financial network as

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,270
well as a healthcare network so it was

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,700
important to us to have some variety

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,610
there and the consensus model was a

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,820
another piece we're not looking at a

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,110
public blockchain in healthcare yet what

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,730
we wanted to do and I'll talk a little

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,770
more about how we've we've used this

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,570
technology in production we wanted to

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,550
start creating the space in the room to

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,670
have that conversation what is public

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,850
blockchain in healthcare and the u.s.

00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,920
notably look like and so our consensus

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,140
model could be very lightweight where we

00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,990
started private removing of permissioned

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,300
with our customers but we know who's in

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,130
the game we don't have a mining aspect

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,570
of it either so it's very simple we're

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,090
using blockchain for what it was built

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,990
to do store information and store

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,520
securely ins stored everywhere

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,020
multi-chain gives us some privacy we

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,820
also have another interesting aspect

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,700
given the position we sit in in

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,490
healthcare we have many competitors

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,610
working with us so imagine if we rolled

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,230
out one blockchain network where all

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,580
things were visible and all the

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,220
different insurers in the US could

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,020
suddenly see each other's behavior and

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,340
everything they were doing on it and

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,160
what they were paying what they were not

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,830
paying how fast they were processing who

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,410
they were processing with these types of

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,910
things we wanted to create space to work

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,040
through those conversations and I

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,320
privileged your fabric gave us some nice

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,940
channels some sub Ledger's on there that

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,580
we could use to to create that space

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:47,650
we are with the public and public

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:50,260
blockchain and the pH I questions keep

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,970
taking this forward here so another

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,740
thing that we really liked about hyper

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,450
larger fabric because we built out our

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,670
nodes and started running our test

00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,740
networks we were able to run at a really

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,890
high volume the amount of claims that we

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,590
process every day is is the highest in

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,150
the United States and to take a

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,740
blockchain solution that can do two

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,300
transactions a second wouldn't serve

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,360
right it would be a really nice

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,620
prototype you know we probably get a

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,740
little bit of press out of it but it

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:21,610
wouldn't actually work we wanted to put

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,320
this into production so as we ran it we

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,090
were able to run it 50 million

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,490
transactions a day five hundred fifty

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,310
per second that actually takes care of

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,620
us healthcare and us claims and there's

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,810
slow growth in claims in healthcare

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,520
today it's actually you know population

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,350
sizes flattened out level of cares

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,440
flattening out and then you're looking

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,260
at bundled payments is becoming a

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,230
greater aspect of that mix as well so

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,550
these volumes especially knowing that

00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,540
technology always is going to give us

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,480
more in the future

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,640
worked out really well for us and our

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,500
substantive lis higher than what you may

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,300
see in other applications of blockchain

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,650
depending on the level of trust and the

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:06,250
consensus model so a little bit of why

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,320
this is interesting to us we're building

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,140
an intelligent healthcare platform out

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,150
of all of our different solutions we've

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,910
acquired a lot of siloed solutions over

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,860
the years we have some great teams that

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,590
are our building server list building

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,300
container moving very quickly bringing

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,180
all these solutions together so our

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,130
customers have a greater experience with

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,940
us improve they can do their jobs faster

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,700
and blockchain brought us a lot of the

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,180
pieces claims network data rights

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,030
management that really helped us with

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,099
this mission so we we took one of our

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,880
products that gets here

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,400
yeah assurance reimbursement manager

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,200
recently renamed and you can see a

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,390
claims network here where there's a

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,650
payer an insurance company there's a

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,500
claim some

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,050
a provider your physician sitting there

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,900
and claims are moving moving through the

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,400
network and what change healthcare does

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,740
is we don't simply just store and

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,720
forward a claim we had a lot of value on

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,670
top of that both providers and payers

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,170
are making edits to those claims they're

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,880
approving some of them quicker than

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,680
others there's a lot they're doing

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,020
revenue cycle management on top of those

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,610
claims so there's a that claim

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,980
processing workflow that's happening

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,140
inside also has many other products on

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,390
top of it so that organizations in

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,910
healthcare can run more effectively and

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,200
when you think about why why that's

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,029
valuable the less your doctor spends on

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,890
their back office the more they can

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,540
spend with you the more time they can

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,420
spend with you the more their resources

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,430
they can put towards your care and

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,350
that's what we're trying to enable so we

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,050
we brought in hyper ledger fabric made

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,790
it part of our claims network and what

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,589
we started doing was driving the events

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,260
out of the claims network into that

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,740
blockchain and again we were using hyper

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,589
ledger fabric we have channels enabled

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,510
and what the graph is also showing here

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,860
is we're starting to take events that

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,930
are occurring on the botching and having

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,150
it drive our network one of the other

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,760
important aspects of what we're doing is

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,730
we're not building from scratch we're

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,820
not a startup saying hey I've got this

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,830
really great idea for a healthcare

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,170
network that's built on blockchain we're

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,550
actually already processing two out of

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,770
three of the claims like I mentioned

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,089
earlier we don't want to stop that and

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,850
start all over again we want to take

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,500
that volume and evolve that network and

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,450
evolve all of the capabilities built on

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,790
top of that network leveraging the

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,560
strengths of blockchain so we we've

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,589
wedded them together if we put those

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,970
capabilities into production and it's

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,120
been a really good experience internally

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,620
it took a couple of months didn't take

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,570
man years and working with hyper-alert

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,020
fabric was was really easy and really

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,870
direct one of the the reasons we thought

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,120
this was an important step to take is we

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,670
think watching technology can really

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,970
change how healthcare operates the

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,529
business models operate hyper laser was

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,269
nice enough to put

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,310
a little vlog I wrote up a couple weeks

00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,170
ago about how you have to really use the

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,579
technology to start examining the

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,019
different business models that can be

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:19,029
created from it and with the when you

00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:20,050
look at it the the variety of

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,879
discussions that happen around

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,129
blockchain in healthcare there's a lot

00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,749
of hypotheses there's a lot of possible

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,420
uses there's a lot of this is a great

00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:31,029
idea someone should do it in and we

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,730
wanted to step step the conversation

00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,199
forward and by really putting in

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,600
production really putting it into

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:40,779
production on a massive amount of data

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,249
and assets and volume and activity we're

00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,529
able to sit down with our customers who

00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:46,689
are thinking about using blockchain who

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:48,189
have people who are thinking about how

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,860
that would change their organization's

00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:53,019
operationally and with their technology

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,269
and really sit down and say all right

00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,800
let's let's do something let's take it

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,139
will give you a node right you'll be

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,720
permissioned and we'll take it forward

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,189
with you and build these new models what

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,059
does it claim look like when the flow

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,949
isn't linear

00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,050
right when the provider isn't handing it

00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,639
off to us when we're performing our

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,620
services on top of it we hand it off to

00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,089
the payer and back and forth and

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,939
everyone's looking at the same claim at

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,920
the same time it's a simple example but

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:20,019
it changes a lot of paradigms it changes

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,660
a lot of expectations so we wanted to

00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,000
bring data we wanted to bring real

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,790
activity and we brought it together in a

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,459
way where our customers continue to use

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,720
their existing systems and services to

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:36,129
interact with us whether it's through

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,569
API you eyes et cetera and they can

00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,040
start working with blockchain as well

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,170
and they're all working with one flow

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,939
they don't have to change how they are

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,189
handling their patients today are

00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:49,029
handling their members on the insurance

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:52,300
side this is showing the different

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,790
different pieces of it medical review

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,209
eligibilities you know I've talked about

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:01,240
a lot of what this slide is trying to

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,800
relate already in it's really the power

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,559
of hooking all this together as a

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,829
network a one-off blockchain proof of

00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:11,259
concept is is simply an exercise right

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,569
there's a lot of healthcare revenue

00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,519
cycle blockchain exercises out there

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,650
there's blockchain networks out there

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,970
without any volume on them

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,640
people are trying to figure out how to

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,290
use them and we wanted to basically

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,690
contribute our volume contribute our

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,770
data and really push those conversations

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:34,160
forward we think adoption will continue

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,580
and we think it'll come in phases so

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,800
what we've started with is it at the

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,350
very beginning right node management

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,600
we're working on smart contracts I

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,100
mentioned earlier if you break your arm

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,660
and there's a standard procedure for

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,330
breaking your arm and if the payer and

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,860
the provider both agree on what that is

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,260
there's no reason they shouldn't be

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,690
paying that immediately moving that

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,240
money approving that claim patient could

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,890
literally walk out knowing how much they

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,060
have to pay rather than you know the

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:07,270
bills and and the chasing that goes on

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,450
taking it up to exchanging clinical data

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:14,750
fraud detection transaction auditing all

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,140
the way through to payments etc we see a

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:22,100
really nice path of using blockchain in

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,390
healthcare and again we think this is

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,940
something that's important to be open

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,390
sourced we do we looked at a lot of

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,940
different private protocols and they all

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,920
had pros and cons but when we thought

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,770
about the the broadness that we were

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,750
looking for an adoption just in the u.s.

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:42,260
right you recall those numbers from

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,700
before 2100 payers over 800,000

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,280
providers or just hooked into our

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:50,350
network alone convincing them all to buy

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,420
the same vendors the protocol stack

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,400
would be very challenging

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,410
sticking with open source not only

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,700
leverages the great work that you know

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,620
hundreds and thousands of people are

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,850
doing but also makes that adoption

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:09,790
easier really improving the outcomes for

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:13,850
the patients at the end of the day so

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,440
I'll end here where these are the types

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,220
of solutions we're looking at change

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,080
healthcare again with blockchain hyper

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,410
ledger fabric continues to show its its

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:28,130
strengths and how we're using it

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:30,620
integrated applications a path right I

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,930
spoke earlier about how we are working

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,750
all

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:38,310
that having a public blockchain for

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,920
healthcare in the u.s. is a long road to

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,360
get there and rather than sitting down

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,800
and having everyone try to figure out

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,230
what that looks like and then build it

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,029
we want to start using blotching in

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,570
healthcare today we have started using

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,350
it today and create a space to have that

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,600
conversation

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,510
what does pH eye look like on the

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,540
blockchain in a public sense what is a

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,370
pointer to where the pH I is stored on a

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,380
public watching look like how do you

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,149
control access what side nd look like

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,529
you know project in D and some of these

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:13,320
other pieces that are coming into play

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:15,029
as well consumer application this is a

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,890
really interesting topic and blockchain

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:19,589
I'm not going to drill deep on it here I

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,990
don't know of any consumers who like

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,810
interacting with blockchain technology I

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:29,100
don't know of any moms dads sisters

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:31,500
brothers cousins friends who have an

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,600
application that really interacts well

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,640
with potcheen technology and lets them

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,709
know what's going on so we're we've

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,170
pushed it into our infrastructure we'll

00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,720
expose it as time goes on and as it

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,910
evolved and the tool evolved but we

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,890
think there's going to be something

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,230
there whether it's individuals choosing

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,890
to use wallets individuals using it for

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:56,370
identity lots of opportunities there and

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:58,860
then lastly keeping it open the

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,140
consensus models will evolve over time

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,000
and and we think the best pool of

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,179
activity is happening in the open source

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,010
community smart contracts etc there's a

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,730
lot of other organizations out there

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,650
that are creating opportunities are

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,059
creating conversations some of them

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,400
we're hoping will come into this tent

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,740
some of them you know we'll continue to

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,589
talk with but there's really a strength

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,980
in open source we really appreciate it

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:28,679
and you know one of the things that

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,600
change healthcare really is focused on

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,730
the next 18 months is how do we

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,160
contribute more back to the open source

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,050
community we've really been focused this

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,090
last year on bringing this entire

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,059
organization together and we're really

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,760
looking for going forward permanently

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,799
and contributing back to open source and

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,690
really letting people see and understand

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,400
the the great technology we've created

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,309
and the great technology we're using

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,419
from organizations like hyper ledger so

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,670
