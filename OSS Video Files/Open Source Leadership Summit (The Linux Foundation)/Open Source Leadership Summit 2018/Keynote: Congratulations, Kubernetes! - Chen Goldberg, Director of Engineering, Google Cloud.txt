	Keynote: Congratulations, Kubernetes! - Chen Goldberg, Director of Engineering, Google Cloud

Congratulations, Kubernetes!

W00t! With the risk of sounding cliche graduation is a very exciting time, it marks both an ending and a beginning. Looking back on my journey with Kubernetes, I have memories of significant milestones for this project like establishing a release cadance and announcing the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program. There were key lessons along the way, with learning opportunities at every turn. Join me as I talk through some of the most memorable memories and what I have learned from them.

good morning everybody so hi I'm Ken and

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm an engineering director at Google

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,799
and I'm leading the development of some

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,809
of the open source technologies you

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,570
already heard about kubernetes and also

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,219
East EO and also responsible for some of

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,710
our products like google kubernetes

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,779
engine hey I'm really excited to be here

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,730
this is already my favorite event of the

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,850
year by choosing this amazing location

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,160
and the weather and I'm really looking

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,480
forward to meet many of you and speak

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,560
about the thing that we are all very

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,630
passionate about today is a very very

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,219
special day for the kubernetes community

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,500
and also for the cloud native compute

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,930
foundation today we announced that

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,940
kubernetes is being graduation a

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:51,239
graduating from incubation as the first

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:54,840
project out of CN CF graduation is a

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,730
signal of maturity of a project from the

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,399
early days when the Google engineering

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,320
team started to work on kubernetes they

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,080
collaborated with people from companies

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,049
like Red Hat and coalesce and and also

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,240
customers like box and everybody worked

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,049
together and bringing different

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,280
perspective ideas skills experience and

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,009
really building this technology with the

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,070
goal to solve right speaking to what

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:27,240
genes before really solve problems for

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,909
users wherever they are and what was

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,070
amazing that not only we got many

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,110
contribution but because of the nature

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,360
of the community and the openness we

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,990
were also able to build a really rich

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,740
ecosystem around that filling the gap

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,630
where it's needed so some metrics of how

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,520
success looks like I just added this

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,930
morning with the github stars and

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,030
probably we need to do it again after

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:56,549
this after today and luckily users are

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,799
recognizing it the success of kubernetes

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,930
the stability of this project and this

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,100
is really if you look on the CN CF of

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,450
what graduation means it means a

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,950
governance model it talks about more

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,379
than one contributor but on top of

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,700
everything it's about users using it in

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,610
production and this is definitely an

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,760
the entire list and new users using

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,980
kubernetes everyday and what I love

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,140
about it and it's not shown here that

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,360
all of us contributing to kubernetes are

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,330
also using kubernetes as an example for

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,980
Google itself we are building google

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,989
kubernetes engine using upstream

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:38,420
kubernetes we have products like cloud

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:39,800
ml running on gke internally and that's

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,830
what makes it better because we all

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,150
benefit from that technology and

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,310
benefits include of course agility

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,610
that's what drives everything this is

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,530
what drives adoption today and agility

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,780
is measured with how quickly you can

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,940
deploy to production how quickly you can

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,440
set up environments with the complexity

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,290
of multiple workloads and an

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,090
infrastructure leveraging cloud native

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,040
technologies this summer that's really

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,080
cool Benares is putting a gopher and

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,390
definitely since EF making it easy to

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
adopt those took those technology

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,989
without the need to modernize everything

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,600
already and the pace of adoption also

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,940
keeps us on the edge as a community

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,260
really trying to innovate and and meet

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,150
the demand of our customers so how did

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,470
we get here right this is why we're here

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,290
this is the intention of this entire

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:33,500
week to talk about how can you build a

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:37,100
successful project like kubernetes so

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,019
when then send me an email like hey man

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,340
can you come and speak in the open

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,109
source video ships I mean are like yes

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,640
what do you want me to talk about and he

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,100
said like if you can just tell everybody

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:51,799
how you made it work and that will be

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:54,370
great like well I wish I could the truth

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,900
is that the world is changing very fast

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,850
okay and the days kubernetes was started

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,980
four years ago so maybe for some of you

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,170
it seemed like it was overnight it

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,170
wasn't overnight it has been four years

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,109
of working and adapting to the pace of

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,600
technology in the industry so there is

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,160
no playbook but definitely there are

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,739
some really great memories and like

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,510
every graduation I want to walk you some

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,900
to some of them and talk about some of

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,180
the learnings so how do you balance

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,240
between open source and non open source

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,460
investment

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,350
if only I had a dollar every time

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,090
someone asked me that I would probably

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,860
not be standing here and I would be

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,280
vacationing maybe in Hawaii or something

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,860
somewhere else and this comes up from

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,419
everybody from customers from engineers

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,360
that want to join the team from product

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,919
management executives there is real

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,500
tension because it's really hard to

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,330
rationalize so you're taking all this IP

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,280
and making it available to everybody and

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm sure all of you are familiar with

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,009
this challenge in mind in my mind one of

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,370
the choices that we did in Google within

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:06,150
my team is decided open-source is part

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,539
of the strategy it's not a side gig it's

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,610
not something we just take outside it

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,320
was part of the strategy from the

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,060
beginning right if you will read the

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,849
original story of kubernetes it was

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,710
about getting adoption it was about

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:24,060
getting feedback it was about building

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,940
an ecosystem we have made a decision

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,560
that kubernetes upstream is the core

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,750
technology that we are building our

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
products on so if you are investing in

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,580
kubernetes you're literally also

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,599
investing in gke at the same time and

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:45,150
what I found is that if you explain

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,729
developers in particular that our users

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,470
are benefiting from open source okay

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,960
they are benefitting from the fact that

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,990
kubernetes runs everywhere it helps them

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,000
solve problem that helps solve the

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,659
attention okay because we are not doing

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,099
it just for the sake of the tech or just

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:05,310
to make something cool open source we

00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:07,080
are really helping our users and this is

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,930
a journey right and that journey to

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,610
moving to cloud will be a long one and

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,270
for many of the customers there will

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,409
always be that hybrid environment

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,539
another point I want to talk about

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,210
specifically about for all the

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,860
engineering managers here one thing that

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,770
was important for me is also to build

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,050
one team there is no open source team

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,750
and a product team there is one team

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:34,020
there is one strategy one backlog one

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,849
team and I believe that throughout the

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,729
years GK

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,069
has benefited so benefited so much with

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,349
working with the kubernetes users but

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,629
also the other way around I know that

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,339
kubernetes the project benefited from

00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:54,869
the experience that we have gathered

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:58,619
with our gke customers so this is my

00:06:54,869 --> 00:07:01,080
first community meeting it was almost

00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:03,679
two years ago so community meeting in

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,539
kubernetes every Thursday 10:00 a.m.

00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,209
Pacific time we are meeting we're

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,240
inviting everybody from the community

00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:15,509
everything is recorded available on

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,330
YouTube of course and we talk we talk

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:21,990
about things we talked about project

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:24,449
ecosystem demos and you can imagine so

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,819
this is like probably my second month in

00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:31,559
Google and it can be very intimidating

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:33,389
okay going up and speaking about

00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,860
something and this was you know I can

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,240
still remember about that I remember

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,610
speaking for the first time and I had

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,610
the Brian cheering for me saying it's

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,699
gonna be okay and this was in the in the

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,259
middle of 1.3 kubernetes released and in

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,740
this particular example we were debating

00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,129
whether to reduce the amount of

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:58,499
development in favor of stabilization

00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:59,969
and the reason we did it is because at

00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:01,949
least I even particularly wanted to

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:04,949
increase our release cadence and make it

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,779
stable and get to the point that if you

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,289
miss the train you can always catch the

00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,479
next one

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,669
and really build that release train and

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,819
today kubernetes is releasing every

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:18,300
three months or 100 days and really

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,709
connais improved on that and I think

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,800
from this example there are two things

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:25,289
that everybody can learn on engineering

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
and management practices we saw some

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,119
questions before how do you manage open

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,490
source how do you prioritize I really

00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:34,529
believe that there is actually shouldn't

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,479
be any difference from the way you

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,240
manage an open source product in an

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,459
engineering team to the way you manage

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,919
your own a commercial product or your

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:47,699
own product itself those engineering

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,080
practices agile release Cayden defining

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,870
the quality bar

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,780
Stane documentation stabilization period

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,300
marketing all of those things they are

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,300
all needed for an open-source project if

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,770
you wanted to be successful and this is

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,230
definitely something that we had in our

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:10,490
mind doing kubernetes and it feels like

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,490
one engineering team the other point is

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,810
transparency well it might be

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,500
intimidating to be recorded all the time

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,050
and everything is visible to everybody

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,030
but it also empowers people to speak and

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,190
join the conversation because they can

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,330
go and look on what was before and what

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,180
decisions were made and what

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,060
alternatives were considered so for me

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,880
while it was a bit hard I also felt in

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,040
that it was encouraging to have new

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,010
people join the conversation and really

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,750
it helps to build trust and Trust like

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,090
any other team whether if it's

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,330
engineering product marketing or in any

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:51,050
other industry Trust is key to build a

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,050
team that works together

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,150
this was another exciting moment so I'm

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,370
pretty sure that i don''t reintroduce

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:04,410
pokemon girl so it was around July 2016

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,860
and the entire world was working like

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,170
that

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,830
and all the kids were working like that

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,720
how many picked here played Pokemon go

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,490
so I didn't because it was wrong it is

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,060
running on GK and I was afraid to add

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:22,020
more load but other than that no back

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:25,320
telling the Tina don't lay down play and

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,940
but this was exciting times okay so the

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,830
entire world there was this crazy

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,650
excitement about Pokemon go and we

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,700
couldn't tell anyone that it runs on G

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,470
key that it runs on kubernetes and you

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,940
can see here this is one of the graphs

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,170
that they published about how the

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:47,280
traffic that they had was 50 times what

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:50,120
they expected 50 times you can see the

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,500
graph and and that could have become a

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,990
successful disaster but instead because

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,970
of cloud native technologies because of

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,410
technologies like kubernetes they were

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,430
able to scale the cluster

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:11,019
as a demand without interrupting the way

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,629
they serve their users and in my mind

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,420
this is something that is also very

00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,490
important in any open-source project in

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,399
any open source product focus on the

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,810
user what problems are you solving what

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,680
is the pain that you need to solve and

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,810
something that I love about the

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,329
kubernetes community is that we are very

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,639
pragmatic we're not trying to look for

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,610
the perfect solution we're trying to

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,699
solve problems for users and make sure

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,519
that it's practical and they can use it

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:46,329
and one concrete example would be when

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,149
cubanos 1.0 was announced it supported

00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:51,310
100 node clusters this is not a Google

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,279
scale cluster right it's only 100 nodes

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,410
but for that time that was the right

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,560
size for people that wants to kick the

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,740
tire and try their technology if we

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,170
would have tried to do Google scale like

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,439
kubernetes we would probably be blocked

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,540
forever but this time went by and we got

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:13,029
more things in we improved on that and

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,009
today we have 5,000 node a cluster and

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,459
to be honest with you that 100 node

00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,560
cluster is still a good fit for many of

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,980
the users of kubernetes today and that

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,490
what makes it relevant for many a

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:30,880
customers and users and celebrate

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,870
success the success of Pokemon go was

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,600
not just my team or just googles

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,970
everybody that worked on kubernetes to

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,040
build that contributed to pokemons go

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,230
and that was a celebration for the

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,610
entire community just to show some of

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,220
that success but not everything in

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:57,279
open-source is rainbow and butterflies I

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,990
wish but now so when we started to talk

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,910
about kubernetes and talk about the

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,519
culture we talked about the values and

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,939
transparency and respect and it was easy

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,730
when the community was 600 people but

00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:12,499
then it became 1,200 and then 1,500 and

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:16,459
then 2,000 and then three thousand

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:18,889
and from three companies committing to

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:22,939
10 to 20 and more and it becomes more

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:25,519
complex and in particular like again

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:27,229
like any other organization when you

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,969
scale you need to react and you need to

00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:33,049
think about what do you change in order

00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:35,299
to meet the new skill one specific

00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,729
problem we had was with processes when

00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,889
everybody knew everybody it was easy to

00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:41,749
make decisions so we had this idea we

00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,639
say hey we we have those SIG's we have

00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,029
special interest groups they meet and

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,619
they make decisions and it's all great

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,659
but then we have some new people that

00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,839
are joining and data now is that person

00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:55,969
who is the sidled and why that person

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,889
get to make a decision or I am and now

00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,559
if I want to contribute how can I engage

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:05,709
and how can I improve my leadership and

00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:07,999
become a leader of this community and

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:10,699
this is again another signal of the

00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:14,869
graduation today is working about on our

00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:17,329
governance model in October 2017 we

00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:18,829
elected our steering committee and the

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,559
steering committee is not about making

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:24,379
all the decisions it's about ensuring

00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,999
there is a way to make decision there is

00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,539
a way to escalate there is a way to

00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:33,169
challenge and just the other day Sarah

00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:36,379
Nevada published the values of the

00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:38,059
kubernetes community before we all knew

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,759
the values but this is not good enough

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:42,949
anymore we have to document it so people

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,989
that want to join our community know

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,989
what are the things that we work by

00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,209
scanning is not just about processes you

00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:57,289
also need to scale the technology

00:14:53,209 --> 00:15:01,959
it was around also the end of 2016 when

00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:04,909
we felt that we there is a velocity heat

00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,109
it was harder to innovate you would

00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:09,979
change something here and something

00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:12,799
broke there you needed there was how to

00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:16,129
get reviewers for everything and really

00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,809
nobody was able to understand the entire

00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,779
complexity of the system so if you look

00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,119
on this slide Brian grant created this

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,880
diagram to capture the scope of

00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:28,730
kubernetes the complexity of it

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,570
it's almost the same of an entire cloud

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,340
provider so about that time what we

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,860
decided to do and I wish by the way that

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,750
we have done more at the beginning of it

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,150
it's really investing in what are the

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,400
extension points to kubernetes and

00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,140
anyone it is now thinking about a new

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,000
open source project talking about

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,360
internal probability and like you

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,790
mentioned before it is critical so while

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,320
it might seem for people that it's not

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,660
that important we can wait with that

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
extension points are critical and

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,370
they're key for success sustainable

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,890
success so as you're looking under there

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,630
there are over a dozen extension points

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:11,030
today and naming few our web hooks CRI a

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,190
container runtime interface a client

00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,200
libraries cloud providers and what's

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,410
amazing about it that it helps us to

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,440
innovate and build new things for

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,470
example open service broker still and

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,540
there are some really awesome a 7s

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,280
framework that are already using those

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:37,100
extension and that allows them to

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:39,430
innovate even faster conformance just

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,290
three months ago we announced the

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,270
certification a conformance program for

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,750
kubernetes because having those

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,150
extension points is not enough we wanted

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,210
to make sure that we reduce the risk of

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:56,150
fragmentation okay we are planning for

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,400
success so how can customers partners

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:03,189
make sure that this is upstream

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:06,970
kubernetes the entire API interface is

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:10,550
usable and available for you to use and

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,500
that was amazing because this was a

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,510
community effort and that really

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,360
represents one of the values of the

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,780
kubernetes community which is community

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,970
before product community before company

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,949
because for a single company that might

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,839
not be the most important thing but as a

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,150
community we want to make sure that

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,340
kubernetes will stay for a very long

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,800
time and we'll keep hearing about it in

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,080
many years to come so right now I think

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,410
there are about 20 something today there

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,900
are over 50 companies that are

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,900
compliant with the conformance program

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,420
so what can you learn about everything

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,900
that we have done with kubernetes the

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:56,190
first thing is intentional leadership

00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:00,130
you have to plan to plan nothing happens

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:03,030
just by doing stuff or not being

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,310
thoughtful about what is our goal

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,400
what's your open-source strategy what is

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,680
your expectation from the community what

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,040
is the release process how do you ensure

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:18,640
quality invest time and think about it

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,040
and make sure that your actions are

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,380
aligned with your intentions and if they

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,600
are not change your actions we all make

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,120
mistakes and we make experiments but

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
definitely be intentional about

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,940
everything what are the culture values

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,690
that you want to have in the community

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:39,060
sustainable success

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:42,220
what goddess Hill won't get us there

00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,960
plan for success plan for the future

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,890
what needs to be changed in order to be

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,870
successful to update to react to the

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,690
amount of adoption that took us by

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,310
surprise but we adopted and we change

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,850
and we were open mind about what needs

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,770
to change and how we move forward and I

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,050
know for sure that everything we are

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,700
planning for the next deal will again

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,410
have to change assuming we'll be

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,930
successful in two years and three years

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,850
and that's how product is how software

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:16,450
is how technology is everything changes

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:19,300
also around us the last point is

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,870
diversity I didn't talk about it before

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,300
within my slide being a female leader in

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,650
tech it's not easy to talk about

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:33,460
diversity but I think that as leaders we

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:35,860
all must talk about diversity so my ask

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,530
from all of you is to be intentional

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,280
about that build communities with

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,110
openness that are welcoming people so my

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,380
personal belief that every project every

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,160
team every product will benefit from a

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,779
diverse team the unique thing about open

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,359
source

00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,269
that it is in the reach of everybody no

00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,119
matter your age where which country you

00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:02,580
live in or your gender you can all be

00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,309
part of something amazing and it's

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,099
really a platform of opportunities for

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,809
everybody and I think for all of us it's

00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,540
really an opportunity to make this a

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:19,460
better world so thank you

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:19,460
