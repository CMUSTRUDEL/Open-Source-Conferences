	Keynote: Congratulations, Kubernetes! - Chen Goldberg, Director of Engineering, Google Cloud

Congratulations, Kubernetes!

W00t! With the risk of sounding cliche graduation is a very exciting time, it marks both an ending and a beginning. Looking back on my journey with Kubernetes, I have memories of significant milestones for this project like establishing a release cadance and announcing the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program. There were key lessons along the way, with learning opportunities at every turn. Join me as I talk through some of the most memorable memories and what I have learned from them.
