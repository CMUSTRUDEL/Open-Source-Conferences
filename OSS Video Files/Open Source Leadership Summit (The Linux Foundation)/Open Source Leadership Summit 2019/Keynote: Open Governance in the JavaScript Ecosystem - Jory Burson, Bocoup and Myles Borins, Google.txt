we have some amazing new has everyone

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:10,410

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,480
this one thing the node if you use any

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,460
kind of NPM package or any you know web

pack babble anything these are like the

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,220
unsung heroes of code today in my

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,250
opinion but there is like gajillions

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,189
I think we sing rather well exactly

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,570

miles

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:54,600
good morning Jory yeah we don't have a

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,760
clicker nope no I'm not sure

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,100
perfect I was gonna try clapping if I

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,760
can find it so Jory what do all of these

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,560
projects have in common well um they all

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,290
have really cool logos that's true

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,200
they're all JavaScript projects mm-hmm

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,590
as of today they're all part of the new

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:24,420
open jazz foundation we're really

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,130
excited to announce this work with the

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,790
J's foundation and then nodejs

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,189
foundation joining forces and you know

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,049
as said by the white the very wise Spice

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,409
Girls you know when two foundations

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,860
become one you become a new thing and

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,450
we're looking at what was the Jas

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,720
Foundation and what was the node.js

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,340
foundation coming together to build

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,930
something bigger and for both of our

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,590
organizations we had different reasons

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,899
to do this that's right so for the Jas

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,030
foundation and our projects node is a

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,740
really important tool in the ecosystem

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,740
and it's community is a pretty

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,899
invaluable resource so we really thought

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,310
that the opportunity to organize and

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,310
collaborate with this community much

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,229
closer was just immensely appealing and

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,140
the opportunity to try to bring in some

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,470
of those fresh new contributors to the

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,390
No

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,300
from the nodejs developer community and

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,280
to our projects was quite quite a big

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,630
benefit and no picture of the JSE

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,340
ecosystem is complete without node and

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,960
from the node.js perspective we wanted

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,850
to participate in a multi project

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,740
foundation we had tried to do this

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,660
before within our own foundation through

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,880
an incubation process and we're not

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,250
super successful we also wanted to share

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,350
and refine some of best practices in

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,290
nodejs we've done a lot of work on open

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,060
governance as well as new ways of being

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,800
transparent in meetings and in

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,240
communication we wanted to take some of

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,670
these best practices and share them with

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,900
other projects and most importantly we

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,150
wanted to find a sustainable approach

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,540
and bro the foundation that can outlast

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,010
a project you know as Jim mentioned note

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,980
is used in a lot of places right now a

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,810
lot of like mission critical software

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,030
but we don't know that that will be

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,290
forever and so you know things are very

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,360
great for node right now and we should

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,370
use those resources to rise the tide for

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,080
everyone but also set up a foundation

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,910
that means when those resources aren't

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,990
necessarily coming to node we're not

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,940
going to have to worry about how we're

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,830
going to keep the lights on and maintain

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,780
things at a later date so we're

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,210
definitely trying to come together to be

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,010
more than the sum of our parts the open

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,620
Jas foundation is going to leverage the

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,870
both the best of both the Jas Foundation

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,430
and the node foundations drawing from

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,920
the collective experience of our

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,650
communities and continue to serve those

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,650
communities plus new ones whether you

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,720
are using Emacs or vs code tab spaces

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,150
what-have-you and so we want to go

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,470
through really quickly some of the

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,470
mission objectives of the new foundation

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,560
so of course first we want to promote

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,120
the widespread adoption and continued

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,070
development of JavaScript and web

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,959
solutions in order to hopefully present

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,840
a really unified front and message about

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,430
the impact and value of JavaScript based

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,440
technology on enterprise technology

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,060
stacks

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,590
we also exist to facilitate

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,390
collaboration within the JavaScript

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,830
developer community we're all building

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,209
on each other we're all depending on

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,660
each other and we need to think about

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,400
this collectively and together

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,950
we want to create a center of gravity

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,900
for open source projects bringing them

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,240
all together to work on best practices

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,130
around open governance around how we

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,740
build diverse inclusive and really

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:39,060
healthy developer communities over the

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,680
long term we also exist to enable open

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,270
and accessible web through the

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,340
advancement of projects and strategic

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,380
partnerships it goes without saying that

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,480
every single project that was is within

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,190
this foundation really really cares

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,530
deeply about the open web and what it

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,210
means as a powerful technology for

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,500
empowering individuals around this world

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,400
and we're committed to making it better

00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,400
than it is today

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,560
so I'm getting here was really not an

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,090
easy task at all even though the idea to

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,830
bring these groups together had been

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,140
hanging in the air for for years and

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,330
years the real energy behind coming

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,820
together came together at the open

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,010
source Leadership Summit last year to

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,380
sort of figure out the feasibility the

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,420
the wisdom of such a move and so we

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,000
proceeded with some due diligence and

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,710
brought our communities together fairly

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,590
quickly after the merger announcement

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,880
which occurred in October of 2018 to

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,310
start learning from each other

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,620
to start imagining the possibilities and

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,840
and creating some ideas for what a joint

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,370
foundation could really look like and

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,550
that really started to pick up the pace

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,510
at our collaborator summit but at node

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,330
and Jas interactive so as Joey was

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,320
mentioning you know this merger or like

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,490
whether or not there should be two

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,900
foundations was something that was

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,240
talked about for a while it was

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,690
definitely a huge topic for those of us

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,550
who were at the summit last year and by

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,980
October though it's like how do you turn

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,420
that idea between a handful of active

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,390
collaborators and board members into a

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,100
thing that has community buy-in and what

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,560
we did is we ran weekly community merge

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,360
meetings and it was every Monday with

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,890
alternating times this was so that we

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,330
could be open to various time zones in

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,470
the morning meetings we would have

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,720
people from Asia and Africa

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,310
participating as well as Europe and in

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,110
the afternoons the people from the

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,400
Pacific Standard time zone who didn't

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
want to wake up at 6:00 a.m. were able

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,060
to come and participate to all the

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,890
meetings were live streamed they were

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,540
recorded on YouTube with collaborative

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,490
note-taking and Google Docs that were

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,170
eventually archived into the repo where

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,400
we were doing all this work the

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,750
attendance to these meetings

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,990
range from ten to thirty people a week

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,100
which included members of both boards

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,930
leaders of all the various projects

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,270
within foundation as well as just

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,830
collaborators who are interested in the

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,310
process or had questions about very

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,050
particular bits as was necessary as well

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,120
we would spin up ad hoc meetings to dig

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,699
into very particular contentious subject

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,020
matter because even with a weekly

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,330
cadence sometimes the whole meeting

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,639
could be derailed about one thing that

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,050
people didn't agree about but overall

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,840
doing this and doing this in a very

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,370
transparent and recorded way meant that

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,110
like I would go and talk to people about

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,580
hey you know we're doing this thing

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,050
would you like to join and they would be

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,760
like oh we've been following it the

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,620
whole time and it was really interesting

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,789
to be talking to people and try to get

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,410
them updated and they'd be like no we've

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,260
already followed the whole thing you

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,320
don't need to don't worry about it

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,360
and so another big part of that getting

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,860
consensus and making sure everybody was

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,510
on the same page about agreement was

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,750
coming up with a staging process which

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,460
we borrowed from the tc39 s staging

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,110
process for their proposals for things

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,699
that go into the language this really

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,460
helped us make sure that our ideas were

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,139
getting refined that we were kind of

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,300
coming to further and further agreement

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,340
as we we moved along and kept everybody

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,919
on the same page about the status of

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,110
different ideas as as we proceeded with

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,090
work we can then tag different issues

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,389
for further discussion outside the

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,979
meeting or to meet together again in the

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,229
meeting and say yes we've all kind of

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:05,039
come to agreement let's advance this to

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:07,470
the next stage we also made sure to be

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,150
doing constant feedback so we had lots

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,470
of email updates that were going to the

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,419
various committees even though they were

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,590
invited to every single meeting terms of

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,570
people don't show up to every meeting

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,159
that they're invited to so we made sure

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,050
that the people who had a vested

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,099
interest and where things were going had

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,110
constant updates

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,030
we also would hold ad-hoc meetings just

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,800
for those groups and we also held

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,570
multiple townhall sessions which were

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,220
actually turning into a regular

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,020
occurrence within the foundation where

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,909
not only where all the projects asked to

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,440
join but anyone from the community could

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:37,110
participate in ask questions and this

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,940
similarly was broadcast live on YouTube

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,450
and is recorded and archived and people

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,800
can dig it up and watch it in the future

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,360
so and here's a quick look at the

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,620
resulting governance structure that came

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,640
out of all of these conversations

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,950
and we have a cross project council that

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,530
sort of helps coordinate all the

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,510
activities across different projects and

00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,820
it kind of becomes the place where

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,560
conversations about project needs

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,570
special programs that really benefit

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,050
projects come together as well as your

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,690
standard board entity that works on sort

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,910
of the legal mumbo-jumbo that we may or

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,910
may not really care to hear about and in

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,220
our individual projects and one of the

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,870
things that i'm particularly proud that

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,640
we came to conclusion on this is the

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,080
cross project council will actually the

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,970
meetings will be open to any member of

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,230
any foundation project to come and

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,390
participate fully in the plant consensus

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,160
seeking model in there so if we want to

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,600
add new projects to the foundation we

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,910
need to reach consensus within the cross

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
project council now if contestants if

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,180
consensus can't be reached there's going

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
to be a small peer group of voting

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,590
members who can break times when we

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,820
don't have consensus but if you want to

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,070
do something like bring in a new project

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,080
or make major changes or figure out

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,970
where budget goes if we need to be

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,290
working together this ensures that not

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,210
only can we work together but we're

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,500
doing it in a gala terian way and we're

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,820
not creating unnecessary power

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,040
structures that are gonna stop our

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,020
growth and there's a lot of reasons why

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,270
this rocks

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,760
that open participation I'm a huge fan

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,590
of the projects can also keep their

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,710
current process with Jory can speak to

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,270
from the jsf side right so with 28

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,890
projects coming in from the Jas

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,540
foundation everybody works a little bit

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,030
differently some are small projects that

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,190
just have one main project maintainer

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,530
with a few helpers others are much

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,360
bigger so we needed to be flexible in

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,680
terms of allowing projects to bring what

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,070
works for them into this new

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,140
organization another thing that was

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,030
really important about this was allowing

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,060
projects the flexibility to move between

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,190
stages as they mature as their needs

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,680
change as they go throughout their

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,990
project lifecycle this this pattern

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,260
really helped give them the flexibility

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,940
that they needed to be successful so I

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,140
think it goes without saying that the

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,240
future is pretty cool and we're pretty

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,400
excited about it there's still some work

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,840
that we need to do the CPC hasn't been

00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,070
officially formed yet so we're going to

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,750
be bootstrapping that and getting that

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,700
going we have an executive director

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,360
search so hey anyone in the audience

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,209
come find

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,110

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:08,820
we may want to talk to you there's some

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,769
housekeeping that we need to do as well

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,000
to get everything in order

00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,860
and we're going to be having an all

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,740

we'd love for you to come help us craft

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,870
the future of the open J's foundation

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,120

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,480
so please come join us we're live at

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,279
open JSF org also if you're really

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,260
intrigued to learn more about how we ran

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,360
this process which was pretty wild and

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,279
pretty awesome we are going to do an

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,649
unconference session on Thursday at 2:30

in the montero room so we can get into a

00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,640
little bit more of the nitty-gritty and

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,620

tell if you're in the audience right now

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,899
but a huge vision and driving force

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,470
between doing this from the beginning

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,089

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,339
Board of Directors of course all of our

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,000
project communities which were really

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,430
integral and feedback gathering process

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,870

right now and of course all the various

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839

so I want to just I love this project

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:51,540
you know not to name-drop here but I was

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,910
talking to Vince Cerf backstage at a

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,470
concert or both more time it's trying to

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,850
big-time damage he said something really

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,570
interesting that you have just

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,980
demonstrated which is the ITF the w3c

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,660
kind of all these like iconic

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,370
institutions we think of today he said

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,860
you know we kind of created these

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,010
institutions as we needed them and

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,339
literally that's exactly what you've

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,899
done I just love

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,720
see how you've like worked with the

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,819
community created this process you're

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,309
like the modern version of these you

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:22,749
know you people who worked on the

00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:25,120
foundation of a lot of internet

00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:26,649
technology creating institutions as we

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,730
needed that so it's just amazing work

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,730
