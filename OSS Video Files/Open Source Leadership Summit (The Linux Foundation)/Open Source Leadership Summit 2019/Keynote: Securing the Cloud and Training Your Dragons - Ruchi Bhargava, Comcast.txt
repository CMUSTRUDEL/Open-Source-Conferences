good afternoon so I guess I am between

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:11,280
you and lunch but I'll make sure that I

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,860
make it value-add as well as you know

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,289
talk about application security and how

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,510
in open source projects

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,449
you could play take the same playbook

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,000
which we are trying to use at Comcast

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,710
and one of the responsibilities which I

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,920
have at Comcast is to drive cloud

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,099
security and that's the focus of my talk

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,290
today so one question and I hope the

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,920
answer is different than Jim's question

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,690
on Oscars how many of you have seen any

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,329
of the movies How to Train Your Dragon

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,520
or read the book ok more than three so

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:52,500
so you know and how is this relevant to

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,800
my talk here so training this movie is

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,440
actually a tale about three things

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,180
growing up maturing and how is that

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,420
relevant to us maturing with respect to

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,240
developing our cloud solutions and

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,430
deploying them securely

00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,070
the second aspect of this movie is about

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,979
finding the courage to face the unknowns

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,439
and that's about preparing for dealing

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,930
with security issues in the cloud as we

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,790
develop and deploy them and the third

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,430
part which is actually a very important

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,830
part of this movie which you know kids

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,409
really take away from it is how nothing

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,900
can ever train us to let go and that's

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,420
about governance in the cloud and you

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,380
know when this movie was coming out I

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,829
think the third in the sequel and the

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,100
trilogy so far was released on February

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,710
22nd when I was putting together my

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,990
topic stuff for this presentation and I

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,579
thought it was very relevant to the

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,250
world of cloud security so what we

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,130
started our approach in cloud security

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,409
was about two years ago and we looked at

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,439
we started looking at trends and I think

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,659
these trends are very relevant from any

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,869
applications whether it is in open

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,270
source or in any proprietary our public

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,510
cloud implementation

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,300
and the first chart which we look here

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,940
here is about total IT infrastructure

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,800
spends whether you have data center

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,930
storage the traditional data centers or

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,020
the public and private cloud and this

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,630
year it's forecasted that the public and

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,580
private cloud spent will go will

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,820
overtake the traditional data center

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:37,070
spend and so basically the story here is

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:41,090
cloud is important it's more relevant

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,740
right second part about is when you

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,830
deploy in the cloud what are the

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,780
challenges so when we look at the survey

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,970
though you know it's a I think this one

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:55,010
is from right scale survey where they

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,750
asked what are significant challenges

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,000
and somewhat of a challenge to the

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,070
various enterprises and if you look

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,290
security is at the top along with

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,630
managing cloud resources building a

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,510
private cloud deploying it but security

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,250
was considered as a top challenge and it

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,860
continues to be a top concern for

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,530
everybody deploying in the cloud the

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,980
third part is about challenges which is

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,100
related to maturity you know as you

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,050
begin security was one of the you know

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,450
largest concerns for people who were

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,820
deploying in the cloud as you become an

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,310
intermediate category of maturity it

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,320
becomes kind of less but still not the

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,470
very end and then as you become an

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,890
advanced deployer of cloud technology it

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,750
becomes again of pretty high like

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,290
concern because of scalability issues

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,180
etc so for us all three you know

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,240
managing cause security and compliance

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,310
being in the Internet service provider

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,480
industry that was very important and we

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,690
don't want to be in the news for the

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,910
wrong reasons so we had to come up with

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,470
an approach internally and you know like

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,100
all engineers we took a six pronged

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,380
approach you know you had to have a

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,750
method to the madness so we used a

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,490
industry standard framework and I'll go

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,220
over into each of these six prongs and

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,430
in a little bit of detail but the six

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,130
prongs are user framework to identify

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,190
where we are and what are the gaps and

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,950
we used the NIST framework which is very

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,130
appropriate for the from the word

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,500
security we defined overall reference

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,480
architecture which will make everybody

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,000
in the world whether their product

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,860
developers application developers or the

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,770
cloud architecture and deployment teams

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,480
the sre teams they will you know we all

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,480
have a common language to talk about and

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,900
then we take that security framework and

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,600
architecture and deploy a soar which

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,730
takes all the events and then

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,140
orchestrates security actions and then

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,560
we have to be prepared for security

00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:00,280
events because come what me however

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,530
large you're an automation tool set P

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,290
however prepared you are

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,370
you'll never be prepared for any you

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,040
know you have to be prepared for the

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,800
security events and with this tooling

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,480
that we develop we made sure that we are

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,670
going to work with the development teams

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,680
to embed it in their CIC be pipelines as

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,170
you know we heard in the open source

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,480
world there are thousands and thousands

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,820
of say ICD pipelines and even in within

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,070
comcast we have several CI CD pipelines

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,260
and all of this could not be done and

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,850
cannot be done without uplifting the

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,860
skill sets of a traditional

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,500
cybersecurity organization you know

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,660
we've had the cyber you know we we are a

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,060
50 year old company we've had a security

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,830
organization for several years but with

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,110
the cloud implementations with our

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,580
developers using the cloud we have to

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,470
change their mindset and how do we

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,350
uplift their skills so that's our

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,530
overall approach and I'm going to go you

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,600
know in details with that so the

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,640
framework that we used was the NIST

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,860
framework which consists of the identify

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,990
protect detect respond and recover all

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,370
of you may be familiar some of you may

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,950
be familiar with this it's a pretty

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,890
standard framework and then we took a

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,410
you know assessment of where we are you

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,810
know we had a lot of manual processes

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,330
which you know come to hand when we have

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,610
security incidents or you know we do our

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,380
governance in the cloud and we had

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,870
started off or on our automation journey

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,970
so the Box on the top talks about the

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,010
automation that we've done and the Box

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,990
on the bottom is manual processes not

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,600
everything needs to be automated but

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,220
those are the areas where we have you

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,830
know we are a heavy user of AWS we

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,630
have openstack we have Cloud Foundry we

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,520
have kubernetes we have a lot of

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,590
open-source software which is deployed

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,640
we have a lot of public clouds which are

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,830
proprietary which are deployed so and we

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,900
created a backlog of where we want to be

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,150
in the future so this is the food in the

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,210
all the yellow stuff is where we want to

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,560
be in the future and you know and we've

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,170
already started on this journey from

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,430
last year and you know some of the

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,810
things which you will see around the

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,120
detect piece we had we were using AWS as

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,570
guard duty and then cloud check or cloud

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,130
trail all these eventing mechanisms

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,200
which will help us detect what the

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,340
issues are but we also started using

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,110
Netflix's security monkey which was you

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,300
know deployed earlier but you were not

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,270
really using it but we you know did all

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,560
a cost and risk analysis and we said ok

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,290
we're going to use security monkey

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,810
moving forward and then feed it into our

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,290
the sim databases as well as the

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:41,160
security orchestration and automation

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:43,850
response tools the source and we are you

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,990
know debating how we do the automatic

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,450
automated remediation using the

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,479
automation that we are doing because it

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,570
should not break something else and if

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,660
you look you know the world of security

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:02,120
in our organization we show we are

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:06,270
choosing not to make it you know

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,280
constraining very protective method of

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,050
security but we are trying to make it

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,760
more reactive and when we say reactive

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,890
it's not in a negative way we give the

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,070
power to our developers and we want them

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,570
to be able to take you know give them

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,190
the power to do the right use the

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,490
services in the public cloud or the

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:26,040
private cloud however teach them get

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,510
them certified on security principles so

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,850
that they don't make the mistakes and

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,370
then we have tooling which will detect

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,050
any issues as they come forward so if I

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,200
move to the next slide it talks about

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,270
that architecture so what we do here is

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,770
you know you have all the event sources

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,260
I talked about in the previous slide

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:47,550
about you know a cloud check or a guard

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,810
duty cloud watch all these events are

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:53,330
basically going to feed it

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:56,010
to normalize a set of event you know

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,970
principles which will normalize against

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,980
any misconfigured databases or any

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,200
issues which could cause security

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,580
incidents then we correlate them to

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,370
other events which have occurred in the

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,250
past and then create a reaction which

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,950
may have notifications or may need some

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,510
automatic remediations and we also will

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,920
create dashboards and this is

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,290
architecture which we are working

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,540
towards we've got some parts of it

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:26,310
implemented and you know we see great

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:29,190
promise in this and all these events as

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,529
they collect you know sim and soar are

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,750
very standard industry standard terms

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,390
soar is relatively new it was created by

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,230
Gartner a couple of years ago but the

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,779
first set of three boxes is about events

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,120
which come out of our cloud

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,960
implementations and whether it's Amazon

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,740
or its

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,540
Asscher or OpenStack or VMware you know

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,150
we've got all you name it and we've got

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,970
it and we collect them into a sim

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,550
depository correlate them and then we

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,660
send them to a source system and the

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,150
source system today is mostly homegrown

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,240
automation but we are now going to be

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,390
using the mesto which is a capability

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,440
that we are integrating with and that

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,720
helps us make our operations more

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,970
effective efficient and more you know

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,790
brings better quality into it and you

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,890
know sims correlated it tells you what

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,710
the problem is but the soul helps you

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,170
you know the traditional world soul was

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,270
done mostly manually and now with the

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,010
automation you can do it much faster and

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,860
make it more efficient and we don't want

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,030
the you know with a reactive

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,450
architecture you know when we are

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,830
finding issues we don't want the

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,150
traditional security organization to

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,070
take their time to react

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:51,709
so with soar you can react much more

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:54,180
quickly so now that we are prepared for

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,770
you know with all the tooling we need to

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,800
be preparing for our security events

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,810
this is one of the pictures from the how

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,310
to train your dragon so I have since I

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,080
was talking with

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,540
topic I had to take a picture from there

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,750
and DreamWorks is a Comcast company so

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,930
there's that plug for them so you know

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,830
with all the tooling that you may have

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,360
with all the automation with all the

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,420
guardrails that we may build that's all

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,370
technology you need to have some sort of

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,990
processes some interactions between the

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,930
various parts of the organization which

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,640
deal with the technology so the cloud

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,680
Center of Excellence which consists is

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,330
the virtual construct which consists of

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,570
people from the cloud architecture team

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,490
the cloud SRE team and the security team

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,380
and the network team they are the people

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,029
who actually run the cloud and keep it

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,500
running securely then you have the

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,080
product teams the developers who are

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,350
actually developing our Comcast a set of

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,060
products and they use up they use our

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,800
infrastructure through whether it's

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Amazon or aw or Azure or you know any of

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,270
the private cloud implementations that

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,029
we have but in case of an incident

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,350
that's we all need to come together we

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,660
have a product security incident

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,000
response team which works with you know

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,730
the researchers in the security world

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,080
they contact us or through our bug

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,720
bounty program or through any other

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,420
research and analysis that they've done

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,970
they bring those issues to us to the

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,080
cease cloud center of excellence or to

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,850
the product teams and then we work

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,140
together and then we have a threat

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,970
intelligence team which needs to work

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,020
together which is the security forensics

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,730
and of course AWS or Microsoft or you

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,460
know the community when it's OpenStack

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,110
and of course the first line of support

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,920
is a security fusion center where we

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,890
respond you know at the fastest process

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,060
so in all six of these bodies need to

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:50,610
work together and that's where we are

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,800
you know where in order to work together

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,839
training needs to occur we've been

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,640
working with the methodology that we've

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
developed over the years but with

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,690
especially with the architecture that we

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,370
are deploying and the automation that we

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,440
are deploying if you're not able to use

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,339
it we will be still using the same old

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,110
method of communications calling and

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,000
sending emails to the folks when an

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,990
issue arises so we wanted to make it

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,080
much more faster

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,760
recovery to the issues that we see so

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,230
that's where we are prepared for the

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,760
security incidents now once we as I said

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,190
we've got the tooling we've got the

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,170
process how do we make sure that that

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,839
developers are building things right so

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,300
we want to embed all the tooling into

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,089
their CI CV pipelines become a component

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,880
of their test gauntlet so you know

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:44,040
whether when they're doing the unit

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,980
development you will see that the

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,600
security scanning is part of the

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,450
gauntlet and when they're making the

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,250
final release again security scans and

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,660
assessments are part of the full

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,160
security scan the part of the gauntlet

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,800
so we're working with the various

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,480
product teams to ensure that security is

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:07,380
part of the developer lifecycle and then

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,209
you know we know that security training

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,620
is important for our works cloud

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,660
training is important for our security

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,640
workforce and even in the industry if

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,610
you look that the infrastructure

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,700
headcount changes with respect to

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,550
hosting storage network hosting in the

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,310
cloud as well as security security is

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,310
pretty much at the top then so many new

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,380
people are joining the industry and not

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,240
all of them are trained to work on

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,610
security principles not all of them are

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,079
trained to work in the cloud so we need

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,300
to uplift the skills of our workforce

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,630
and that has been a huge focus and I

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,010
think whether you're working on in an

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,720
industry where you're developing

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,339
products or you are working in the

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,410
open-source community it's fairly

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,430
important to uplift the skills and keep

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,790
that keep it going

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,990
and bringing it back together that's

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,760
where we have you know you bring it back

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,820
together with the Train training of

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,950
people is the most important and

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,600
developing the tooling it's you know the

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:12,390
building blocks of getting it together

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:15,300
so that's when you're our character

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,029
who's the main character in the movie is

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,130
got all it against strained and take

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:24,709
ready to take off and deal with the

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,709
world of security and that's what I have

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,680
