	Keynote: The Power of Open Source in a 5G World - Mazin Gilbert, Vice President of Advanced Technology and Systems, AT&T Labs

The advent of 5G promises to transform our lives in a huge way. This revolution will transform cars to be self-driving, communication networks to be software-defined and autonomous, VR and AR to be mobile and completely untethered, and IoT sensors to be intelligent and connected. Behind this 5G revolution, open source is critical in expediting the design, planning, development and delivery of the 5G vision. AI, SDN, Edge Cloud and Disaggregated RAN all play a significant role in the planning, forecasting, building, development and deployment of 5G. This presentation will provide an overview of the power of open source, and specifically ONAP, Acumos, ORAN, and Akraino, in creating a 5G world. Mazin will highlight how developments and interoperability across these projects will help to speed the adoption of 5G-based applications for both consumers and enterprises.

well good morning all right what a

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,170
beautiful place huh couldn't believe it

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,200
when I was driving here yesterday wow

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,570
what have you've never been here before

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,059
I want to talk to you about something

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,550
that's really exciting that's going to

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,529
really impact all of us whether you're a

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,710
developer part of a small company part

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,949
of a big company whatever you are then

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,250
the next few years 5g is going to impact

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,439
you personally and your business and I

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,219
want to talk about so what what does it

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,000
mean this this era of 5g and where does

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,059
open-source come into this let me start

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,969
by this is probably a Slav you've seen

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,850
it before just to give you an idea of of

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,149
how this this story of going to software

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,120
and open-source started for us at AT&T

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:57,300
about four or five years ago when when

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,430
we deploy the iPhone in 2007 in the

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,800
first ten years of the deployment of the

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,549
iPhone our traffic increased by three

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,680
hundred sixty thousand percent majority

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,290
of our traffic - actually more than 50%

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,790
of our traffic today is video the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,479
traffic certainly has changed quite

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,470
dramatically and every day we carry this

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:23,159
is data as of February 2000 nineteen we

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,979
carried 242 petabytes of data daily huge

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,080
amount of data and we saw that coming

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,689
few years ago and what we did about this

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,990
is to start really disagree getting our

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,210
network into a control layer and in a

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,380
data layer we started sort of moving

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,869
sort of the software and the hardware

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,899
and trying to understand how to use

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,880
software not just to scale our network

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,250
more efficiently but to program our

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,409
network so we started building a spark

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,899
on that called EECOM and three four

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,759
years later we worked with Jim and our

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,700
pit and decide you know what we want to

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,020
partner with the Linux Foundation

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,719
partner with a number of companies China

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,270
Mobile and many other vendors to really

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,810
put that into open source and today it's

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,090
we have a very thriving own app

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,069
ecosystem of over a hundred companies

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,709
under the Linux Foundation networking

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,689
umbrella

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,040
this has really helped us significantly

00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:19,689
today at AT&T we've deployed own app

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,920
this is an open-source we've deployed at

00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:28,420
AT&T and we've actually by the end of

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,459
2018 we passed sixty-five percent of our

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,120
network being virtualized our target

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,900
network at AT&T 65% virtualized today

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,500
managed by this orchestration platform

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,920
this is great

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,109
so what's next we're starting to see big

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,109
shifts we're starting to see a shift

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:50,109
also not in just now traffic but in the

00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:53,439
devices we're going to more smartphone

00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:56,859
devices and we are expected to have an

00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,709
explosion of IOT devices or explosion

00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:03,250
you know up due to the 5g an explosion

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:05,500
of the M to M and M to X well this mean

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,540
is that that little device that you

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,879
probably have in your house it could be

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,769
a toothbrush or whatever we'll probably

00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,409
have the intelligence of your smartphone

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,780
today that a couple of dollars maybe a

00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,599
dollar even we are talking about well if

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,329
that toothbrush has the smart the

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,220
smartness of your smartphone today can I

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,739
collect data and send that data to your

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,790
dentist if they're you know to tell them

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,949
whether there's something wrong with

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,449
your teeth or they have cavities etc

00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,979
we're not far away from that we're

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,250
actually two three years away from that

00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,470
with 5g basically coming in it's it's

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,049
all going to be basically possible so as

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,090
an explosion shift in the types of

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,189
devices and the number of devices that

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,500
are going to be that we will have to

00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:49,359
connect in the network and the current

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,340
approach that we have today is really

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:56,019
not going to scale to allow us to

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,379
support that the type of data is also

00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:02,560
changing we started many years ago with

00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:06,310
just text and that's gone to voice to

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,159
images to video and with 5g we're

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,810
expecting a huge part of the traffic is

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,889
going to be virtual reality augmented

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:18,039
reality video 360 etc starting from text

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:22,240
this data explosion is about 50 thousand

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:24,159
times and that 50 thousand times is not

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,150
something you can grow a network by 50

00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,900
thousand times

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,160
just in a span of about 10-15 years so

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,190
we're starting to look at that so well

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,009
how is the network going to support this

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,850
change this explosion of data and the

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,350
shift in the devices and the data most

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,699
of you have seen the evolution of the

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,270
network okay

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:49,539
1g you can support you know two to four

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,180
kilohertz kilobits per second you know

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,970
we use that too it's analog we can

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,970
basically transmit voice with that then

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,250
we went to 2g and with 2g now you've

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,070
gone into not just voice you can

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,500
actually do some rudimentary data now

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,080
you can have 10 to probably 14 kilobits

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,639
per second and now you can start

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,310
something doing some some rudimentary

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:20,380
texting and voice and then you go to you

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:23,320
go to 3G and in 3G we started seeing

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,650
sort of a movement from voice and data

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,530
to doing more data than we've ever done

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,789
before we can probably support something

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,199
like 2 3 megabits per second of data but

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,349
really the big revolution really

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,599
happened with 4G and that data became

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,919
video and that really gave birth to a

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,260
lot of companies that even in existence

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,630
today we would never be able to do

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,389
streaming video as one example if it

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,720
wasn't a 4G and LTE and I think what

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,659
you're seeing in the 5 g this is really

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,960
a paradigm shift and this is why 5g is

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:01,180
so important because when you really put

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,360
together 5g and what we heard earlier

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,909
today about edge compute you put that

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,400
smartness at the edge and you increase

00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:12,090
the speed of the access really what you

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,710
end up with a real-time network

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,380
what does that mean a real-time network

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,110
means that you can now do the compute

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,510
the intelligence the processing in the

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,060
network just as fast as you can have it

00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,180
in the device you have an enormous large

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,460
amounts of intelligence sitting just at

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,430
your fingertips wherever you are and

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:37,060
that's why this is really a big deal

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,250
5g sort of allow us to operate at

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,050
spectrum

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,550
and we've talked about millimeter-wave

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,400
spectrum what does that mean is that

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,750
you're now operating a spectrum about 24

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,430
Giga Hertz per second gigahertz or above

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,310
that kind of spectrum that kind of

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,200
frequencies really allow us to do so

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,820
sort of this tremendous bandwidth in

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,430
that type of frequencies and so you see

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,460
us moving towards 5g a millimeter wave

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,210
very quickly as we deploy 5g and a scale

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,430
globally this also means that latency is

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,580
going to be reduced we're talking about

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,740
one to two millisecond latency for 5g

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,100
and now when you can marry that with

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,560
edge compute and really trying to put

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,420
GPUs and other high-performance computer

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,380
at the edge then you're looking at

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,540
ground speed round-trip type of compute

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,630
and processing of something like maybe

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,520
10 to 20 milliseconds now compare that

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,740
with a hundred to 200 milliseconds that

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,630
you'll basically get today and that

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,570
really trying to drive a paradigm shifts

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,770
in the type of application you can run

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,140
now some of these applications are

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,120
pretty obvious autonomous vehicles

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,120
autonomous vehicles can never be

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,430
scalable and mainstream without really

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,610
the advent of 5g and edge compute

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,979
without that real-time network to be

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,250
able to collapse and process data across

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,220
multiple cars and do it right in real

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,169
time to avoid crash to you know manage

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,320
the traffic you need that real-time

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:10,229
network all the way to autonomous drones

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,100
we started the trial autonomous drones

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:16,890
without a captain and with video

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,570
capability that can help us we were

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,540
talking about AI earlier today jim was

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,729
having a session on AI well we're

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,890
applying ai in the network today in the

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,290
network and one place we're applying it

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:31,260
we are feeding drones with visual

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,229
capabilities to go up and tell us

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,510
whether our cells have a problem or not

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,810
whether there is dirts one of the number

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,280
one problem with all cell sites is dirt

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,530
okay basically to tell us whether we

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,620
need to maintain the cell side or not

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:49,770
now remember we have 75 just us we have

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,400
about 75 80 thousand macro cells and

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,170
that's going

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,930
hundreds of thousands of small cells as

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,570
you go to 5g five g's of paradigm shifts

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,370
from these macro big cells to very small

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,910
cells that you can pretty much position

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,120
every mile or two so an explosion the

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,010
type of applications so what does this

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,230
mean to what we've done over the past

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,060
few years as we've brought to this to

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,820
this level is that we've gone to

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,290
software we are now a big advocate of

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,020
software we use a lot of software

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,620
actually in AT&T we counted in the past

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,540
two years we have contributed 10 million

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,420
lines of software just in two years

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,940
which is quite astonishing for a company

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,070
certainly like AT&T which is a very

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,680
traditional telecom communication

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,320
company these are the software's we're

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,330
starting to use today in building 5g and

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,610
today I'm not gonna go into a lot of the

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,080
details as to how and why but I'll just

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,730
give you a little glimpse of what's

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,680
going on if you're not familiar with

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,440
some of those software you're probably

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,460
familiar with the open status is what we

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,410
use for cloud compute you know for a lot

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,760
of our cloud compute technologies and

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,550
this is what we have deploy in our cloud

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,700
zones at AT&T today airship is what we

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,770
use for the management of these cloud

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,400
services and it's based on kubernetes

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:15,000
and then you get Danis is something we

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,920
announced last year and this is sort of

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,290
think of it as your network operating

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,060
system for white boxes and this is

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,220
something very vital to us because as we

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,480
start thinking of the edge the edge is

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,120
not just some clouds zones sitting few

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,550
miles away the edge could also be where

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,710
your customer is where your factory is

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,960
where your retail store is so we're

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,280
starting to deploy a lot of these white

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,030
boxes with a network operating system

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,250
called daños here

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:48,270
Orion you're gonna hear a lot of about

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:51,240
around so Oh rad is a well-defined

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,700
foundation it's led by a number of

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,810
operators and a number of vendors are

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,670
part of that and the goal of Orion is to

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,440
really to disaggregate durán and drive

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,270
interoperability you'll hear more about

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,720
that in the next month

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,630
so a crane Oh is a is one of those

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,870
capabilities we're using in building the

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:18,270
edge for us as a team we found that with

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:20,520
one of our most challenging tasks AT&T

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,340
when we are building these multiple ad

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,010
zones is integrating the technologies so

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,340
crane o is about how do you basically

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,130
Drive and and the integration of edge

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,810
technologies in a way that we could sort

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,830
of test and deploy as a cookie cutter

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,930
Alchemist is part of the Linux

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,690
Foundation deep learning umbrella we're

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,840
using acumen in building analytic and

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,990
predictive capability for the edge in

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,240
figuring out how we can load balanced

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,850
our traffic so we load bounds our

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,410
traffic video traffic and others we have

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,900
to have the predictive capability

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,140
capability to allow us to know which

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,550
cell which carrier do you basically load

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,290
balance your traffic and this is

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,760
basically what we use we use AR

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,250
capability ain't activeness to do

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,250
exactly that an own app is our network

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,290
operating system for the network cloud

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,650
all of these capabilities is what we're

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,630
using today as we are rolling out 5g I

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,010
thought I'll show you the slide and

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,880
you're gonna see more about this slides

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:27,480
moving forward one of the most if you

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,180
want to work on a complex task the big

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,520
complex task to work on is the RAM this

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,950
is really probably I've worked on a lot

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,440
of software and open source I've never

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,510
worked on something as complex as the

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,300
rat and part of that because it's really

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,400
a closed box it requires a lot of

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,980
expertise in data and radio engineering

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,600
and and many other expertise that you

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,750
know it's hard to find one person who

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,160
has all these expertise together and

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:57,390
what we've been doing as part of the o

00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,840
ran consortium is to really break down

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,250
the round into smaller pieces you'll see

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,660
basically at the bottom is your radio

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,570
unit this is the little device that you

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,030
see on top of the tower and today that

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,480
little device is completely connected to

00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,400
a one big box called the BBU and what

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,950
we're doing here is they're opening up

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,130
the box into smaller software

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,500
Jules with open API interoperability and

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,050
standardizing those api's and you can

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,300
see where we're using the open source

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,320
across all of these across that

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,040
basically stack

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,930
what's phenomenon here is latency

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,330
latency is very very important when

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,310
we've been working in own app you know

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,530
operating it about doing a closed loop

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,410
in the order of a second to two seconds

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,810
or even higher it's okay in the network

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,840
you know if you want to identify there's

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,490
a failure in your virtual machine or you

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,530
want to drive traffic from one place to

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,990
another apply a different policy it is

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,330
okay if you're operating at a half a

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,200
second or a second or more but when you

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:03,780
are looking at access really you're now

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,480
talking about 10 to 20 milliseconds for

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,910
a thing doing closed loop within the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,590
deal ECU and and really in the

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,050
sub-millisecond when you're going all

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,300
the way down to the radio units so now

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,340
you know the expertise that you have to

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,630
have is more than software it's more

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,270
than data is you really need to

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:25,260
understand how to manage latency and

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:29,310
speed so this is just another view of

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,800
looking at this is we talk you know at

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,470
AT&T about this concept of edge to edge

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,000
and this is where we are basically all

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,490
that means is that we're placing the

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,380
intelligence there's no one physical

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,940
location for edge so when we talk about

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,190
edge compute we don't talk about one

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,580
place we really talk about many places

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,260
that start with a device all the way to

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,130
the customer premise where we are

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,270
deploying these Y boxes and could be in

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,460
your home and could mean small

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,650
enterprises and then you have the cell

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,810
towers of basically putting some of that

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,940
intelligence your cell towers like I

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,010
said we're going from macro cells to

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,800
micro cells this is the movement towards

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,560
using these millimeter wave spectrum and

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,610
now also placing some of that

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,920
intelligence in these edge clouds being

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,530
in the data centers so this is your SEOs

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,050
your national data centers your regional

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,000
data centers and what we're doing with

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,670
those is that we're starting to push the

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,010
intelligence from not just the device

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,990
itself or what is today is just the

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,880
device itself

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,860
the core cloud the third party cloud

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,720
were starting to redistribute that

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,319
intelligence all across to get the

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,389
optimal speed latency and experience

00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,829
basically that you want to support the

00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,110
SLA that you want to support for the

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,449
application and then you have your

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,490
private cloud and third party cloud and

00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:53,550
you could see where the open-source

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,120
software that we are placing across the

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,370
across the stack from edge to edge one

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,079
thing that we don't talk more a lot

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,449
about and Martin mentioned this in the

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,459
previous talk I know this is a software

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:09,209
conference we talk a lot about open

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:12,810
source okay but really what's also just

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:16,529
as exciting a software and it's so

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,750
important is the data and the reason why

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,420
data is important because for us to

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,110
optimize a new software in an

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,579
intelligent way it's really through data

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,069
and that's why a I is interesting

00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:32,519
because it's all about really bringing

00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:37,050
data and software together to trying to

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,360
do something really magical so we talked

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,620
about 5g you hear a lot of my 5g but one

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,980
thing I want you to get out of my talk

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,139
is when people talk about 5g I won't

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,970
talk about latency and speed and new

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,829
experiences and virtual reality and

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,500
augmented reality and autonomous cars

00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:54,660
this is all good and this is all great

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,790
but I want you to what to remember is

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,990
that the data and the question is that

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,350
we're gonna be we're gonna have an

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,730
explosion of data with 5g and one thing

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,740
that's really exciting for a community

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,020
like us here is that what we're going to

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,260
do with this data what kind of new

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,829
projects we can have in Linux Foundation

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,650
by marrying the data with software I

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,319
want to show you I want to show you a

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,539
video here that tells you a little about

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,780
how we're starting to think about using

00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,780
AI and data in our development of 5g

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,649
oops can you play the video please

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,649
[Music]

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,790
at 18 t we're no stranger to artificial

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,860
intelligence and machine learning we've

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,260
embraced these technologies as valuable

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,360
tools and our ever evolving toolbox and

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:54,010
are leading the way in integrating them

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,990
into our world our next use 5g first AI

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,540
will help us build out our 5g

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,340
infrastructure it maps out where cell

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,620
towers fiber lines and other

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,660
transmitters exist today and can

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,290
pinpoint the best location for 5g

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,930
build-outs

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,870
pairing location and usage information

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,820
will create the most optimal 5g Network

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,830
machine learning and AI will work

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,050
together to keep the 5g network

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,240
maintained and secure by continuously

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,210
monitoring how it's being used and how

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,260
it's responding so if one cell is not

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,870
functioning properly

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,870
ai will signal another tower to pick up

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,390
the slack or if one area is experiencing

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,940
high volume of usage ai will trigger

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,880
lower use cell sites to ensure speed

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:41,260
isn't compromised so what does this mean

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,230
for you an explosion of data a strong

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,380
efficient 5g network built for a mobile

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,940
workforce a world of autonomous vehicles

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,040
near zero lag virtual and augmented

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,880
reality experiences from across the

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,810
globe and truly extraordinary

00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,670
possibilities so we're actually using

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:03,040
open source software today in designing

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,940
our 5g so this is an actual use case is

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,610
that every small cell AT&T puts is not

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,380
based on an army of engineers going out

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,450
and figuring out what to do and talking

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,820
to the town etc it's really based on

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,460
machine learning and AI technology that

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,800
really ingest a large amount of data and

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,980
tells us basically where is the most

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,630
likely place we can put a small cell and

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,040
what the experience is what the

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,860
throughput is and how this is going to

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,630
impact our customers another use case

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,910
that you saw in the video is that now

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,620
you put these small cells in how do you

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,780
make sure your load balance those cells

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,370
the traffic across those cells because

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,650
for those who understand 5g and small

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,530
cells one of the challenges with small

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,900
cells in 5g is the propagation is that

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,310
you have very short propagation and you

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,840
have issues about penetrating

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,740
through walls and glasses and things

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,480
like that so again optimizing that again

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,650
the same type of problem is that we're

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,300
applying some of the open source

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,430
technologies that I mentioned earlier

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,250
and really building more data-driven

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:06,700
type of predictors to tell us how do you

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,380
position the antenna and what angle you

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,440
can position the antenna to get the best

00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,950
experience okay so I mentioned this I'll

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,360
just finish with those two use cases

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,060
we're really very very excited about

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,980
this new paradigm shift with 5g and it's

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,170
really not about 5g it's about bringing

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,180
5g and edge together into this oh you

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,690
know real-time Network it's about

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,370
bringing a AI and pushing AI not in the

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,070
traditional a I'm already pushing AI

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,960
closer and closer to the customer so at

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,600
their fingertips they have really that

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,770
intelligence that compute that power to

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,020
do a lot of things with it whatever

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,390
basically they are it's really about

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,580
making the network programmable and

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,280
that's what software-defined network is

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,950
if the network is not programmable it's

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,540
really very hard you can have all the

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,490
speed that you want it's really very

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,830
hard to change things you know in a

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,260
millisecond type of interval to change

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,060
spectrum in a millisecond interval to

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,940
change the bandwidth that you would need

00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,340
in a millisecond type of interval so we

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,070
applying all of these we have actually

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,530
opened up several foundries in the

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,440
United States and one in Israel and one

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:22,030
in Mexico and we've we've we've opened

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,800
up sort of a 5g and an edge that uses

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,110
some of these open source software in

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,550
these families to allow us to prototype

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,830
with small businesses and large

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,560
businesses new concept in five years so

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,720
if you want to try something you want to

00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,700
test something you have an idea an open

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,710
source or some new software come and

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,060
work with us in our foundries whether

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,170
it's for the autonomous cars and we

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,390
working with a number of car

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,700
manufacturers where we are really

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:49,390
pushing that intelligence to the small

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,850
cell and to manage a number of cars sort

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,210
of moving at the same time all even we

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,360
you know redefining the retail of being

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:01,560
able to monitor manufacturing and really

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,530
change the conveyor belts of manufac

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,110
trying based on the point-of-sale at

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,780
that moment in time using 5g

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,880
technologies so let me finish here and

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,960
thanks very much for listening and look

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,549
forward to working with everyone here

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,549
