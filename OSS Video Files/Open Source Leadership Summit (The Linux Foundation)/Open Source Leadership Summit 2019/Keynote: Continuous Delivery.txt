	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,770
all right uh more so in addition to the

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,920
graph QL foundation we have another new

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,360
announcement today another new project

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,210
how many people here are familiar with

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,740
the concept of DevOps where's Chris

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,660
Chris he told me that was like new as of

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,060
this morning so continuous development

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,750
continuous integration you know this is

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,340
one of the cornerstones of modern the

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,530
modern development process the sort of

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,070
ability to rapidly create something

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,370
which I call micro services I coined

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,329
that term no but the ability to quickly

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,309
create code test it uh you know and

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,090
continuously deliver it is something

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,829
that's really important to modern

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,750
developer velocity I mean the the

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,020
continuous delivery concept is just

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,660
created huge huge returns in terms of

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,770
the speed at which developers can create

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,360
really really good code and to that and

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,250
the Linux Foundation is really excited

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,670
to announce our support for the

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,909
continuous delivery foundation this is a

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,619
collaboration to create a neutral home

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,119
for Jenkins anybody ever heard Jenkins

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:29,009
does anybody here used to everybody uses

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,840
Jenkins Jenkins X spinnaker and tacked

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,210
on these are going to be the cornerstone

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,450
projects of the continuous delivery

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,479
foundation these projects came from

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,340
various places we're very grateful to

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,649
folks like Netflix and Google who are

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,110
contributing code to this project this

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,110
will be a vendor-neutral home for the

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,020
open source projects for continuous

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,060
delivery and specifications related to

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,570
continuous delivery and the release

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,939
pipeline process we have amazing folks

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,100
joining us here today to announce it I

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,600
want to bring on to the stage

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,789
Kousaka Kawaguchi from cloud beast and

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,440
the creator of jenkins who is going to

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,450
talk to us about

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,020
the continuous delivery foundation

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,020
welcome

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,280
all right so um yeah I'm Coach K I'm

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,690
city of cabbies and I'm creative Jenkins

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,370
now but so many people have said before

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,980
every software deed in the world and

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,560
every business is under tremendous

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,890
pressure to transform itself into a

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,840
technology business now those of the

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,660
geeks in us and it sounds like you're my

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,849
kind of crowd so I didn't love that but

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,310
those of us who are in the technology

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,530
space we have discovered and encumbered

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,080
into a set of practices that we call the

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,690
continuous Tivoli it's the idea that the

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,650
getting the new software in the hands of

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,890
the users rapidly safely and quickly and

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,690
repeatedly is a key to give the business

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,660
the necessary agility that makes the

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,030
breaks the business and research has

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,610
shown the Stila case a time after time

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,010
some companies who'd even breathe this

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,769
culture they in the art being so

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,750
successful that also proves this case in

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,840
the real world you know companies like

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:32,170
Netflix and Google will try to invite on

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,420
stage now other companies also trying to

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,250
take note of that and they are trying to

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,470
apply this practice to the way they

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,720
develop the software but it turns out

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,190
that this is not as an easy practice as

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,500
it should be so it's not as widely

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,380
available so we think it's time to

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,329
democratize this practice and this VD is

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:54,489
a call a challenge to the industry so we

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:57,609
the continuous theory foundation we

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,850
answer that call we the founding members

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:03,730
of these foundations believe in the

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,290
mission and power of the city and as a

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,109
city of the Crabbie's and creative

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,790
jenkins the club is really believed in

00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,769
this mission for the longest time and

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,630
that kept me going so I'm really

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,579
thrilled that we now have a much bigger

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,560
group of people working together and

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:21,099
collectively we can make a lot bigger

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,110
impact another noteworthy things is the

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:26,800
presence of the end-user companies like

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,570
HSBC ethos and Capital One and then it's

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,610
another proof that these companies have

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,200
noticed that this practice makes a real

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,760
impact to the way they run the business

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,410
and so that's also like

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,310
part of the force behind this new

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,229
foundation now through the cdf we

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,389
advocate this practice of continuous

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,310
delivery in the industry and we

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,500
encourage practitioners to collaborate

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,070
across the barriers of companies to move

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,080
the state-of-the-art ford and obviously

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,479
we are a open source foundation so we

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,090
believe in the open source helping this

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,919
practice of CD and encompassing the wide

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,660
spectrum of the software delivery

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,540
lifecycle that's necessary to

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,780
successfully internet a CD and so we

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,539
seek to create a place to foster and

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,060
sustain thriving open-source projects

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:17,600
that collaborate and interoperate

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,949
between each other now

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,470
so that's what the container theory

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,340
foundations but but don't just take my

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,830
word for it

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,760
i'm here with my fellow leaders of this

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,570
mission together

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,180
so here I'd like to invite Kim she's a

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,419
product manager from Google Cloud please

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,419
welcome

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:47,250
thank you awesome hi everyone so I

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,230
joined our DevOps team about a year ago

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,900
at Google and I spent a ton of time

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,360
talking to customers hearing about their

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,160
CI CD practices of their organizations

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,620
and the challenges that they're up

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
against so it really brought me back to

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,250
my engineering days that startups when

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,040
we were trying to understand where all

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,840
this DevOps stuff meant anyway well the

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,030
one thing we could agree on is that we

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,370
knew if we caught problems in our code

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,740
early on in its lifecycle that we would

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,870
be saving ourselves a bunch of time

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:21,210
money and headaches from potential

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,400
production outages later on so deciding

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,220
to practice CIS CD was usually a easy

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,870
decision for companies to make but the

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,750
next step is figuring out which tools

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,060
and best practices to follow and so when

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,980
I started looking at the CI CD landscape

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,500
I got lost in the sheer number of tools

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,180
available and every time I would talk to

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,680
a customer they would tell me about some

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,130
new tool that I had never heard of

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,230
before so even at Google our engineers

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,570
have a ton of tools to choose from and

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,750
so while freedom of choice is great it

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:55,580
can eventually lead to frustration

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:58,260
fragmentation confusion and apathy

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,000
so in this leads to brittle software

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,600
delivery processes and portability

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,180
constraints and also security gaps and

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,570
as you can see from 12 CLC's tweet lots

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,000
and lots of bash scripting so while

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,130
homegrown solutions are never optimal oh

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,130
it's always the natural outcome of

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,800
solution sprawl and this is why adoption

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:24,780
and narrowing focus to supported

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,090
solutions is so important today but when

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,400
you squint at all these tools at their

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,040
core even though the terminology differs

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,580
greatly they all have a concept of a

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,210
workflow of pipeline artifacts source

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,580
code access build results and more but

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,130
the end goal is always the same get my

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:49,260
code from source to production as

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:51,240
quickly and securely as possible and so

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,669
at Google we took a step back

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,340
and after a few brainstorming sessions

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,460
some whiteboarding we asked ourselves if

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,789
we could do the same thing to CIA CD the

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,080
container kubernetes did with containers

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,090
that is could we collaborate with

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,449
industry leaders as a broader community

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,150
in the open to define a common set of

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,539
components and guidelines for CI CD

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,120
systems to build and deploy deploy code

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:26,699
anywhere whether that be mobile on cloud

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:27,000
vm's your sneakers anywhere next slide

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,699
please

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,010
and so this is how Tecton was born

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,860
Tecton is a shared set of building

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,180
blocks for building CI CD systems so

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,310
when we heard about the continuous

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,360
delivery foundation from cloudBees and

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,580
the linux foundation

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
we got super excited because it really

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,350
aligned with our vision of Tecton and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,060
our goal to help developers modernize on

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,589
their path to cloud and software

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,180
delivery best practices and now I would

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,279
like to introduce my engineering

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,180
teammate and lead on the Tecton project

00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,180
Christie Wilson

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:13,870
my shirt fix hi everybody

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,420
I'm Christie Wilson I'm a software

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,080
engineer at Google and I'm really

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,730
passionate about software quality

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,130
throughout my career I've always ended

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,280
up gravitating towards work that has to

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,010
do with C ICD and maybe one of the

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,270
reasons for that is that everybody needs

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:37,030
C ICD so before you can try to apply

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,670
fancy modern development practices like

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,780
Kaos engineering or progressive delivery

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,970
you have to start with C ICD if you want

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,370
your projects to scale if you want to

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,740
sustain growth if you want to grow your

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,310
open-source contributor base you have to

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,200
have C ICD and regardless of the size of

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,480
your company whether you have thousands

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,280
of engineers or you're a startup whether

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,740
you're working on Greenfield or you're

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,120
maintaining legacy software you have to

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,640
have C ICD and with the technological

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,500
shifts that we're seeing right now C ICD

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,130
has this really cool chance to take a

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:18,000
huge leap forward specifically if we can

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,380
Center our CI around containers

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,680
dynamically orchestrate those containers

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,720
and use serverless methodologies to

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,420
control our resource utilization and

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,900
then imagine if we can package all of

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,520
that in well-defined conformant api's so

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,420
that users can have all that power

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,330
without being locked in and that's what

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,270
Tecton pipelines is all about so Tecton

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,250
pipelines is a CIC D solution where

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,470
containers are the most basic building

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,480
block and then you can combine those

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,020
containers together to make complex

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,660
pipelines now we implemented this by

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,550
extending kubernetes but the API spec

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,890
itself could be implemented by any

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,070
vendor whether they're using kubernetes

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,470
or not and this is a collaborative

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,820
effort so right now we have regular

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,420
contributions from many companies

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,260
including Google cloud B's pivotal Red

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,620
Hat and IBM and as of today Tecton

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,350
pipelines is integrate

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,630
with K native with trigger mesh actions

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:25,190
and thanks to cloudBees support was

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,680
recently added to Jenkins X as well but

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,210
that's just the beginning with the CDF

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,330
we're looking forward to collaborating

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,630
with a community that's focused on CI CD

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:38,150
so that we can keep this going so that

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,210
an engineer can go to a project take the

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,490
entire CI CD pipeline and run it against

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,050
their own infrastructure or they can

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,400
take pieces and run them in isolation

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,800
and reuse them and the more vendors

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,740
support Tecton pipelines the more

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,930
choices users will have and eventually

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,520
they'll be able to take features from

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,370
multiple vendors and put them together

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:05,150
with one pipeline and so that's what

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,460
Tecton pipelines is all about and now

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:15,380
I'd like to introduce Tyler to talk

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:17,390
about Jenkins thanks how do you

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,000
everybody I'm Tyler I'm from the Jenkins

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,860
project and I'm I can't tell you how

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,050
excited I am to be here the continuous

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,210
delivery foundation was an idea that

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,540
started at a Jenkins contributor summit

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,640
almost two years ago and last year that

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,710
idea evolved at the open source

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,140
Leadership Summit in Sonoma I don't know

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,110
how many of you were able to join and

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,620
now it's become this really amazing

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,410
collaboration between all these

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,810
different companies so I hope you get a

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,160
lot of good work done here today there's

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,450
a lot of opportunities for us to do

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,120
something interesting and I look forward

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,880
to hearing about it at the 2020 open

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,010
source Leadership Summit so I don't

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,540
doubt that many people understand what

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,560
Jenkins is but just to give you a high

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,970
level overview Jenkins is an open source

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,440
automation server and the reason we

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,660
branded ourselves as the sort of

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,130
automation server is when Jenkins

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,260
started out it was really just about

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,000
continuous integration and then we

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,150
started to see that people in operations

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,500
were using Jenkins and as the industry

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,660
has moved forward we've found that

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,760
people are using Jenkins for continuous

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,620
integration for automated tasks all the

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,020
way up to continuous delivery pipelines

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,030
and to me that's a really strong

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,520
testament to the power of extensibility

00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,090
and open source that the Jenkins project

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,030
embodies

00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,030
and if you're curious what jenkins looks

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,130
like today and sort of what all of those

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:40,130
contributions have led to we've got this

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,100
really really rich ecosystem of plugins

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,410
and tools around jenkins to make it very

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,390
very usable and understandable to as

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,420
many people that are involved in the

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:53,870
software delivery process at a company

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,430
and with all of this innovation that

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,050
we've experienced over the past couple

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,620
years we've started to really see

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,480
pipelines and continuous delivery as the

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,090
new frontier of what we need to be

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,350
focusing on and so this opportunity to

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,930
work with a lot of other organizations

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,940
on pipelines and the concept of that

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,700
continuous delivery process is really

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,260
exciting but the Jenkins project and I

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,710
really want to hammer this home is not

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,350
just a technology thing the Jenkins

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,460
project for me I've been around for 10

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,580
plus years it's been quite a while

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,920
actually is a great group of people all

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,440
the way from committers like Chris and

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,140
and Andrew and Evelina that are trying

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,790
to push the Jenkins technology in

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,670
different ways whether it's on pipeline

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,950
or mobile or configuration as code all

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,770
the way to advocacy and marketing

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,840
contributions from people like Alissa or

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,300
Heidi that have helped make Jenkins user

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,460
conferences Jenkins area meetups and all

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,930
of the other great advocacy work that we

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,720
have going on in the Jenkins project a

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,640
reality and we're very lucky in that

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,680
it's not just been people it's been all

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,630
of these organizations from the Oregon

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,130
State University open source lab to

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,600
cloudBees which is funded such a

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,820
tremendous amount of development and

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,140
innovation to companies like Microsoft

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,550
which partnered with us for our

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,710
infrastructure which runs right now on

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,840
Azure to so many other organizations

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,640
that believe in Jenkins and believe in

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,920
the future of continuous integration and

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,260
continuous delivery and that's really

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,810
what has me excited about the continuous

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,660
delivery foundation is taking what we

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,730
already had going you know fairly well

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,290
in the Jenkins project we've we've

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,480
worked very hard to make it successful

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,340
and then bringing that up

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,290
yet another level with even more

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,260
collaboration and more investment from

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,970
all of these great companies across the

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,740
software development ecosystem to

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,690
improve not only Jenkins but the

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,550
continuous delivery space at large

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,410
and what Christy alluded to is one of

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,680
the things that I'm incredibly excited

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,780
about this idea of shared concepts for

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,310
what pipelines mean across these

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,320
different products and across these

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,120
different tools that people leverage to

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,520
implement continuous delivery processes

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,310
and so that's all I wanted to share with

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,700
you from Jenkins I'm very very happy to

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,040
introduce someone who has worked on one

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,930
of those products I look forward to

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,090
pipelines being integrated with Andy who

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:22,310
works on spinnaker from Netflix I'm

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:22,310
gonna panic thank you

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,030
Netflix set out to build spinnaker

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,210
because speed is a differentiator for

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,880
any business continuous delivery is the

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,390
means for businesses to thrive in

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:43,290
today's fast-paced world if a business

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,530
cannot rapidly reliably and safely

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:53,160
deliver value to its customers it will

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:55,500
be disrupted by one who can since

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,660
launching spinnaker in 2015 we've seen

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,170
growth span the grant span the gamut

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,410
from delivery metrics to community to

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:06,420
innovation in short order after we

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,510
release spinnaker internally we solve

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,220
deployments into AWS double from two

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,819
thousand a day to four thousand a day

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,420
but that metric didn't capture the true

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:22,140
value that spinnaker was providing to a

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:25,079
wide variety of end-users so today our

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,600
key metric at Netflix is running

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:31,050
pipelines which is at thirty thousand a

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,930
day in climbing we've seen the spinnaker

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:37,170
community grow from just one company

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:41,490
Netflix to hundreds of enterprises

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:45,660
around the globe and the innovations

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,790
that have blossomed both from internal

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,070
contributions at Netflix and external

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:54,110
contributions from the community have

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,110
pleasantly surprised many of us

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,950
it's because flexibility and plugg

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,990
ability of a delivery process has

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,120
unleashed unprecedented developer

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,840
productivity at Netflix and at other

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,350
enterprises not only do we at Netflix

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,900
use spinnaker to deliver containers and

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,060
VMs rapidly and safely to myriad

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,700
environments that span the globe but

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,160
spinnaker is also leveraged to deliver

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,970
firmware updates to our content delivery

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,070
network development teams across Netflix

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,150
use spinnaker to deliver libraries as

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,700
well and finally Spinnaker's pipelines

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:38,630
facilitate the safe rollout of runtime

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:41,450
properties and feature Flags spinnaker

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,670
powers the delivery of every aspect of

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:49,940
the Netflix product that hopefully many

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:52,520
of you enjoy tonight the chance to share

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,560
our many lessons learned and to learn

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,720
from a community laser focused on

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,570
continuous delivery is an opportunity we

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,940
couldn't pass up and we're thrilled at

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,380
the prospects of taking continuous

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,930
delivery to the next level

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:12,590
and to a wider audience of practitioners

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,300
and with that I am tremendously happy to

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,170
introduce Tracy who's going to talk

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:22,839
about Jenkins ex

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,839
[Applause]

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:49,869
okay can you hear me now yeah brilliant

00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:52,029
okay so Jenkins X it's the CI CD

00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:57,399
solution for modern cloud applications

00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:58,330
on kubernetes and software delivery is a

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,519
team sport

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,460
there's just like a ton of research that

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:07,929
says high-performing teams automate

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,629
their CI CD and use the cloud well so

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:14,080
using the cloud well means today using

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:16,419
kubernetes as the you know the default

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,539
operating system of the cloud that runs

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:22,690
on premise you know public cloud private

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,830
cloud or hybrid and Jenkins X supports

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:31,269
all these different flavors of

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:34,690
kubernetes so whether you are writing

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:38,409
new cloud native applications or maybe

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,509
you're migrating existing applications

00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:43,419
and you want it to run you know in a

00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:46,719
containerized orchestrated cloud native

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:50,190
environment then Jenkins X can help you

00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,960
by providing pipeline automation

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,239
built-in get ops and preview

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,129
environments actually preview

00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:59,830
environments are the one feature that

00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:02,139
get developers really excited this sort

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:05,849
of eyes really light up that's because

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:08,109
every time you do a pull request then a

00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:10,509
dynamic preview environment is created

00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:14,739
so you get to review your feature before

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:17,320
it's merged so this like makes all the

00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:18,879
difference to shipping code faster

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,979
without having to worry about breaking

00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:26,589
things and one of the reasons that

00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:28,809
Jenkins X can provide such features like

00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:31,479
the project has only been around for you

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,429
know just barely a year is that it

00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,210
really it builds on sort of this

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,690
best-of-breed

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,450
open source project so projects like

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,429
kubernetes Jenkins helm prowl and most

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:47,710
recently Tecton as we saw from Christie

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:50,169
and we see close community collaboration

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,019
as the key to our success so we're

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:55,089
really looking forward to with the cdf

00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,280
working with other open source

00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:59,530
communities particularly

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,880
the cloud native compute foundation so

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:07,270
CN CF which is the home of kubernetes so

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,640
much so that our very first event will

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:12,870
be the continuous delivery summit which

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,480
will be co-located with cube corn

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,460
Barcelona so we'll be there with was it

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,620
twelve thousand other people that's nah

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,630
but come find us

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,410
but yeah the whole thing with DevOps

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:29,460
it's not just about tools so there's

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:32,950
this whole aspect of best practices and

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,930
team culture and attitude you know all

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,580
the really easy things

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,910
so we already care about having the

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,590
space where we can bring people together

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,510
focus on these aspects and grow together

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,060
and you know we're looking forward to

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,430
doing some exciting things like having

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,490
some focus on CD for specific areas like

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:57,370
finance and embedded so we really hope

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:59,230
you can join us for that event and of

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,270
course that event you'll hear all about

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,940
our four founding projects so Tecton

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,400
jenkins spinnaker and jenkins x and also

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,510
about our vision to get these projects

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,700
integrated and really working together

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:19,810
in a way that provides you know cohesive

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,880
CI CD that has AI users in mind it's not

00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,490
going to be easy but I do promise it

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,730
