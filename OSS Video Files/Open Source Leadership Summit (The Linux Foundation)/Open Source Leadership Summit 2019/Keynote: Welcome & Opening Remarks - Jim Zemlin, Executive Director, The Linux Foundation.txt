	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,740
good morning a lot we got a packed house

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:10,740
here although I know we had about 500

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,269
people who registered for this and I was

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,040
looking out on the lawn last night and

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,080
so a lot of people out there very late

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,330
so I suspect they'll be coming in in a

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,609
few minutes a couple of housekeeping

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,920
announcements first of all the heat

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,630
we've asked them to turn up the heat

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,820
outside because I know it's a little bit

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,859
chilly we'll make that happen for you

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,720
we've also ordered a terrific sunset

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,320
tonight right over the ocean for

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,180
everyone

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,760
it's gonna be beautiful if you caught

with our L of energy project it's gonna

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,949
be amazing just out on the lawn I looked

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,840

00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,730
again so the evening reception is going

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,500
to be just out on the lawn right over

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,790

from 5:45 on please come and join us

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,820
there are also going to be lots of

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,000
evening networking opportunities so from

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,610
5:30 to 7 we have the Oceanside happy

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,410
hour and then every night from 8:30 to

00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,120
10:00 we're gonna have night caps and

00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,730
networking on the fire pits in the ocean

00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,830
lawn and all over the place so please

00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:05,590
take advantage of that everyone is on

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,260
their own for dinner but there is a

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,750
shuttle service to the downtown area

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:14,440
from the hotel so if you want to take

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,050
advantage of that please do and then

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,000
also please use our networking

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,700
applications so we have the briella

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,900
networking application there is the link

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,010
and the code right there

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,900
please take advantage of it we also have

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,360
a few news announcements that we already

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,970
announced this week the chips Alliance

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,570
start we announced yesterday this is a

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,120
new initiative around open chip design a

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,760
new security initiative called the Red

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,250
Team project which is helping improve

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,410
the security of Linux distributions in

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,150
particular and then we're proud of one

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,530
thing the cloud native computing

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,510
foundation has reached their 375 member

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,610
mark I don't know if the executive

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,610
director of CNCs later took their stand

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,650
if you see Dan he will incessantly tell

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,540
you how they're the fastest growing open

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,989
source organization ever it's actually

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,989
incredibly annoying but congratulations

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:18,340
to the cloud native computing foundation

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:21,459
so just an amazing amount of news all

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,220
the way around and you know it kind of

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,950
culminates from a 2018 where the Linux

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,230
Foundation itself grew faster than we

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,239
ever had it was an amazing year we

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,769
launched more projects than we have in

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,350
the history of the organization more

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,500
people join the organization than ever

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,630
it's just amazing and I think it it

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,980
encapsulates sort of what I want to talk

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,080
briefly about this morning

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,750
or I introduce the rest of our amazing

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,879
speakers for the day which is that we

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,430
are really entering this amazing golden

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,590
age of open source now having said that

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,239
I am certain that I have called it the

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,140
golden age of open source for at least

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:04,120
15 years but this time it really is the

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:07,239
cult image of open source there we go

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,190
it's always said but the the thing that

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,790
I thought is interesting about this is

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,110
you know it's 2019 and it's it's

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,790
something that we shouldn't all take for

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,410
granted in terms of the fact that open

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,470
source is just so wildly successful

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,350
today and I started thinking about like

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,419
how could I communicate how tough it was

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,760
in the early days for a lot of the

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,340
vanguards of open source particularly in

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,620
terms of people for where open source

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,900
intersected with the business world like

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,880
how difficult it was in the early days

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,160
like we have so much to be grateful for

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,979
in terms of standing on the shoulders of

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,750
giants the the Richard Stallman's the

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,510
leanest core Vols the the people from

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,789
the Apache Software Foundation from OSI

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,560
who you know define the meaning and

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,660
definition of open source these are real

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,840
giants but I kept thinking like how can

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,289
I like go back and kind of get a really

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,020
concrete way about how challenging it

00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,240
has been and how far we have come and so

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,650
what I did was I went back and looked at

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,570
the Red Hat s-1 this is the dot the

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,520
documents you file when you go public

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:17,770
and this was in 1999 so in 1999 Red Hat

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,770
went public on NASDAQ it was a big deal

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,970
and you have to when you go public I was

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,979
part of a company that went public a

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,440
long time ago you have to you know file

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,539
all these SCC documents including your

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,150
s-1 statement which includes not only

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:34,570
upside for the investment opportunity

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,370
but then the downside risks and these

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,680
are literally verbatim the risk

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,770
statements from the Red Hat 1999 s1 and

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,970
I think it's just so it's such a great

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,560
encapsulation of what people were super

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,550
worried about it at the time

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,010
you're worried enough to have to

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,289
disclose it in this regulatory document

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,150
the fact that you know the business

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,620
model of open source still wasn't quite

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,570
proven

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,330
that the open-source community itself

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,240
would react negatively to the concept of

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,690
monetization or business as it relates

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,970
to open source the Red Hat folks were

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,180
worried that they rely on the support of

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,860
limas Torvalds and other prominent Linux

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,340
developers which I might add they

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,750
continue to be worried about to this day

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,960
that suppose my laugh line he didn't

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,090
even get it alright so but again

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,330
interesting that the competition from

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,460
Microsoft the fact that all of this

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,050
independent code is hard to bring

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,310
together its maintained by all these

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,539
disparate people around the world and

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,419
then we were really worried about

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:40,570
intellectual property rights these were

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,520
heady times back then 1999 to early

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,919
2000s you know you had sort of this

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,770
ascendancy of people figuring out the

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,169
concept of open source Microsoft was

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,729
running ads in Europe sort of keying in

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,849
on these weaknesses that were described

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:57,789
in the s1 around fragmentation and the

00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,470
disparate development effort schoo the

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,810
corporate enemy number one there does

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,060
anyone remember schoo the UNIX company

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,330
right that was essentially bringing

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,190
litigation against all of these folks

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,889
claiming that they they were the true

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,990
owners of the Linux copyright and we

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,780
were facing the Internet bubble and so

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,150
on and so forth huge challenges big

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,120
things that needed to be overcome and

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,419
the most amazing part about it now in

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,449
retrospect 20 years later it's just how

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:32,470
those obstacles were systematically

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:34,900
overcome how far we've come in terms of

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,570
overcoming all of those risks and

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,550
turning them into real opportunity and I

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,550
think if you look back history judges it

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,789
as this amazing amazing success I mean

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:51,490
certainly in the case of Linux we have

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:56,729
come a long way could advance that slide

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:59,710
there you're just ruining my pacing here

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,430
there we go a really long way until we

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,979
get to the next line

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,870
so Linux has really come a long way I

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,550
mean it really has eventually come to

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,590
dominate almost every market

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,479
that it has entered like it's just

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:15,490
amazing to think about back in 1999 Red

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,310
Hat is worried about whether or not the

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,110
Linux platform as a business concept as

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,699
a platform itself in the wake of this

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,009
competition was was even going to

00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,990
succeed and it has probably succeeded at

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,440
least in my case beyond our wildest

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,159
dreams the Linux Foundation itself has

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,459
also become very successful in and a

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,250
critical part of the tech ecosystem

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:41,589
today we have over 1300 members many of

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,130
you are here today this is our member

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:47,440
event 100% of the Fortune 100 tech and

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,420
telecom we have thousands and thousands

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,190
of developers working just on Linux

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,600
Foundation projects which are a small

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,550
percentage of me I would argue an

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,020
important set of projects but a small

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,550
percentage of the overall open source

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,410
projects that are out there just

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,240
creating an amazing value in 2018 a new

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,130
company a new organization joined the

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,079
Linux Foundation every single day that

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,970
same pattern continues into 2019 I think

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,890
what's really interesting though is if

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,660
you look back in particular over the

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,720
last couple of years you just have these

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,370
great concrete ways that all these

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,220
challenges that we were all worried

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,070
about 20 years ago in open source have

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,320
been overcome for example the concern

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,610
about competition with Microsoft I mean

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,110
certainly that has completely 180 many

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,240
Microsoft is there people from Microsoft

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,390
here in the room is David I say there we

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,370
go I see a bunch of you Microsoft has

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,490
turned from you know a competitor of

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,060
Linux to one of the biggest contributors

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:52,240
to Linux open source in general in the

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,490
world it is really impressive to see the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,350
work that's going on at Microsoft and

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,980
Microsoft is putting their money where

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,329
their mouth is and this is a hat tip -

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,660
at David Rudin and some of the legal

00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:06,310
team over there at Microsoft where not

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,810
only are they big contributors to the

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,279
open-source community and participating

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:15,520
in all these projects but they've also

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,260
come to help us solve another problem

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,240
that we were all worried about back in

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,250
99 which was intellectual property

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,860
concerns around open

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,890
source as a signatory to the open invent

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,900
networks license I think Keith Berg out

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,630
the CEO of open invention network is

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,470
there in the back we've essentially had

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,060
peace breakout in IP world of open

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,320
source you know it's a meaningful

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,960
agreement where Microsoft has agreed to

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,880
not state claims on on Linux and related

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,620
technology and it's not just

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,690
intellectual property or the fact that

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:54,780
Microsoft we now love you it's also just

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,390
the business model itself in 2018 I

00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,970
think really culminated how much the

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,240
business model of open source has proven

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,830
to be successful we like at the Linux

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,300
Foundation to call this the Torvalds

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,390
effect of course because obviously this

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,190
works at the Linux Foundation but last

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,780
year a number one at number four of the

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,760
largest tech acquisitions were both

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,460
directly based on technology that

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,380
leanness had started the Red Hat

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,660
acquisition thirty four billion dollars

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,580
one of the largest software acquisitions

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,080
in history actually the largest software

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,280
acquisition history and then obviously

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,550
github 7.5 billion dollars just

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:36,200
demonstrating the amazing value in clear

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,150
huge numbers that show just how valuable

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,830
open source is Red Hat in particular the

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,470
Red Hat folks in the room here a few of

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,140
you see around there we go Chris

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,690
what an amazing for a company that in

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,620
1999 was worried about your business

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,530
model 69 straight quarters of growth

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,640
like lytic hole-in-one I mean just this

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,290
amazing journey for an organization like

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,020
I mean if that's not a good business

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:07,740
model I don't know what is but it's not

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:11,280
just the two mergers and acquisitions we

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,660
saw last year but just lots and lots of

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:19,080
amazing outcomes in open source from a

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,270
business perspective you know I look at

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,210
just the amount of value that's

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,130
demonstrated here that is sort of you

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,380
can measure right based on you know

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,959
private equity investment in IPO some

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,450
kind of M&A that doesn't even include

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,300
all the value that's being captured

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,740
by organizations like Toyota who are

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,660
using open-source to build their

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,920
automotive cockpit experience or

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,450
companies like Google Amazon Microsoft

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,980
Alibaba Tencent Huawei and others who

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,330
are using open source to power their

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,980
cloud right but none of that is even

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,480
none of that values even captured in

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,330
here so we're not talking I mean it's

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,480
far more than 70 billion dollars you

00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,590
know outside of the IPO and M&A activity

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:07,620
that we see here what's also interesting

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:11,340
is the as we talk about M&A today we are

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:14,580
launching an ebook an open-source ebook

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,100
that you can all get on M&A practices so

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,770
for all of you who are involved in open

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,720
source and are looking at acquiring more

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:26,250
open source companies there was so much

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:30,240
M&A activity we decided to write a book

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,770
about it there's a we that's why the

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,370
slides didn't work before we miss my

00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:37,190
punchline all right anyways the thing

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,590
that I want to talk about today is that

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,080
at the foundation one of the things that

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,590
we talk about all the time is how do you

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,980
build healthy robust sustainable open

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,510
source ecosystems and this generally

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,620
works sometimes it doesn't

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,260
we're gonna talk about that this

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,700
afternoon but generally what we want to

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,800
do here and what we're working with all

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,110
of you to achieve is to be the best

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,200
possible upstream for a commercial

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,620
downstream so that open source projects

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,900
can be multi stakeholder driven they

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,350
start with great code but they don't end

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,440
there the code then is created by a

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,420
robust diverse group of stakeholders who

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,670
then use that to create commercial

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,180
products and services that capture the

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:28,200
kind of value I just demonstrated that

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,180
then take that technology create these

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,980
products services to get profit for

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,450
their organization or capture value in

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,240
some other way as a government

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,580
organization that's reducing cost or a

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,140
nonprofit that's trying to achieve

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,500
things for the greater good

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,900
and then people take that value take

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,130
those profits reinvest them back into

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,440
the open source project

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,180
largely in the form of those thousands

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,730
and thousands of developers who work on

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,920
the project that create better code more

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,500
value that begets better products and

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,140
services for all of us more profit more

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,070
value more reinvestment better products

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,720
it's that cycle that we're trying to

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,850
promote and that's what really creates

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
this economic sustainability of

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,410
open-source it's one time we're in

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,750
seeking profit we can all collectively

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:19,110
benefit at the same time we're helping

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,310
yourself is helping others at the same

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,800
time and I think that's something that

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,750
really has proven out historically to be

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,050
the most effective part of open-source

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,970
uh and doing this requires a lot of work

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:34,260
this is one thing that the foundation is

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:36,990
super proud of the fact that in over

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,720
many years we figured out a process to

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,090
help these big projects create big

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,490
sustainable ecosystems whether it's

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,920
hosting events like this or many of the

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,990
hundreds of developer events we host all

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,230
over the world that caught you know

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,270
thousands of developers attend our next

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,360
a big event is going to be the coop con

00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,480
cloud native con in Barcelona we are

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,770
expecting twelve thousand attendees at

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,420
that single event just amazing we've got

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,820
to give a shout out to Angela Brownback

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,150
there and her team at the amazing work

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,150
they do

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,340
they're the ones who got the dirt-cheap

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,080
room rate here at this hotel for those

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,970
of you who got in on our room rate good

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,920
for you for those who didn't you got a

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,130
register early next time you really

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,470
really do we have a legal team Mike

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,660
Dolan Scott Nicholas Steve Winslow and

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,940
Karen koppenhaver who are some of the

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,160
foremost IP mines in the world they're

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,290
the ones yes that call you up and make

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,970
sure you've signed your agreements that

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,590
the trademark has been properly

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,350
registered that the intellectual

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:46,250
property the provenance of the code the

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,930
way that we run these organizations is

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,910
clear so that you can share what you

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,130
want to share keep what you want to keep

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,680
that is one of the golden tenants of

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,130
open source allowing people to share in

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,830
a way that is trustworthy and allows

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,600
them to build this code very fast we've

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,550
trained millions of students at the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,420
Linux Foundation to help these projects

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,620
create value more quickly certification

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,660
is something that we've really focused

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,550
on particularly in the last few years

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,439
this is solving one of those concerns

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,560
that Red Hat had in their s-1 again

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,620
about interoperability cobbling these

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,060
components together making sure that for

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,560
example in kubernetes in their

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,360
kubernetes service provider

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,310
certification platform you can be

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,470
assured that whether you're running on

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,020
one cloud or another you're using the

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,660
same consistency across those four

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,520
kubernetes and many many more we have a

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,000
whole DevOps team that helps these

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,010
projects through the infrastructure that

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,560
they host release management and more

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,710
and then finally this year in 2019 and

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,330
you're gonna hear more about that today

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,310
we are really focused on application

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,410
security in particular for these big

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:59,040
projects that the world and industry is

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,230
depending upon again we're gonna talk

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,160
more about that today but I thought it

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:08,580
would be fun to see how Linux foundation

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,340
projects are being used in the industry

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,890
and this is my favorite thing to show

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:18,390
all of you today how many people will

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:21,360
watch the Oscars the other day anyone so

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,950
I'll the chairman of one of our projects

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:30,040
like three people

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:31,720
what the hell just this morning is going

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,020
terribly

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,520
so one of the chair the chairman of one

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,300
of our projects was actually nominated

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,960
for an Academy nominated for an Academy

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,840
Award this year for visual effects they

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,680
didn't win it dang it

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,430
but I we started an organization called

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,920
the Academy Software Foundation Rob Rita

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,300
who is the the gentleman from Industrial

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,900
Light and Magic who was nominated for a

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,850
visual effects Oscar it was such a great

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,850
advocate for the concept of using open

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,010
source in the film industry you know if

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,460
you look at companies like Lucas Disney

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,160
Pixar others they're storytellers but

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,830
they tell their story through digital

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,350
effects through computer graphics and

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,390
animation there's this great story that

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,520
they tell where the hundred and sixty

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,220
eighth most profitable films ever made

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,100
like one through 168 are all CGI and

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,400
animation / Riven 169 I think it's the

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,110
right event something 160 something the

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,960
only live-action movie that gets up that

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,790
high is Mamma Mia which I actually

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,470
really liked it's just it's a wonderful

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:46,060
film but I want to show you just when

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,130
you're trying to explain to someone what

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,410
open source is and what it's used for

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,670
and why that collaboration works

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,290
sometimes it's a little tricky to

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,780
explain somebody's not super familiar

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,330
with technology the following video I

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,380
think does an amazing job of doing that

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,540
so let me show you the video here oops

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,120
creative filmmakers today rely more than

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,820
ever on engineers and scientists using

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,420
open source software to help craft

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,920
fantastic visionary images every single

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,570
part of the filmmaking process is

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,120
touched by software and a lot about

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,190
software is open source software some of

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,650
the greatest innovations we've seen in

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,570
the modern era of filmmaking have

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,850
actually been supported by open source

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,280
software the Academy of Motion Picture

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,020
Arts and Sciences and the Linux

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,360
Foundation

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,240
have created the academy software

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,090
foundation with support from industry

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,280
leaders the Academy Software Foundation

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,440
exists to provide a great home for open

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,050
source projects that we as an industry

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,820
use every day to projects the Academy

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:52,530
Software Foundation is currently working

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:55,920
on our open VDB and open color i/o open

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:58,530
VDB is a volumetric data block format it

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,900
is pretty ubiquitous in use anytime we

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,240
have an explosion its BTB anytime you

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,550
have clouds it's EDB anywhere you have a

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,890
lot of fluid simulation fireballs gas

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,610
flowing across surface things that are

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,960
big we think there's value in having an

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,940
organization outside of DreamWorks take

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,890
responsibility for this and I think

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,960
we've already seen a benefit in that

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,700
that we've had other Studios step

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,760
forward in a way they had not previously

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,620
with contributions to the standard open

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,809
Clara is an open source color management

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,720
solution for motion picture production

00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,880
and and everyone working on a show from

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,679
an artist at a workstation to a director

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,900
in a theater can see the same image and

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,790
speak the same visual language open

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,290
claro is compatible with ESA's and can

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,780
be used to implement any well-defined

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,460
color standard highly critical projects

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,900
need oversight particularly for more

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,940
than one studio or company and can

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,980
benefit greatly from not only shared

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,990
development resources but also the solid

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,250
infrastructure offered by the Linux

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,380
Foundation and their involvement in the

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,059
academy Software Foundation or whether

00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,610
you are a user of open source software

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,170
or an engineer or company that relies on

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,150
open source software we want to create

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,230
the right ecosystem for you to get the

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,620
most out of the open source software

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:10,710
that you need to use find us that a SWF

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,890
dot IO and join the mailing list and see

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,720
how you can get involved pretty

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,820
impressive right so a couple quick notes

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,559
on that the narrator the woman you hear

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,830
at the beginning that's literally the

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,590
voice of the Oscars which is so amazing

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,480
I mean for our open source projects a to

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,400
describe an open source and project as

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,390
like anytime anytime anything explodes

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,300
in a movie that's open VDB is is awesome

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,429
to have a nose and you know spider-man

00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,809
in a promotional video for an

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:43,590
open-source project I don't think it's

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:44,490
ever been done I mean think about it

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,220
the

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:50,730
you know Linux all they have is talks

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,800
right I mean I'm talking Panos here

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,760
right like destroying half of the

00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:01,470
universe right to their credit CN CF

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:04,650
they have phibian friends not quite the

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,540
same and then but that's probably

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,530
something one of our networking projects

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,360
are a good example they have these

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:14,840
really difficult to understand

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,840
architectural diagrams like nobody gets

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,650
but here's one thing that that is

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,270
interesting is our networking projects

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,920
and I think this is easy understand the

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,350
open network automation platform is

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,480
being used to do something that I think

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,550
is easier to understand check out this

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,740
video of how open source software is

00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,300
being used to orchestrate a network

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,960
that's saving people's lives let's let's

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,960
roll this video

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,610
firstnet is one of those opportunities

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:46,429
to make a fundamental difference in

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,000
every public safety responders approach

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:52,220
to managing emergencies

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,670
you've got agencies converging on to one

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,570
central geographic location

00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,420
communication and getting resources

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,550
where they need to be is a challenge by

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,080
no fault whatsoever of the individuals

00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,640
that are there responding to the scene

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,980
it's the technology that they had

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,160
available to them they're trying to

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,990
coordinate a disastrous mass chaos this

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,970
is when the network gets bogged down and

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,250
they can't communicate with one another

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,460
because the system was not set up to do

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,460
so

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,040
the technology that they've used at this

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,470
point really pales in comparison to what

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,480
we're going to provide them on firstnet

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,520
[Music]

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,470
this individual is missing this is their

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,250
potential location and then we can call

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:43,090
for a helicopter to have live infrared

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:45,700
searching for an individual figure guys

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,040
now communications between agencies and

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,290
among agencies I'm always talking always

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:56,650
up on the network always using the data

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:58,809
live in real-time so we can search

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,450
quicker we can find people quicker and

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,410
then as soon as we find a victim we can

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,890
get them extricated

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:12,130
triage treated transport it to the

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:14,170
hospital we're putting teams in their

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,970
hands that they can see what's happening

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,420
around them and react to it in a way

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,950
that saves lives I'm really proud to be

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,330
part of something that's going to

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,620
revolutionize Public Safety we're gonna

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:38,190
take really good care of them

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:41,340
[Music]

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,800
pretty amazing I want to thank AT&T

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,390
powered by open source open network yet

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,490
there's the architecture it's it's

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,420
somewhere in there but you know really

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,060
really impressive

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,530
that open source is being used to do all

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,150
these amazing things you would have

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:01,020
never thought twenty years ago

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,610
I'm also happy to report that one of our

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,540
other projects the Yocto project is

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,040
being used in space so this is from

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,230
Yocto it's an embedded Linux

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,900
distribution it's a build tool for that

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,580
and this is being used on a satellite

00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,730
that currently is in the vicinity of

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:21,240
Mars I think this goes on the record for

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,700
the farthest distance a Linux system has

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,910
ever traveled into space so we want to

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,700
call that out in 2019 our hyper ledger

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,550
project is being used in supply chain

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,120
management to help people and to reduce

00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:37,470
exploitation tantalum is something that

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,020
you've got in your pockets right now

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,930
it's a rare earth element that's used to

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,540
create transistors in smartphones and

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:49,230
laptop our hyper ledger fabric project

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:51,300
is being used to manage the supply chain

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,730
of this rare earth element to make sure

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,160
that we know where it came from and that

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,610
it doesn't come from places where you

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,500
have child exploitation slave labor and

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,330
others so we're not only you know

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,520
helping making the world a safer place

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,500
and disaster recovery situations but

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,020
helping supply chains be honest and

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,730
transparent even more than that here's

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,610
another project that the foundation that

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,710
I'm super happy to be associated with is

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,900
Josh in the audience somewhere here Josh

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,620
from let's encrypt I saw him so there he

00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:25,590
is when Josh and I first met we were

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,750
talking about how he wanted to create

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,630
this free certificate authority that was

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:33,030
super easy for people to use to encrypt

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,400
Internet and web traffic just apt-get

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,710
let's encrypt install it it's free it's

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,310
awesome at the time I think the amount

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:44,370
of HTTP paid flows in the US was like 40

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:47,610
percent something like that and now it's

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,500
up to 87 percent right and you know

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,110
let's encrypt is now the world's largest

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,840
certificate authority in

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,500
had a meaningful impact on all of our

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,510
collective security and privacy drone

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,580
code another Linux Foundation project

00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:06,860
has clocked more flight hours than any

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:10,429
aerospace company this year they are

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,650
down in Tijuana flight testing every day

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,080
putting in code revisions figuring out

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,720
how to do this it is an impressive

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,270
operation they're working with

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,790
regulators to use that code and those

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,799
clock all those flight hours to draw

00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,360
conclusions about the future of drone

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,460
technology in the United States and

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,610
speaking of drones it doesn't stop there

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,650
another Linux Foundation project

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,590
automotive-grade Linux is being used

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:40,340
before the onboard operating system for

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,830
the Daimler for the Mercedes drones and

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,330
vans vans and drones delivery vehicles

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,760
right so these are vehicles that go

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,580
around and a drone comes out through the

00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,250
roof of the car and delivers packages

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:54,740
drones don't stop there our Zephyr from

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,230
real-time operating system project also

00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:01,929
participated in the Super Bowl halftime

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:04,790
show this this year with the drones

00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:06,890
Pepsi sugar halftime show if you saw

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,630
that so all of this stuff powered by

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,870
open-source is amazing to see how far

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,900
we've come but for as far as we have

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,960
come I think we still have a long way to

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,210
go and that's what I want to talk about

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,740
this afternoon after we listen to our

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,500
speakers this morning who have amazing

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,630
news about new projects at the LF lots

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,580
of exciting things they're doing for

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,630
everything we were worried about back in

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,850
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,100
the amazing accomplishments over 20

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,290
years for open source we still have a

00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,750
long way to go I think it's important

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,600
now here at this event with leaders in

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,940
open source and the industry to confront

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,950
some of the tough problems around open

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,130
source the first one I think we can all

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,049
agree on is application security

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,510
application security continues to be an

00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:56,390
issue for all forms of software and

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:59,169
open-source is obviously a critical part

00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:02,270
of the software ecosystem we see

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:04,240
vulnerabilities that are exploited on a

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,300
regular basis whether it's

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,870
Equifax or heartbleed or things like

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,940
that we're vulnerable code bugs and

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,610
software are exploited to expose the

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,430
private data or worse of people all over

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,980
the world and if you look you know snick

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,710
did a recent survey where open-source

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,620
maintainer czar telling us we need help

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,270
that they're getting better at

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,080
application security but it's just not

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,180
enough

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,870
one in four open-source maintainer x'

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,340
does not audit their codebase even worse

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,900
and i think this is one of the toughest

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,940
thing it's just the number of

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,220
vulnerabilities found in open source as

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,160
open source increases in popularity and

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,920
in the sheer amount continues to

00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,190
increase at a very very fast pace

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,850
we need to collectively do something

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:57,940
about application security and it's not

00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,960
just application security there are

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,410
important open source projects that lack

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:09,700
resources funding and resources to help

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,680
make those projects better you know if

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,230
you talk to open source developers they

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,090
get frustrated that they're doing kind

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,440
of all this work that you know that

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,610
people think oh you know hardware

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,750
something you have to pay for but like

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,330
you know I can just create all this

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,250
stuff for free gentlemen right here in

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,960
the front row mark you can relate to

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,610
this statement you know who can do all

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,670
this stuff you know maintain this for

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,530
free you know often in it in a github

00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,360
repo you have people who just fly by and

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,650
expect commercial support from somebody

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,110
who's maintaining a code base

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,700
essentially for free there are these

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,100
awesome Twitter feeds that I see all the

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,830
time about like stuff maintainer x' here

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,210
you know hey can you just I I have to do

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,040
this for a product naming can you just

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,590
apply this patch or release a little bit

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,950
earlier for me and and just are not

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:55,210
phoning up anything for that the final

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,950
thing that I think is a meaningful

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,710
problem that we need to be introspective

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:03,100
about and help is the shortage of

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:07,990
diversity in our communities it's just

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,550
an obvious fact I think that in 2017 the

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,150
one of the most recent survey is about

00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:15,790
gender in a large group of open-source

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,070
communities just these numbers are not

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,230
good right I think we all

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,300
are aware of the issue I think everybody

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,520
agrees that diverse communities are

00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,260
strong communities I mean there's just

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,570
academic study after academic study

00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,300
about how diversity creates better

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,830
outcomes this is something that is a

00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,250
challenge that we all need to

00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:38,650
collectively work on so for as far as we

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,750
have come the challenge that I want to

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,030
have everybody think about the entire

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,640
week you're here how can we create a

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,040
better application security how can we

00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,720
get more resources into the developers

00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,600
hands that we the developers who we

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,780
depend on and how can we create more

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,660
diversity in these communities and as a

00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:01,900
part of that thus afternoon the Linux

00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,220
Foundation has some new ideas I'm not

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,860
just gonna get up here and complain

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,800
about things we've been working for

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,650
quite some time on some solutions that

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,770
we can think that we think can help

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,660
improve all of these things and this

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:20,620
afternoon we're gonna introduce you to

00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:26,410
something new that we think will solve

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:29,410
all of these challenges so you know any

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:31,990
organization like ours or any of all of

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,990
yours every once in a while needs to

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,450
think of new ways to approach and solve

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,570
problems and I wanted to show one last

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,550
clip from a Super Bowl a series of

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,590
advertisements that IBM launched way

00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,750
back when when we were worried about all

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,270
these things I think it's time for us to

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:54,750
take the advice of the gentleman in this

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,750
video about how we can change once again

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,639
[Applause]

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,639
[Music]

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:21,189
she pays up shake of the world

00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,189
[Music]

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:31,960
that was from maybe 1617 years ago IBM

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:34,570
ran these iconic set of ads that showed

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,250
this little child who was sharing

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,320
knowledge with folks like Muhammad Ali

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,169
and others that was going to change the

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,490
world I think it's time for us to shake

00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:44,860
things up again and we've got some

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,179
interesting stuff this afternoon so with

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,399
that I want to thank you for listening

00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:53,610
to me for an extended period of time and

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,610
