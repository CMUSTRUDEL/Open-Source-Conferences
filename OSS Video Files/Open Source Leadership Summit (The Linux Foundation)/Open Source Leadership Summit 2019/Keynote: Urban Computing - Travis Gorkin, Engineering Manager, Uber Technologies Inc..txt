thanks for that introduction I'm very

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,420
excited to be here from ubers data

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,260
visualization in urban computing team

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,750
talk about how we are using urban

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,719
computing and how we're really embracing

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,330
open source to do that let me start

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,730
really briefly by giving an overview of

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,250
what at a high level

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,430
urban computing is so from an urban

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,369
aspect urban computing is about tackling

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,440
challenges that cities have across a

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,399
broad area of safety road infrastructure

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,579
equitable access to transportation

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,250
energy consumption traffic congestion

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,700
tons of applications of how we see urban

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,219
computing can be used in terms of how we

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,539
approach that urban computing really

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,600
starts from data across a wide variety

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,079
of heterogeneous sources so that can be

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,510
data from sensors it could be data

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,059
that's collected from incidents or

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,950
government agencies we combine that data

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:12,090
together we use data science to analyze

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,689
it aggregate it process it we use data

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,750
visualization techniques to provide

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,580
insights into that data again so that we

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,619
can tackle challenges that cities may

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,930
have across a variety of different areas

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,200
so that's at a high level what urban

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,280
computing is to help that sink in I want

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,549
to just walk through a really brief

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,500
example of how we're thinking about

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,420
urban computing in the context of

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,470
transportation so for context this graph

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,540
right here shows over the last decade

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,759
traffic fatalities we can see that it

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,549
was declining since 2007 and then in

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,920
2015 and 16 there was an increase in

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,310
traffic fatalities about five percent

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,280
year-over-year and transportation

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,439
decision-makers policymakers they had

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,850
some information about this but they

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,630
didn't have a lot of detailed granular

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,580
insight into what was leading to this

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,520
even more specifically there was an

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,610
incident on

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,970
December 27th 2017 traffic fatality

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,550
killed a 17 year old passenger at in New

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,890
York City at the the corner of canal and

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,330
Bowery streets this is a tragic incident

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,480
and I bring this up because in from this

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,130
specific example here we can start to

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,380
using urban computing glean some

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,330
important insights and use those

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,040
insights more broadly to understand

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,140
potentially what's leading to these

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,480
traffic increase in traffic fatalities

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,450
so the US Department of Transportation

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,630
knows that of the 40,000 traffic

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,670
fatalities a year over 10,000 of those

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,930
are caused by speeding and speeding as a

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,860
primary factor in this

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,770
so this visualization up here

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,790
is showing Manhattan New York City where

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,860
uber operates and it's also illustrating

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,550
how we're using urban computing to

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,270
really provide insights into how people

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:15,540
are moving about a city so you can see

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:19,140
that there's there's Road segments

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,940
colored here and scatter plots of data

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,640
points so this is bringing that

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,170
heterogeneous collection of data from

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,780
different sources and combining it

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,880
together into a single visualization the

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,450
red dots here are traffic fatalities

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,380
from the US Department of Transportation

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,930
there's yellow dots that are also

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,870
bringing in data from the New York City

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:44,150
Police Department's and then the blue

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:48,300
Road segments blue yellow and red is

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:51,030
data that uber has processed from GPS

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,260
sensors GPS signals from our drivers

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,190
moving around the city combined together

00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:02,120
processed it anonymized it aggregated it

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:06,060
to be able to provide information about

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,130
average vehicle speeds down to a high

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,680
degree of granularity in both space and

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,620
time so this is zooming in on the site

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,080
of that accident Canal and Bowery Street

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,450
where we're seeing two sources of data

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,070
here and we see that certain road

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,010
segments here are

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,920
we can see that it's it's data combined

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,950
over down to Road segment granularity

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,480
and also hour by hour and we can see

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,070
that there's particular Road segments

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,320
here where we have significant speed

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,320
above the the speed limit all hours of

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,880
the day we can start to use that

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,560
information to see that there's other

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,970
similar provided insights into where

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,580
there's other similar parts of the city

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,710
that may be having we're seeing that

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,810
same type of vehicle speed behavior

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,210
maybe they don't have the same type of

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,850
traffic fatalities or other the other

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,530
sources of data there but transportation

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,810
decision makers and policy makers can

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,970
really use this data it's not only get

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,010
retrospective insight but also start to

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,710
use the visualization tools so I start

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,080
to explore how they can use this to find

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,380
other areas where they can impact

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,590
meaningful change so again that's just

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,580
one example of how we're exploring using

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,500
data acquisition data science

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,300
visualization simulation combining those

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,510
together into this theme of urban

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,060
computing ubers thinking about urban

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,300
computing more than just safety but also

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,620
congestion pollution increasing and

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,530
providing more equitable access to

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:42,880
transportation so I really want to talk

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,290
a little bit more about how we're doing

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,750
that and how we're doing that with open

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,570
source so the previous visualizations

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,320
are all created using Kepler GL for

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:56,200
cities so this is an open source

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,620
web-based visualization tool that we've

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:03,070
created it uber it's open it's free it's

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,890
fast it's easy to use it's web-based it

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,470
actually doesn't require any programming

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,480
to use so it's the customers for our

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,570
days of scientists engineers urban

00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,970
planners researchers Civic hackers

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,430
basically you can drag and drop data

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,680
into this web-based tool free and open

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,630
source web-based tool and powering it is

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,320
high-performance computer graphics based

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,990
WebGL code that's basically able to

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,790
render millions of data points in a

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,380
really high-performance way in the web

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,259
so that's Kepler gl4 cities and this is

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:45,020
what the previous visualizations were

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:47,150
were created with underlying Kepler GL

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,509
is a whole set of visualization

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,210
frameworks that are powering it so it's

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,030
kind of the foundation of boobers urban

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,030
computing platform these frameworks are

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,680
suited for a variety of applications

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,009
they're largely web based and they're

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,260
largely around just being able to

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,720
display data millions of data points

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,820
really performant lis in the web browser

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,370
and there's a lot of geo spatial

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,690
visualization use cases for this but you

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,900
can also see that they're powerful

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,789
enough to be applied to some related

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,620
areas that potentially related to urban

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,289
computing and transportation like

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,539
self-driving car visualization we've

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,090
just recently open sourced our

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,720
autonomous visualization system which is

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:37,030
a set of components and a visualization

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,030
standard for autonomous vehicle systems

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,870
the other aspect of this I want to touch

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,900
on is data and how Ebor is trying to

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,000
provide anonymized data for over two

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,130
billion trips to really help our urban

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,720
planners around the world so we're doing

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,780
that through our investments in what we

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
call that uber movement platform so this

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,849
is an open platform where we're

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,409
providing data for regulators

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,479
policymakers researchers Civic hackers

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:06,830
and we're doing this in a way that is

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,520
very privacy minded so we anonymize and

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:14,030
aggregate that data in a way so that the

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,650
regulators and policymakers can glean

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:20,810
useful insights for it and use it for

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,820
their urban computing needs so that's a

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,190
broad overview of some of the specific

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,900
technologies and specific open-source

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,229
software frameworks that we're building

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,539
software frameworks and tools as we've

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,300
built this technology we're starting to

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,709
see that we're getting like a

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,130
groundswell or attention from like a

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:41,300
community of developers who are noticing

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,990
this and starting to use it in their

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,270
applications so you know we're we're

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,210
seeing that through people act

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,100
of lis contributing participating in the

00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,960
conversation contributing code on our

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,810
open source github repos which is really

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,640
exciting to see we're really starting to

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,580
focus on fostering this and creating a

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,770
broader ecosystem around this through

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,960
really improving our documentation

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,880
making these things more accessible and

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,760
spreading awareness of them we're also

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,560
teaching courses in in data

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,510
visualization at universities engaging

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,210
with researchers and academic

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:24,440
institutions Civic hackers so that's

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,450
where we are right now I think we are we

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,460
could see a lot of potential in what

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,190
urban computing is and we know that open

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,980
source is at the core of this so we have

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,010
partnerships with governments external

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,890
companies researchers the open source

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,960
community but we really want to we see

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,630
the future a lot of potential in terms

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,750
of accelerating and expanding and

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,280
ecosystem around these tools so we're

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,710
exploring creating like a neutral

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,810
foundation to accelerate this using the

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,220
opening governance models as support and

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,190
guidance and help from the Linux

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,990
Foundation and the real goal of this is

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,200
to create a framework for the long term

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,020
growth sustainable sustainability

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,020
stewardship and technical improvement of

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,280
these tools and frameworks for urban

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,260
computing and so we can't do it alone

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,720
so we're here to talk about this start

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,060
to spread awareness of this and also ask

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,670
for interest about it so if you're

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,330
interested in helping with this we can't

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,280
do it alone please come and talk to us

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,230
you can drop us a line at the Linnaeus

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,890
foundation slash project / urban

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,110
computing and I think that there's a lot

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,420
of potential to really help cities and

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,060
citizens improve the lives of everybody

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,760
in the in our cities through through

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,530
really building this sustainable growing

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
ecosystem around urban computing in the

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,100
future thank you very much

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,399
[Applause]

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,810
thank you really you know one of the

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,269
things I love about this project is

00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,680
you've got an open-source set of

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:01,449
projects but you also have a data

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,160
sharing project which i think is really

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,379
really interesting and I think we're

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,589
gonna see a lot more of this in the

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:11,199
future but you're like an early adopter

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:14,800
Vanguard for taking data anonymizing it

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:17,259
sharing it so sort of open source but

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,220
applied to data so awesome stuff we look

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,720
forward to working with you thank you

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,689
much all right

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,420
so again I think if you look at it open

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:27,639
source open data open data is gonna be a

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,269
new big trend that we're gonna see more

00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,269
