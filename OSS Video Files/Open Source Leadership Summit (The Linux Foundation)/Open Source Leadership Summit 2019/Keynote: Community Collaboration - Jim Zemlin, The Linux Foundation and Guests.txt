all right everyone we're gonna stay on

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,359
track for the afternoon I noticed

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,859
there's less people in this room that

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,450
are out what's wrong with you people get

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,139
everyone sit you know when next time get

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,490
in here get in here the hallway track I

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,690
know this you know every year we get

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,609
people saying you know the best part

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,160
about this event is the hallway track

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
but this afternoon we're really gonna

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,350
make up for it we've got some really

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,349
cool announcements coming this afternoon

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,480
to follow on the already awesome

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,369
announcements we had this morning you

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,469
know again the continuous development

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,930
foundation the merger of the nodejs

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,070
foundation JavaScript foundation at

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,079
graph QL just so many amazing

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,309
announcements and we have even more to

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,640
come but I do want to get serious for a

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,070
minute with everyone here so you know

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,530
this this is an event where leaders from

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,719
the open source industry and community

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,520
all get together that hope that's why we

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,559
call it the open source Leadership

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,820
Summit and you know one of the things

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,710
that we're always concerned about is

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,990
you're part of open source is that

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,979
there's just an anti-establishment

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,420
Sensibility not like why could you go to

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,520
that meeting and I didn't get to go that

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,460
meeting and you know this is just one of

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,990
the few events the Linux Foundation does

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,170
for our members the rest of our events

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,729
are obviously open to everyone but the

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,420
conversation I want to have this

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,790
afternoon is as leaders in the industry

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,970
as it relates to open source in the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,570
community as open-source maintainer Zoar

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,750
very prominent developers we need to

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,430
sort of think about how we can make

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,070
something that has is so good that has

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,509
enriched ourselves enriched in others at

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,520
the same time something we all like to

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,490
talk about something this concept that

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,820
all of us are smarter than any one of us

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,680
how can we make that even better like

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,360
you know remember that IBM ad that I

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,340
showed this morning or that little kid

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,860
was 10 you know being communicated to

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,950
and learning from everyone well part of

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:11,009
the other part of open-source that is so

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,030
powerful is its adaptability and we have

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,910
some chance serious challenges

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,360
and I think I want to show another ad

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,750
from that series about some things that

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,800
we should think about this afternoon and

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,540
we roll the video there it is not the

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
strongest of the species that survive

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,709
nor the most intelligent but the one

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,709
most responsive to change

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,620
change is something that all of us have

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,499
to think about and more and more of

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,560
these days as open-source becomes a part

00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:52,299
and parcel to your business success -

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,920
literally the backbone of the internet

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:59,319
of our global economy something that not

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,620
only empowers us to do amazing things

00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,959
like the drones you saw this morning or

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,200
the new 5g solutions that are we coming

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,169
out of AT&T but it also is a

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,359
double-edged sword where if it isn't

00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,629
sustained properly if it's not

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,409
maintained by a massive collective

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,280
effort

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:24,549
the security and privacy of all of us is

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,769
also at risk and that's what I want to

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,310
talk to you all about this afternoon and

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,889
issue some challenges for this group so

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,579
that we can all collectively lead to

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:38,230
better sustained open-source and you

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,449
know I started the event this morning by

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,290
talking about open source sustainability

00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:47,169
and describing how great projects work

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,870
and they all work very very similarly

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,970
Linux being sort of the best example of

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,879
this but you know kubernetes and others

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,280
are also in this category you have this

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,430
amazing upstream project you know Linux

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,739
changes nine times an hour

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,720
it is the fastest growing most prolific

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,509
largest most successful open source

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,269
project ever and it is used not just to

00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:12,579
make products but it's used to power

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:15,239
almost every global Stock Exchange it's

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,889
used for systems that we

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,930
telecommunication systems all of the

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:24,310
internet systems that we rely on every

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,710
single day you know companies use open

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,150
source you know you don't build a GoPro

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,810
with your own operating system you take

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,539
Linux you implement it you may create a

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,120
lot of value and that value does get

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:41,169
reinvested most Linux kernel developers

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,610
today are professional developers most

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,990
of them are somewhere around the hallway

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,110
track here because they don't ever come

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,669
to the keynotes but they're pros

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:56,639
and this works you know the the idea of

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:59,620
a developer who's using Linux to run a

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,100
multi hundred million subscriber 5g

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,850
network in China for China Mobile is

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,500
providing not only labor back into the

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,720
Linux kernel project but more

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,910
importantly the innovation positive

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,460
feedback loop of understanding what is

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,610
actually like to run an 850 million user

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,490
global network that that information

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,520
that innovation gets put back into the

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,870
project in a really interesting not only

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,630
positive feedback loop of labor

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,600
economics but of innovation economics

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,590
and so the serious conversation we want

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,070
to have this afternoon is what happens

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:43,990
what are the implications when that

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:46,630
virtuous cycle does not work and we've

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,169
seen some recent and even not so recent

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,060
examples of of what ends up happening

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,470
everybody remembers heartbleed how many

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,870
people here remember heartbleed in the

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,910
in the open ssl project how many people

00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,110
here know that post heartbleed we

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,600
created something called the core

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,539
infrastructure initiative we paid the

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,760
two core maintainer x' of open SSL Andy

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,669
Paul Yahoo and Steve Henson three

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,370
hundred thousand dollars per year each

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,590
to work full-time on open a cell for

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,530
three years

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,380
they helped refactor that codebase put

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,050
down the bug backlog significantly

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,229
improves the shape of open SSL we paid

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,160
Chet Raimi to work on bash we worked

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:33,400
with Harlan down at the ntpd project to

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,169
pay him to work full-time on ntpd in

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,539
order to improve its security the

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:43,060
OpenSSH maintainer Theo de Raadt paid

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:44,860
him this is one of the most important

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,950
projects out there Theo had been kind of

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,250
going on his own these were important

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,810
things three four years later the

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,360
question is what lessons did we learn

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,490
about these projects that stand at the

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,510
intersection of critical to the privacy

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,270
and security of

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,790
all of us and truly troubled in terms of

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,550
resources in terms of the state of the

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,900
project that expose us to an Equifax

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,510
breach or a heartbleed or worse and the

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:18,190
unfortunate answer was very Tolstoy

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:20,080
esque that we generally found that most

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,060
healthy open-source projects were

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,150
similar but that there was just a

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,010
varying set of circumstances across all

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,500
of these different projects in terms of

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,480
why they broke down and how they broke

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,730
down and it could have been a labor

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,350
issue a personality issue a governance

00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,650
issue it could if I was just there were

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,140
so many different things we learned but

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,230
you know we we started to try and figure

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,510
out patterns one of the patterns is the

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,630
world itself isn't getting an early

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:53,680
warning signal here in a meaningful and

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,550
effective way the other thing that we

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,210
understand is that a huge amount of the

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:05,050
code we depend on is written by a bunch

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,720
of unsung heroes who maybe don't appear

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,960
on stage at a Linux Foundation event or

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,750
in front of 12,000 people at Kubb Khan

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
as Dan Khan incessantly reminds me

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,350
they're gonna have 12,000 people at

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,190
Kubek on the biggest open source

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,680
developer event ever but there's this

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,570
whole set of other developers and they

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,300
number in the thousands kind of working

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,640
in the background and I want to show you

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,160
what these folks look like you know they

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,140
could be at an open SSL

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,570
you know the the Steve Henson and Steve

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,000
marques for so many years maintained

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,990
open SSL and funded it through doing

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,990
Phipps compliance certification for to

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,550
help fund that project for pay a lot of

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,170
people were pretty scared to hear that

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,660
the Internet at one point in time was

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,200
essentially secured of by two guys named

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,650
Steve but there's a whole bunch of other

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,460
Steve's out there and Bob's and Sue's

00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:05,980
and Kristen's and Tom's and here's what

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,630
they look like code gets built like this

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,120
these days you choose a framework nodejs

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,950
Ruby Python you name it

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,870
you write your code you're writing a web

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,290
app whatever it is mobile app you name

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,760
it and then you use open source

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,200
libraries to solve problems right this

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,870
is what everybody does like like pull

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,250
down different NPM packages they write

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:33,160
this code right and most of this code is

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,290
open source and we know at the Linux

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,740
Foundation that the core nodejs

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:41,910
maintainer z' which we all work with

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,830
these are very special and interesting

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,960
folks who work on the core framework we

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,840
know who they are they're supported we

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,320
have the open Jas foundation we have

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:59,560
ways of doing that but what about these

00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:02,730
folks this long tail of developers who

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,620
work on essentially your dependencies

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,480
right when you build an application you

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,880
create these dependencies on all these

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,560
other packages out there that a whole

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
bunch of people are writing in some

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,550
cases independently in some cases

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,780
collectively this is who we need to

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,350
think about and it's not just code

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:26,670
that's being written here there are

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,860
things that are needed for healthy

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,410
open-source so that all of our code can

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,420
be better quality more robust more

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:40,660
secure and there are just certain things

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:45,310
that a rumor has it developers do not

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:48,850
like to do trying to think of a few of

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:53,620
them but there's a whole bunch of them

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:56,410
it turns out testing QA documentation

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,170
security audits dependency analysis and

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,350
so forth and you know as we were like

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,450
trying to figure out like how we could

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,840
improve this and trying to figure out

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,220
like why this was happening a very

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,140
prominent developer tipped me off that

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,520
there's actually a series of books that

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,650
explains some of the non code or some of

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,940
the dynamics around these things not

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,130
getting done in a lot of open source

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,300
projects I hadn't seen this series

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:28,290
before but I hear it's extremely popular

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,690
with a lot of developers I mean just

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,410
nobody likes to write tests you know

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:37,500
nobody likes to do a lot of this stuff

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,780
but this all boils down to one thing for

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,880
those projects that are critical to the

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,460
security integrity of the internet that

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,950
long tail of developers who work on

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,980
these dependencies that we all need that

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,240
they need more resources and we hear

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,030
this all the time

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,430
I showed this quote this morning a

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,300
developer wrote this you know talking

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,920
about you know listen it everyone thinks

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,440
you have to buy hardware but you know

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,990
who can afford to maintain all this

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,600
software it actually is real work how

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,460
can somebody do that for free does

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,660
anybody know like is anybody met this

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,660
developer know who it might be

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,850
yeah you feel you've heard me say this

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,670
uh

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:27,300
it was Bill Gates in 1976 in an open

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,490
letter to hobbyists describing how you

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,180
know this back then

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,560
software developers needed to get paid I

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:41,310
hear that bill did actually end up

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:43,020
getting compensated well or hurt but

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,180
here's another interesting thing is I

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,160
looked up you know I were like why why

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,930
is this happening why is it that

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,430
software developers aren't getting

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,380
compensated for a lot of this kind of

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,120
work and it turns out developers

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,480
actually is it are getting compensated

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,940
and it's a pretty good job four of the

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,760
top ten highest paying jobs in American

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,500
2018 based on median salary are software

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,000
related Enterprise architects software

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,270
development manager software engineering

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,400
managers are for architects I mean I saw

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,840
this I'm like yes developers are getting

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,600
paid in fact the only question I have

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,020
about this statistic is why corporate

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,530
counsel is number five I just don't get

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,200
that

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,640
I couldn't help myself I'm sorry if ever

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,700
there's an opportunity for a lawyer joke

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,130
I always take it

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:36,340
there's Dolan right there there's a

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:37,960
counsel right in the front here we also

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,780
do surveys every year on open source

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,460
jobs right and in 2018 the de Fant

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,210
demand for open-source developers is

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,300
actually extremely high like everybody

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:52,570
wants to hire open source developers

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,080
like I actually it's I get more phone

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:59,620
calls and emails about Jim do you know

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,750
someone who no see is a kernel developer

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,900
right you know like I just it's a

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,270
constant stream into my inbox for them

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,130
what's also interesting is that we

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,390
surveyed all of these folks who are open

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,360
source developers in a professional

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,770
setting and the overwhelming response

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,400
which I think is somewhat expected to

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:21,040
this audience was they love what they do

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,840
more than what they get paid and I think

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,750
part of that and there's a whole bunch

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,730
of academic research out of the MIT and

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,630
Harvard that backs this up which is that

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,640
the extrinsic value the money in open

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,630
source is one thing you gotta have it

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,150
but the intrinsic motivation of

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,760
mastering one's craft solving tough

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,100
problems about being a part of a

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,400
community bigger than yourself is this

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,680
is much more inspiring what's incredible

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,090
about it is that somehow we've managed

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,640
to marry the two where open-source

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,320
developers are not only like 87% of

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,420
hiring managers want more open source

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
talent want to pay that talent but you

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,170
get the same sense of community and

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,530
motivation and joint problem solving at

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:09,520
the same time which leads me to this the

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:12,700
paradox which is even though there are

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,960
more job opportunities than ever in

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,000
computer science in every aspect some

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,820
open-source maintainer is not all but

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,220
many are still not getting the funds

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:30,760
they need for their projects to thrive

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,160
why we've been thinking a lot about this

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,290
and there's a whole cottage industry

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,259
there are

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:42,120
tons of organizations that are trying to

00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:45,240
help solve this problem get pay grata

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,519
pay tide lift is an interesting one this

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,870
is a commercial software company assort

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,370
commercial service companies a bet

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,470
probably a better description that sort

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,540
of targets those long tail of developers

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,639
and you can subscribe to tide lifts and

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:03,240
you can get some kind of a support or

00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,680
some kind of commitment to maintain that

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,269
long tail of projects that you

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,040
particularly depend on as a single

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:16,440
enterprise there's lots of blockchain

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:19,230
and cryptocurrency related efforts those

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,480
maybe I'm a little more unclear about

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,819
whether a cryptocurrency related effort

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,540
is going to be effective I went back in

00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:30,089
red Lena's original email from 1991 hey

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,519
MINIX folks my name is Lena store walls

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,250
I'm building this operating system it's

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,440
more of a hobby we're having an initial

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,319
coin offering I've incorporated in the

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,019
Cayman Islands and if you get your

00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,630
credit card not sure if that one would

00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,170
work but hey you know like all of these

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,660
are good

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,690
everyone should be trying to figure out

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,180
ways to provide that same kind of

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,040
positive economic feedback loop that

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,829
makes open-source great and we did and

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,350
I'm going knows the answer to to what

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:03,300
any of these things will end up doing

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,929
some of them fail on the some of the may

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:10,110
succeed we just don't know but I think

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:11,850
that the real question here that this is

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,049
the challenge that I want to ask all of

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:17,520
you to think about is nobody's

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,549
questioning the developers should get

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,429
paid or not like they should and get

00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:25,290
paid more and those silent developers

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:29,220
that are working on stuff you depend on

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,850
we should pay them you know if they need

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,870
help

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,790
let's reach out and give it to them you

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,490
just have to be throwing money randomly

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,159
but reach a helping hand they're helping

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,049
you help them but I don't think that's

00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,090
the question we depend on these folks

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:48,770
that should get paid the real question

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:53,220
is what is our collective

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:57,030
responsibility to make sure open-source

00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,720
software projects thrive when is it more

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:03,510
than a helping hand when is it that we

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,530
all need to work together because I'm

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:11,100
something bigger is at stake and I want

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,770
to offer today a few theories on when

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,740
that might be the case I think we can

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,660
all agree that this is the first thing

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,300
that comes to mind this is what people

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,890
tell me more than you can possibly fit

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,860
account that when our collective privacy

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,970
and security is at risk

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,140
whence apache struts is only patched

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:39,030
whenever there's a vulnerability by

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:42,870
essentially one guy when open SSL is

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:45,030
floundering when open SSH which provides

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:49,290
secure communication between servers is

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:51,330
maintained by Pheo kind of an ism we

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,160
need to think about that we need to

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,630
think about what our responsibility is

00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,060
to fix that and that this is actually a

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,910
tough problem I know that because we've

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,440
given out millions and millions of

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:11,760
dollars to these projects and we decided

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,640
a year ago to take a deeper look and the

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,370
idea here was we needed to answer three

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,810
simple questions so that we could

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,240
understand when we have a collective

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,290
responsibility here the first question

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,000
is what is the most important shared

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,570
software in the world

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,920
and I'm not talking about open SSL every

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,170
time right they're a great example

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,310
they're the one everybody talks about

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:43,140
but I want to know who is collectively

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:47,510
running across everyone by vertical

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:51,060
industry by package by version number

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,890
based on some form of criticality

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,020
what are you running in production and

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,540
is it critical or not and when I say

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,380
critical or not is it Network facing

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:04,919
it's crypto involved give me the list

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,350
package version number criticality by

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,760
industry sector utilities retail

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:15,260
aerospace and defense financial services

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:19,890
that actually is an insanely difficult

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,140
answer to get right you would have to go

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,570
in and apply software composition

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,250
analysis tools to every company you

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,110
could possibly talk to to get a

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,480
statistical sample you would have to

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,980
anonymize and correlate that data by

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,260
package and version number you would

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,140
have to then come up with an algorithmic

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,200
way to come up with a criticality score

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,659
and then and only then can you get on to

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,070
the next question which is who wrote

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:49,289
this stuff right who is writing the most

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,539
critical software in the world and I'm

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,150
not talking just their github handle who

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,730
are these people because ultimately is

00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,260
people who are doing their this work who

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,360
are these maintainer zhh what are their

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,630
names where do they live what motivates

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,490
them what do they think about you can't

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,330
fix something unless the people who can

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,950
actually fix it are on board what's the

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,770
health of that community do they get

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,840
along with each other are they

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:18,450
experiencing financial problems what is

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,890
it if you can't figure out what the most

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,289
important software in the world isn't

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,840
who wrote it then you can't get to the

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:28,590
third question which is how do we help

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:31,350
those projects help become healthy and

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,900
more secure what kind of incentives we

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,500
can can we give them there isn't money

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,850
is it secondo engineers from any of your

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,559
companies who have some of the best

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,039
engineers in the world to go help these

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,750
people can we give them tools you know

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,549
Google probably has these amazing like

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,080
that fuzzing tools that have come out of

00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,960
some of the companies that all of you

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,580
work for the the application testing

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,610
tools and so forth are amazing

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,580
how can we apply these resources these

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,400
are the questions we need to ask this is

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,960
how we can solve the idea of open source

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,580
sustainability not just for the big

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,340
projects but for all projects which will

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,700
help all of us and these are really

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,980
tough questions and we want to answer

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:18,040
them we've engaged in a partnership

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,750
with Harvard University's lab for

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,630
innovation science at Harvard Business

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,450
School ah to create what we're calling

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,160
our census - so as part of our core

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,740
infrastructure initiative several years

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,620
ago we did a census of what the most

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,840
important software in the world is its

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,640
criticality score but we mainly did this

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,950
based on the Linux platforms out there

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,770
and we came up with you know gzip and

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,630
bash and open SSL on the usual suspects

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,179
but we need to go much bigger than that

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,390
we're working with software composition

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:52,390
analysis vendors people who actually

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,640
have this data in a statistical form who

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,070
are working with Harvard to anonymize

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,900
that because that information is not

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,340
something that you know people want to

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,040
share with the rest of the world but we

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,230
can anonymize and aggregate in a way

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,570
that gives us enough of an idea of what

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,640
these shared software packages are so

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,340
that we can get an idea I've been

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,169
shooting in the dark and then the Linux

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,820
Foundation is gonna work to do the next

00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,230
part figure out who these folks are we

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,910
are actually in a unique position at the

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,890
Linux Foundation we have some great

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,110
people on staff here Kate Stewart and

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,890
others who are working on what I like to

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,480
call open source archaeology going back

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,120
and looking at all these projects and

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,070
trying to track the provenance to the

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,710
people who actually wrote this so we can

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:39,070
understand what they think what they do

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,600
the communities are healthy or not so

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,610
this is something we have underway right

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,580
now and that's not even what we're

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,900
announcing today what we want to

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,059
understand is how we can affect change

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,040
once we get to the end of that third

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,850
question it's that third question that I

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,190
want to talk about today and this is

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,620
another one where I can't believe I'm

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:03,040
doing this but I'm throwing up yet again

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:06,090
another letter from Bill Gates turns out

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,090
the guy's super smart

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:12,379
back in January of 2002 he sent a note

00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:15,529
out to all employees at Microsoft about

00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:17,299
software security at the time Microsoft

00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,549
was having meaningful challenges

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,079
relative to the software quality and

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,940
security of its products that were sort

00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,089
of freaking out its customers if you

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,940
recall at that time and and you know

00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,349
Bill Gates said we're gonna create this

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,320
thing called the trustworthy computer

00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,659
computing initiative he worked with a

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,219
gentleman named Steve Lipner to

00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:38,959
implement it Steve has actually been

00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:40,369
helping us at the core infrastructure

00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,719
initiative he's a terrific guy if you

00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:45,169
ever get to hang out with Steve lifter I

00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:47,149
highly recommend it but the note cut to

00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,619
the chase was we're gonna take secure

00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,579
coding classes we're gonna test our code

00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,649
we're gonna read all the code we're

00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:53,469
gonna audit the code we're gonna create

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:56,450
this entirely new process for

00:24:53,469 --> 00:25:00,109
application security or in his words

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:02,779
trustworthy computing and it worked

00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:06,109
Tech Microsoft's code actually got quite

00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:08,619
a bit better uh and the question for all

00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:11,809
of us is that worked at Microsoft

00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:14,119
because Bill Gates had one last line

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,499
that wasn't explicitly in the letter and

00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,779
I may be like embellishing a little bit

00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:19,219
here but like the implication as far as

00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,019
I could understand from the letter is if

00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:26,259
you don't do this you're going to be

00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:31,779
fired we don't have that an open source

00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:31,779
no you can't fire anyone trust me I know

00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:38,239
what we need to do is change our culture

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,070
we need to create a culture of secure

00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:42,499
coding and I don't have all the answers

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,440
today I'm asking you I'm challenging

00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,789
this group to help me with these answers

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,019
we've tried in the core infrastructure

00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:50,269
initiative to come up with some

00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:51,950
incentive structures we have a badging

00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:54,320
program for our core infrastructure

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,729
initiatives where I think a couple

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,679
hundred two hundred and fifty odd

00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:59,869
projects have passed a couple thousand

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,639
are applying where people come in and

00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:03,469
they have to demonstrate that they take

00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,690
secure coding and the maintenance of

00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:08,089
their projects seriously it's not

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,409
security theater you have to really do

00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:14,509
this work and that has initially gotten

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:16,369
some positive outcomes we require this

00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:18,649
for many of our projects I think the CNC

00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,020
F requires us for any project in the

00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:22,180
cloud native computing

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,810
upon foundation in order to graduate to

00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:28,200
their top level but 250 projects a

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:32,710
couple thousand there we need to do more

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,140
right the other thing that we need to do

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:39,300
is not just provide incentives but we

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,500
need to continually focus on diversity

00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,510
maybe one of the reasons and I don't

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,640
know if there's an exact causal effect

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,670
here that this stuff is happening is

00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,100
because we're too myopic then we come

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,870
out here we're all in the hallway track

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
and never come to hear me speak it's

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,210
really annoying and you're talking to

00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,740
each other all the time but we need

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,690
diversity from different cultures and we

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,680
need diversity from underrepresented

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,320
communities

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,540
I showed this this morning I'm showing

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,040
it again this is not a good statistic

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,530
and it is there is no doubt that diverse

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,960
communities create better outcomes that

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,850
if we get more people's perspectives we

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,000
are going to be stronger and we need to

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,920
work on this that is what we've been

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,650
thinking about at the Linux Foundation a

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,410
lot how can we promote better

00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,870
application security create a culture of

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,600
secure coding how can we provide more

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,790
resources how can you all provide more

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,730
resources to these projects and how can

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:46,570
we get more diversity into our

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,840
communities all at once and so what

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,570
we've done is built a software platform

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,480
called community bridge community bridge

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,940
is a tool that we're offering to

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,790
open-source communities these

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,640
communities who need help to provide

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,920
them with resources and help solve their

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,780
key challenges how can we help provide

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,650
funding to these projects how can they

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:14,070
make requests to everyone to help them

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:17,220
how can we give them security visibility

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:21,010
to their dependencies how can we provide

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,220
secure enterprise-grade security tools

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:28,750
to these open source developers and

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:32,020
finally how can we match people with

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,760
funding requests to improve security in

00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,870
a way

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:42,040
promotes diversity so how could we for

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:44,950
example fund an in mentorship program

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,860
where mentees come in to the Linux

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,620
kernel project and work on the huge bug

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,460
backlog of some are security

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,710
vulnerabilities of some are just

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,180
outright bugs that Google is publishing

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,040
every single day it's really impressive

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:01,120
list Greg complains about it all the

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,790
time how could we provide funding so

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,240
that those mentees were from diverse

00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:10,710
backgrounds pair them with mentors in an

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,780
automated way and then have you all

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,480
companies that depend on open-source

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:19,930
offer job interviews to those mentees at

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,350
the end of their program so that they

00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:27,130
could find jobs with good pay and health

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:33,090
care benefits and labor rights fund open

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:36,070
source projects disclose fix bugs

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,100
underwrite diversity more diversity

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:42,250
better security more resources all at

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:45,610
once that's what we've built it's

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:48,730
targeted for use Linux Foundation

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,530
projects but mainly for those critical

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:54,820
and emerging under resourced projects

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:58,180
that we all really use and depend on for

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,060
the other 78 million projects on github

00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,570
for your private repos you're on your

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,130
own we're not saying that we're gonna

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,190
close the door forever but like that's

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,710
not our focus today here's what we're

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,390
offering the first module that we're

00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,110
offering in this platform is a funding

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:19,660
platform this is a crowdfunding platform

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,450
that will allow maintainer x' to come in

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,370
register on the platform raise funds for

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,710
their projects set a set of funding

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,710
goals the Linux Foundation is going to

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,370
provide matching grants to underwrite

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,140
the goals for those projects will have a

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,940
accounting transparent ledger where

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,730
projects can be reimbursed through an

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,320
expense management application we'll be

00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,890
able to fund these through not only

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,390
credit cards right over the internet but

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,059
also through purchase orders and

00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,460
recurring

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,679
commitments from any one of you because

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,529
the Linux Foundation has purchasing

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,299
relationships with over 1500 technology

00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:58,730
companies worldwide who are dependent on

00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,399
open-source we're also providing

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,899
standards and best practices for those

00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,690
projects as they come in and make

00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:08,929
funding requests do you have a CI batch

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,330
do you have a code of conduct policy in

00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,279
place you have a modicum of governance

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,470
all of this could be in the funding

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,899
module in addition we're providing

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,809
security visibility and enterprise-grade

00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:22,850
security tools to these projects we're

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:25,490
providing a commercial-grade dependency

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,499
analysis tool will be doing

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,840
vulnerability detection for all these

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,570
projects there will be a way that you

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,470
can literally go in click on

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,169
vulnerabilities through the dependency

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,480
analysis and remediate them through

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:41,600
suggested remedies right in the

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,970
application we've integrated with bug

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,399
bounty programs in order to underwrite

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,899
and provide bug bounty programs for open

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,029
source projects that wouldn't normally

00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:50,929
be able to stand up a bug bounty program

00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:53,779
on their own

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:55,759
we'll provide metrics about the project

00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,710
metrics of how they're spending their

00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,389
resources who's participating in it what

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,700
their bug backlogs our diversity

00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:03,909
statistics and so forth we're even

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,779
providing static code analysis

00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:07,759
particularly this is important to the

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:11,200
Linux kernel project so that we can bind

00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,840
bugs quicker and fix them faster

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,629
finally our community bridge people

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,049
component helps with this diversity

00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:23,600
issue and brings new blood into open

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,940
source in an automated way from any

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,519
country on earth from anyone with any

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,059
background who has the skills to come in

00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:36,139
and give it helping hand be paired with

00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:38,360
a mentor be given a shot to succeed and

00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,710
have a career through participating in

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,590
some of the most important open-source

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:45,559
projects in the world projects can go in

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,330
set financial goals maybe do a security

00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,369
scan and say hey we got to fix all this

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,169
stuff they can then set up the skills

00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,389
they need to solve those problems they

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:56,419
can invite mentors from their community

00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:59,360
who automatically sign up as mentors

00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,190
through a web UI publish what they're

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,280
looking for

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,430
the

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,680
mentors have a set of guidelines and

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:10,100
selection criteria that they can all set

00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,590
up in an automated way mentees can

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,990
create profiles of their skills they can

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,320
take tests in order to show and

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:20,930
demonstrate those skills they mentors

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,460
themselves can set up timelines whether

00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:26,630
they want to do a three month or maybe a

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:30,560
six month program then finally employers

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:33,380
can sign up to either underwrite those

00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:37,160
mentorship programs or even more

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,290
importantly get qualified candidates at

00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,740
the end of those mentorship programs

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:46,940
that you can interview for jobs at your

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,040
firm I'm not the hire but if you sign up

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,650
we'd like you to give those people a

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:57,340
shot at an interview so your companies

00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:00,800
and organizations can all participate

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:04,010
you can support your stack we have an

00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,980
integration with stack shared IO that

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,540
shows through a crowd-sourced way which

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,370
of your companies are using what open

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,020
source and how you can support it you

00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,690
can find new diverse talent sign up to

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,850
the mentoring program you can monitor

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:22,159
progress through the dashboard and more

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,530
the linux foundation is also taking the

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,350
lead on supporting developers and this

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:30,830
is the challenge I want to offer out to

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:33,520
all of you today we are going to be

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:36,740
providing matching grants for the first

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,020
100 mentees and mentors through this

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:41,659
program we're structuring the mentorship

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,620
program so that mentees will for a

00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:48,290
three-month in the program receive

00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:51,380
$5,500 stipend plus a $500 travel

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,140
stipend to participate in a three-month

00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,370
program for the kernel community we're

00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,470
not even gonna bother with the match

00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:01,160
we're just gonna outright fund some

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,560
mentees right off the bat second thing

00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,710
we're doing is every dollar goes to the

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,270
developer for the first 10 million bucks

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,730
meaning we're gonna eat the stripe fees

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,670
we're not gonna charge any kind of fee

00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,130
we're not doing this you know there's no

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,950
IPO at the end of the Linux on day

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:20,650
rainbow here we want to fix and help

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,680
these communities right every dollar

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:26,190
goes to the developer we want it we've

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,160
hired a new Linux Foundation fellow our

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:33,190
third Linux kernel fellow

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:38,680
where is shua kaneshiro there she is all

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:40,690
right we stay right there it's super

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,880
happy to have you on board

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,799
she will facilitate the kernel

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,319
fellowships and other fellowships to

00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:49,839
help us make sure we get this right I

00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:52,630
think she's just uniquely suited as a

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,329
developer in a community that's kinda

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,160
hard core it's a tough community to be

00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:00,970
in and she is one of the top people in

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,609
that community uh we already have folks

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:07,210
who want to sign up we want to spend

00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:10,720
this week signing you up as well come in

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:12,640
and participate if you are dependent on

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,799
a long tail of projects that aren't

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,569
represented in current foundation or

00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:18,789
wherever you're working on we can

00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:21,309
provide you a path to provide those

00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:24,819
grants because in addition to charging

00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,650
no fees for the first ten mill matching

00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:31,119
grants for the first hundred mentors and

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:34,329
mentees we are also doing a five hundred

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:38,710
thousand dollar matching grant so if any

00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:41,589
of you want to set up a grant for

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:45,069
projects that need help let's say you

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:47,200
just a really dependent on a certain NPM

00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,589
package that's kind of struggling or you

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,839
want to help open SSL or whatever it is

00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:55,660
give us a list give us an amount of

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:59,200
money and we will match that dollar for

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:02,289
dollar up to the first 500k I hope to

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,829
leave this event this week with at least

00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:10,210
a million dollars to help out these

00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:13,500
projects all pay have better application

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:17,829
security more resources and more

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:21,430
diversity all at the same time that is

00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,750
the goal that's not the goal for me or

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,000
for the Linux Foundation that's the goal

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,710
for you

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,040
do this together we built the platform

00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:32,110
to do this together now we didn't build

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,700
this thing all by ourselves we've got

00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,280
some folks here today who helped us

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,220
build it as well

00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,440
so our launch partners are hacker one

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,800
they've integrated the platform with

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,180
hacker Juan Martin Miko's is here today

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,010
we've integrated with Meetup

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,280
let's say you want to fun to meet up

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:54,730
your community and maybe small and we

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,900
need just a couple thousand dollars to

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,180
do a meet-up because we have a couple

00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,250
hundred people coming here you can go in

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,230
integrate due expense reimbursement all

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,090
through meetup calm and community bridge

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,370
to get that done sneak a

00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,840
commercial-grade security and software

00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,940
composition and Alice to will helped us

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,940
build out the commercial grade security

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,070
functionality sourced is helping with

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,010
static code analysis and other security

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:21,250
tools and stack share is helping us

00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:25,770
identify through crowdsourcing what open

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:30,250
source projects people are using but

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:34,060
before I get to that I want to show you

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,710
that this is actually real this is

00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,970
something that we're opening up to all

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,730
of you this week we're gonna do a

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:42,820
two-week closed beta and then it's done

00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,350
we're gonna open it up to the world this

00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,780
is something that we've already built

00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:49,240
let's show this is gonna be a little bit

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,010
of a long video and like I don't know

00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,960
what happened shubra where are you

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,300
shubra who was right over your stand-up

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,200
Shubra Shuba and our development team

00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:04,510
have done an amazing job giving my hand

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:06,400
building this thing out sure bro weirdly

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:10,210
weighted to the very last minute to

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,060
create this demo video I've never heard

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,070
of that before in a software demo but we

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,770
did a quick video of this not all the

00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:20,170
data and this thing is real we've cut it

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,690
before we're releasing the actual tool

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,920
DNA so when you go in and log in after

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,720
this and you want to check it out

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,480
there's going to be gated access will

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,040
give you password but obviously there

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,910
would be a different set of data and

00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,230
then what you're gonna see here but

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,430
let's let's check it out let's check out

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,430
the platform and see how it works

00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,140
the world of open-source is not just

00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,000
about engineering and technology it's a

00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,400
complex network of people and

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,710
organizations driving collective

00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,440
innovation to solve problems and create

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:53,530
shared value community bridge is a

00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,870
collaboration hub with the tools project

00:39:53,530 --> 00:40:00,100
and the community at large needed to

00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:02,260
grow and thrive funding funding provides

00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,570
a simple and transparent service for

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:10,720
individuals and organizations to back

00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:11,320
open source projects and groups to get

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,390
started

00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,820
maintainer x' can add their projects by

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:19,969
providing some basic information

00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,969
[Music]

00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:34,120
[Music]

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:37,340
the contributors they wish to support

00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,340
[Music]

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,460
and their desired fundraising goals

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,440
providing a transparent view of how this

00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,890
project intends to use the funds they

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:57,850
are requesting 20% will be allocated to

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,850
development 20% to marketing

00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,240
once approved a project can be funded by

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,250
individual backers and sponsoring

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,880
organizations through a recurring

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,590
commitment or one-time donations

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,900
invoicing support is also available to

00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:22,700
sponsors all across the world for larger

00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:24,500
donations the Linux Foundation has taken

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,290
an initiative to waive all applicable

00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,480
platform fees and even payment processor

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,130
fees for the first 10 million dollars

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,580
raised through the platform

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,650
hence 100% of the funds raised till we

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,020
reach the goal goes directly into the

00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,520
hand of the maintainer

00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,650
we want to set the precedent and

00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,390
encourage large corporate donors to

00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:53,359
follow lead for the growth of the

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:55,550
community beneficiaries are invited to a

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,590
project specific expensive.i policy

00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,900
where they can submit receipts for

00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:05,150
expenses and invoices for development

00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:07,490
effort maintained errs are the first

00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,619
line approvers validating that the

00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,740
submitted expenses are reasonable and

00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,660
legitimate once approved community

00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,790
bridge administrative staff will verify

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,500
funds are available and that reports

00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,470
meet regulatory compliance before

00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,359
releasing funds to the beneficiaries the

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,119
Linux Foundation will process necessary

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,349
tax documents for anyone who donates or

00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:33,080
receives funds all transactions

00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:35,240
donations and expenses alike are tracked

00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,620
and are fully visible to all in a

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,130
transparent ledger

00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:43,809
[Music]

00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:48,099
community bridge also supports meetups

00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:53,680
and even scholarships for attending LF

00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:55,960
event people money alone will not solve

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,880
sustainability we need to attract the

00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,369
right talent to support and grow the

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,769
project community bridge provides a

00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,410
matchmaking service for projects mentors

00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:09,339
mentees and employers to create a

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:11,559
sustainable growth model like funding if

00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:13,960
a project hasn't already been added a

00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,590
maintainer can simply provide some basic

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:22,190
information

00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:24,810
[Music]

00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,760
specify the skills and interest areas

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,770
they are looking for invite the

00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:34,560
community mentors to teach and advise

00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:38,910
newcomers and how often or long the

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,770
mentoring programs would run finally

00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,930
communicate what is expected from

00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,910
prospective candidates and a list of to

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:48,030
do screening tasks before they can be

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,830
considered once approved the project is

00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,350
available for accepting applications

00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:54,220
from prospective mentees and funds from

00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:57,380
sponsors and potential employers

00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,380
[Music]

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,890
individuals interested in growing their

00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,720
skills and being mentored can get

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,660
involved at any time by creating a

00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,470
profile and identifying their skills and

00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,470
interest areas

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:25,000
[Music]

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:27,220
it's interested and applicable they can

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,830
also sign up for diversity scholarship

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,020
opportunities the Linux Foundation is

00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,300
taking a lead on creating a more open

00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,520
and diverse community and will be

00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,530
providing a dollar-for-dollar match for

00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:43,750
the first 100 diverse mentees once the

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,580
profile is created candidates are Auto

00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,800
matched with projects looking for

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,290
similar skillset and interests as theirs

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,900
they can apply to any project of their

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:54,910
liking though applying is a one-click

00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,280
process but to finalize their

00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,100
application candidates must complete the

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,140
tests assigned to them these are the

00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,970
same screening tests that the project

00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,130
manager defined and could include

00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:10,180
writing a cover letter or submitting a

00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:12,310
full request for a coding challenge not

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,130
to be left out a critical piece of the

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:17,260
puzzle are the mentors these are skilled

00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,510
and experienced contributors who will be

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,180
responsible for advising and guiding the

00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,220
candidates in the program maintainer z'

00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,800
can invite mentors based on need and

00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,400
availability and often plays a role

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,400
themselves

00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:36,009
once invited mentors are asked to build

00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:38,079
a simple profile to showcase their

00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:41,589
knowledge and experience to prospective

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,839
mentees the goal is to feature these

00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:46,689
hero developers who educate and inspire

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:53,499
our community whose tireless efforts

00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:55,869
make this possible finally there are

00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:58,209
many organizations that not only thrive

00:45:55,869 --> 00:46:01,419
from open source technologies but who

00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:03,519
also foster and participate we want

00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:05,769
mentees graduating from the program to

00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,929
have viable career options which allow

00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:11,140
them to remain active contributors and

00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:13,689
grow the project to this end we

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,640
encourage organizations of all sizes to

00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:19,049
get involved first through funding the

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,459
mentorships but not just and their

00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:23,829
organizations can benefit from community

00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:26,199
bridge by hiring program graduates and

00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:28,059
employing them to support the projects

00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,159
they depend on they can show their

00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:31,719
interest in the project or specific

00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,329
skill areas they are looking to support

00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:38,109
and commit to providing job interview

00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:40,149
opportunities security the goal of this

00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:42,249
service is to provide visibility and

00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:44,319
actionable data for maintained errs and

00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:46,929
funders so that they can make informed

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:49,599
decisions on areas to develop or aware

00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:51,789
to fund vulnerability reports are

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,429
generated by a daily scan of the project

00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:56,319
repositories and the dependent projects

00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:59,889
and libraries mapped via project

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:04,179
manifest supported languages are no tjs

00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:07,329
Ruby Java Python Scala golang

00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,579
and docker containers defects and their

00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:12,759
severity can't be tracked over time when

00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:15,159
injected looking deeper we discover a

00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:17,109
host of security defects some of which

00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,929
are fixable by a simple upgrade to a

00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:21,579
library or packaged version and some of

00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,759
which we don't have a simple published

00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:26,319
fix and need to change the codebase

00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:28,499
maintainer know their code best and

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:31,209
should analyze for any false positives

00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:34,239
triaging the defects we can find

00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:35,020
associated CBE's common vulnerability

00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,260
exposure

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,050
and cwe's common weakness enumerations

00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,150
these vulnerabilities and weaknesses are

00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:46,300
directly linked to the research in the

00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,900
national vulnerability database in the

00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,630
CDE

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,550
there can be simple fixes identified for

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,000
example just the upgrade of the

00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,410
dependent library to a specific version

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,990
real-world evidences of this issue are

00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,540
also published sourced from hackers or

00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,910
fellow developers clicking on the hacker

00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,880
1 report we can find a bug captured

00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,890
during a bug bounty program even steps

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,950
to reproduce the bug have been provided

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,900
by the hacker similarly we are able to

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:18,910
access the research associated with

00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:20,710
weaknesses cwe's linked to the NBD the

00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,780
service is also designed to provide

00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,850
early warning to vulnerabilities which

00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:28,360
have been detected but may not have been

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,850
logged into the NDB yet triaging another

00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,240
issue where there was no easy upgrade

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,610
path based fix we get to see PRS from

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,060
fellow developers which you can use as a

00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:42,490
potential fix however our goal is to

00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,710
just provide recommendations on possible

00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,750
remedies to the issues and leave the

00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:50,140
actual fix to the discretion of the

00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:52,270
maintainer x' we can find all upstream

00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,270
direct and transitive dependencies based

00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,880
on daily scans of the project repos each

00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,310
dependent library or package is listed

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,620
into an app dependency tree when

00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,840
auditing the app stack this data is very

00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:08,830
handy to validate issues around

00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:11,620
incorrect build and mapping the root

00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:14,080
cause of the security defects as a

00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:16,180
funder or user of this project you can

00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,640
view all the different licenses in the

00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,920
stack the most interesting part of this

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,650
data is that we also determine if a

00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,530
dependent library package or project is

00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:29,440
already onboard the funding platform if

00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:31,450
so as a funder you can choose to back

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,310
the dependent package along with the

00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:36,520
master project you are currently looking

00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:39,100
to fund this creates a network effect of

00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,710
sorts and sponsors can fund or back an

00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,119
entire stack instead of just a project

00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,759
to enhance the sustain

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,700
ability of the ecosystem for select

00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:50,740
languages like C and C++ and in

00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,710
particular for projects that operate at

00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:56,109
the root level example Linux kernel and

00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,630
don't have dependencies listed in

00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:59,470
manifests we provide static code

00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,349
analysis

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:05,559
this is an early feature and we plan to

00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:08,829
expand support fee on C and C++ to all

00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:11,109
major languages you can find a detailed

00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:13,599
list of issues detected by the static

00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:16,269
code analyzer available for the project

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,400
maintainer x' to review maintainer

00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:21,099
review is needed to weed out false

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,999
positives which may not be applicable or

00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:26,799
handled elsewhere in the code base

00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:28,809
exploring a detected issue you can see

00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,869
the code level details where the issue

00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:33,910
is manifested static code analysis

00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:36,880
doesn't just capture security defects

00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:39,609
but all potential performance level for

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,279
example memory leak security level and

00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:45,130
code level defects for example null

00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:47,349
pointers projects can allocate funds

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:49,809
towards running a bug bounty program and

00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:52,059
hackers all around the world can submit

00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:55,299
real-world reproducible bugs that are

00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:57,480
validated for authenticity you can see

00:50:55,299 --> 00:51:00,789
summary metrics around program details

00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,509
bounty amounts bugs detected and hackers

00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:06,730
paid etc anyone can view publicly

00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:08,920
disclosed bug overviews for the project

00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,900
but maintainer x' have privileged access

00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,380
to the detailed full disclosure

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,900
information we provide crowd-sourced

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,299
usage metrics about the project these

00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,369
metrics include companies and individual

00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:24,220
apps using the project as part of their

00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:26,440
stack this information is gathered from

00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,539
users who have voluntarily produced

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,819
conformation around the use within their

00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:33,910
private enterprise or public community

00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:36,009
environments although there is no

00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,140
concrete guarantee of this data being

00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:41,019
accurate due to the voluntary nature of

00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,970
it it does provide indication to funders

00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:47,819
about the adoption of the project and

00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:47,819
its impact across the industry at large

00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:55,340
alright thank you for bearing with me on

00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:57,800
that I wanted to make sure that we

00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,870
this is real that you can take advantage

00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:03,530
of it today again we're gonna do a

00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:05,510
two-week closed beta and then we're

00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,460
gonna release this to everyone to

00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,710
participate on I want to take the next

00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,590
few minutes to thank the folks that

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,210
we've co-developed this with one of the

00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,820
things that makes this possible and one

00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,850
of the best parts about the being at the

00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:24,790
Linux Foundation is we've built this in

00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:28,070
a modular way that is very API driven

00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:29,690
meaning that we are not an organization

00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,720
that's going to build how to commercial

00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,340
software composition analysis and

00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,050
security vulnerability tool we're gonna

00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,760
partner for that we're not going to

00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,890
build out a bug bounty program because

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,410
that's a lot of work and we don't have

00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:44,210
the network we're gonna partner with a

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,090
whole bunch of folks and I want to bring

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:49,490
them up on stage in a couple minutes but

00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,820
before we do that I want to bring up our

00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:55,070
newest Linux kernel fellow schewe to

00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,890
talk about the mentorship program she'll

00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,300
come on up and talk to me about what

00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,810
we're doing with the kernel community

00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:05,520
please welcome our newest fellow

00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,520
[Applause]

00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:12,140
so tell us about you know what we're

00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:14,540
doing I think you already have posted a

00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,980
blog post about this probably like we

00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,470
wanted you to wait but the last few

00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,910
minutes maybe but tell us about the

00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:23,090
mentorship program for the kernel

00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:26,360
community and about how you came to come

00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:29,120
to the LF so I'm really excited to be

00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,150
here when Jim asked me to come and work

00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:35,900
on the mentorship program at LF I'm like

00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:38,030
us I want to do this because I've been

00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,920
working with in open source and got

00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:44,510
involved doing my journey doing Android

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,310
mainlining the Android code and then

00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:50,330
went on to do other broader initiative

00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:52,280
things such as helping Greg crow Hartman

00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:55,310
with stable release maintenance and then

00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,130
also kernel self-test maintenance the

00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:01,330
broader things I gravitate towards them

00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:04,730
partly because it's important to have

00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:07,400
such as Linux is foundation piece for a

00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:12,140
lot of the ecosystem it's important to

00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:16,030
have the foundation strong when so the

00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:18,020
important piece of that is we have

00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:21,860
maintained errs we have lots of

00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:24,830
developers maintainer have a critical

00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:27,820
subsystems they need help so we want to

00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:30,560
continue to bring new talent and new

00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,420
developers into the ecosystem kernel

00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,300
programming is complex it is a large

00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,510
subsystem large subsystems and it's

00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:42,170
large and it is it's important for

00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:45,290
mentors maintainer x' to be mentors in

00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:47,990
helping the new generation of leaders to

00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:50,660
grow and continue to sustain the

00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:53,300
ecosystem so that's why this is really

00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:56,030
I'm excited about this because I want to

00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,630
do this stuff and so we're gonna we read

00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:02,750
Soph the first five mentees on the Linux

00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,820
Foundation so its three-month programs

00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,670
six thousand dollars each you get a

00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,770
fifty five hundred dollar a payment and

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,840
a five hundred dollar a travel stipend

00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,540
and they're gonna be you're going to be

00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,570
leading the charge to get these kernel

00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,730
developers to act as mentors and to get

00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,500
these diversity Canada

00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:22,090
I should mention we are only going to

00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,190
pay for the first five that our

00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:26,920
diversity candidates if any of you want

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:29,109
to pay for additional mentees we would

00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,300
love to work with you go into community

00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:33,730
bridge and fund it but you're gonna be

00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,130
leading that charge yes yeah so today

00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,680
I'm asking mentees to come and join and

00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:41,109
mentors to come to guide all these

00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,600
mentees mentees coming in and we have

00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:46,660
this year we are going to be doing two

00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,480
full-time meant mentorship programs

00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:52,270
summer upcoming summer and then fall and

00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,619
one part-time we do want to include

00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:56,080
part-time because there are a lot of

00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:57,690
people that cannot spend full-time doing

00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,820
the work so we would like to include

00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:03,400
people that can only spend partner so

00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,640
next year we want to increase that to

00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,650
three full-time programs and two

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,540
part-time yeah we really want to move

00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,130
the needle on this you know when you and

00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,359
I first started talking or like hey

00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:15,820
listen we can partner with organizations

00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:18,060
all over the world bring diverse

00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:23,920
candidates in you know quash that

00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:25,900
relatively large bug backlog yeah and we

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,540
want to do that and we want to improve

00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:31,300
the kernel quality also make the

00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,369
strengthen the diversity and actually a

00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,710
diverse people into the community and

00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:38,740
strengthen it at the same time and then

00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:42,190
also we want to be able to train the

00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:44,350
kernel candidates saying you know kernel

00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:47,140
down occurs to make them available for

00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:49,450
the community partners so that is also

00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,210
very important so new job candidates for

00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,920
you if we can improve the kernel create

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:56,859
more diversity in the community and long

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,290
term leaders and find these folks jobs

00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:01,830
that would be a great outcome thank you

00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,830
so much

00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:08,289
so we've also been working with some

00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:10,180
partners to help understand the

00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:12,509
requirements of open source program

00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,069
offices in terms of what they need to

00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:17,559
create mentorship programs for projects

00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:19,960
that they support and to provide grant

00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:22,869
writing in to that end Remi cost maker

00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,130
from Twitter has been helping us out and

00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:26,289
we'd like to I'd like to invite him up

00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,970
on stage to talk about his perspective

00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:29,769
on community bridge and what Twitter is

00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:44,079
going to be doing with it Remi come on

00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:46,509
up all right hi there everybody what's

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,660
good open source Leadership Summit my

00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:51,130
name is Remi - cause maker and I help

00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,079
hackers work together use their powers

00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:56,200
for good I've been doing that for a

00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,759
while now and most recently I helped to

00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,789
run the open source program office at

00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,789
Twitter Twitter maybe you've heard of it

00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:05,019
is the social network it's what's where

00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:08,140
people go to find out what's happening

00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:09,970
in the world and it turns out that open

00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,940
source is a very important part of our

00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:14,829
origin story open source has been baked

00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,489
into the DNA of Twitter since the

00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:20,140
beginning you know everything from our

00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:23,380
micro-services architecture our build

00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:27,069
tools even our emoji our released open

00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:30,910
source so we have a broad set of

00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:33,900
concerns and we are committed at Twitter

00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:36,549
to improving sustainability and

00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,470
diversity and open source and the

00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:41,200
community bridge project this

00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:43,119
partnership helps to align a lot of

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,670
different things it helps to align

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:48,369
upstream mentors with downstream

00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:51,339
participants it helps to integrate

00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:54,519
third-party services that a lot of us in

00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:56,349
Osmos tend to depend on it helps to

00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:58,059
improve the transparency of where

00:58:56,349 --> 00:59:01,239
projects are spending their time and the

00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:04,029
resources it helps to align and provide

00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:06,430
incentives and ultimately it builds

00:59:04,029 --> 00:59:09,489
trust which is one of the most important

00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:11,190
things we have sort of a thesis in the

00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:12,560
open source program office at Twitter

00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,130
and by

00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:19,370
I mean mostly because brought it to it

00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:25,190
the idea is is that to grow anything you

00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:28,040
need three things heat light love it's a

00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:29,540
little sappy but it's true right

00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,580
in open source there's no guarantee that

00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,160
any of the seeds that you plant will

00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,810
grow but you can provide the best

00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,190
environment through which for those

00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:42,560
seeds to grow and that's each of those

00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,150
things the heat which is the activity

00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,430
the resource is the time that you invest

00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,840
directly the light which is the

00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,340
visibility that you bring to the

00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,230
projects and the community of people

00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,480
doing the important work and then the

00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,640
love which is the support the culture

00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,200
and a lot of the kinds of things that

00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,810
we're hoping to bring through

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,680
initiatives like community bridge so

00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:05,510
over the next year or so Twitter is

01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,130
going to be experimenting with this

01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,480
platform we're really excited to work

01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,580
with the partners we're really excited

01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,190
and thankful for the invitation Jim to

01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,420
be a part of this and you know we're

01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:16,250
gonna need all the help that we can get

01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,260
we're gonna ease into it we're gonna

01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,090
start small with some of our healthiest

01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,190
communities we're gonna ramp up with

01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:24,530
some mentors some folks from the inside

01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,300
that are willing to help because it goes

01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,890
beyond just throwing money at the

01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:31,580
problem we have to grow the community

01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:33,350
you know we don't just have you know

01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,540
it's not just a free writing problem

01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,880
it's a community problem and we need to

01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,560
build the operations and support for

01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,910
those resources to go where they need to

01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,190
go and be transparent and build trust

01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:44,780
and community bridges one of the ways

01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,910
that we can do that and we're excited to

01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,390
partner so thank you Jim thanks Tony

01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:52,540
really appreciate it absolutely all

01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:57,700
right that's not at all

01:00:52,540 --> 01:01:00,070
so guy Johnny from sneaked we couldn't

01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,590
done it without ya so you saw a lot of

01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:05,020
code out there for dependency analysis

01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:06,880
and security vote detection sneak is an

01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:09,370
enterprise software composition analysis

01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,490
and security company that has helped us

01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:15,220
build this platform we really appreciate

01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:17,890
it tell us a little bit about what sneak

01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,000
does and how you've been helping sure

01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,770
okay thanks Jim

01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,780
so I think so we're excited to be a part

01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:24,520
of the community bridge and in this

01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,140
initiative now fundamentally I think the

01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,940
reason I'm excited about this is that

01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:31,150
open source you know it's hard it's

01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:32,950
amazing card it's hard from card for

01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:35,320
consumers sort of a new model of

01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:37,000
ownership it's just complicated and I do

01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,830
think a lot of the responsibility on us

01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,840
as foundations as vendors as tool

01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,700
providers is to make it easy to make it

01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,520
easy to do the right thing and simplify

01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:48,070
it so at snake you know if you don't

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,630
know much about us and our our thesis is

01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:51,400
very much been around making security

01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:53,860
easy and specifically making security

01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,380
easy for developers first we try to make

01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,920
it easy by just finding out about

01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,810
vulnerabilities in these open source

01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,780
components so we know we have our own

01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:02,680
system to try to track on the web you

01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,150
know there's a lot of open source

01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,160
activity that doesn't necessarily make

01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:08,290
it into a CV or an organized database

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,700
because again practices are not perfect

01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:11,260
it's try to fish those out to make it

01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,610
easy to just fine and know about all

01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,800
these vulnerabilities in one place and

01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:17,470
then second is around integrating and

01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,810
making this the understanding of which

01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:21,850
components you are using and whether or

01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:24,730
not they are vulnerable easy as part of

01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:27,010
your development process and last but

01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,960
not least we have a lot very much

01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,770
through this mindset of developers right

01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,270
when we talk about all these

01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:33,070
contributors all these great people that

01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:34,990
were pulling into the community these

01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,640
are generally speaking not security

01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:38,110
experts they're not auditors most of

01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,790
them are developers you have to think

01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,980
about what does it make sense you know

01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:44,080
what what tool what does solution does a

01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:46,690
developer want and one for instance key

01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,160
aspect of that is developers job doesn't

01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,690
end with finding issues it ends with

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,340
fixing them so if we give them a

01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:53,980
solution that just gives them an a very

01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:56,410
long list of problems they're not gonna

01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,870
be very happy and so we built a lot of

01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:00,400
these automated mediation components I

01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:02,230
love that all of those are within

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,569
community bridge because you know that

01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:06,549
makes it generally easy

01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:08,319
or for people to do the right thing you

01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,910
know for the maintainer z' for those

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:13,239
creating and contributing to the project

01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:15,519
to understand which components they're

01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:16,809
using fix find those vulnerabilities fix

01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,609
them do the right thing people want to

01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:20,650
write high quality software and for the

01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:22,449
consumers to also notice the right thing

01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,009
understand you know which

01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,929
vulnerabilities are in here and make

01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,939
your decision understand whether whether

01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:30,519
that is a crippling element for you or

01:03:27,939 --> 01:03:32,949
better yet if you can chip in and help

01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:34,349
again move those forward so really

01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:36,849
excited to be a part of this project and

01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:45,249
see it's right thank you thank you a

01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:47,559
time so we also got some help from

01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:49,299
someone who has been prominent in the

01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,349
open-source community for a long time as

01:03:49,299 --> 01:03:53,979
a good friend of mine

01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:57,969
the CEO of hacker one Martyn Miko's is

01:03:53,979 --> 01:04:00,099
here to tell us about how his community

01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:03,249
which is sort of aligned with the

01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:04,869
open-source community is gonna help out

01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:07,929
you know Martin I've talked to leanness

01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:09,880
about how you know as a developer

01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:11,919
sometimes it's super hard to understand

01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,499
the mind of a hacker right because you

01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:15,609
just have to I remember he told me once

01:04:14,499 --> 01:04:18,579
he's like I don't even know what's in

01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:20,619
those folks heads but you're helping us

01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:22,749
by connecting these two communities

01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:23,979
together tell us about the hacker one

01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:26,890
integration what you're doing at hacker

01:04:23,979 --> 01:04:29,679
one we could say that with enough

01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:33,309
hackers every security challenge is

01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:35,049
shallow we've heard that before so some

01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:38,499
things stay the same and some things

01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:41,499
change and this community and we are

01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:44,469
always a place with lots of people who

01:04:41,499 --> 01:04:48,130
disagree on every single detail but

01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:50,319
always agree on collaboration that stays

01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:52,659
the same what's changing now is that

01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,569
every piece of software you develop has

01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:56,859
to be secure and it wasn't like that

01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:58,929
and I know because I was there

01:04:56,859 --> 01:05:01,599
developing all that insecure software

01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:04,359
that's now full of vulnerabilities but

01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,969
now we have assembled at hacker one we

01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:10,179
take us our mission to help you build

01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:13,419
safe and secure software and we have an

01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:15,729
army of three hundred thirty thousand

01:05:13,419 --> 01:05:16,849
ethical hackers who've signed up with

01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:18,769
hacker one

01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:22,279
to hack the hell out of your software

01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:24,589
and tell you what's wrong because you

01:05:22,279 --> 01:05:26,900
will get hacked anyhow and it's better

01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:28,789
to be hacked by these kind people here

01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,680
on the posters those are some of the

01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:32,119
best hackers in the world when they

01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,369
reach a certain level we make a

01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:36,710
dedicated poster so each one of those is

01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:38,690
one particular human being who's a

01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:41,539
brilliant brilliant hacker but we have

01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:45,319
over 300,000 of them that will help you

01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:47,299
and we're just delighted about community

01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:49,910
bridge because now it enables us to

01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:52,460
bring this to everybody in this

01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:54,349
community and allow you to get access to

01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,849
these people even if you feel like you

01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:57,650
don't have the funding you don't have

01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:59,690
the resources you don't have to you

01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:02,239
don't know how to do it we can now do it

01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:04,400
in a way that's easy to get going and

01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,549
that's what's so exciting with all of

01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,920
this thank you hope to find a lot of

01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:12,289
bugs and fix them I really appreciate

01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:18,289
your support Martin and we're happy to

01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:21,769
have you thanks to two more left here so

01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:24,859
I called up what was it a couple months

01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:26,299
ago the CEO of stack share IO how many

01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:29,059
people here have seen stack share I yeah

01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:30,950
it's awesome it's this cool tool you can

01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:32,900
go on see what open source projects

01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:34,759
people are using you can compare the

01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,589
projects and so forth I called up my own

01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:38,150
ass and said we're doing this thing we

01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:39,920
can't figure out what everybody's using

01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:41,690
can you help us out and Yanis was kind

01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:49,130
enough to help us please welcome to the

01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:52,339
stage illness from stack shared alright

01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:54,049
I'm going to well first of all honored

01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:57,109
to be here thank you very much like to

01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:59,210
have you I'm gonna make this very very

01:06:57,109 --> 01:07:05,769
brief and I've got some very simple

01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:09,319
slides here let's start hit it hard

01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:11,509
so for those that aren't familiar stack

01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:14,269
share our mission is to make developers

01:07:11,509 --> 01:07:16,219
more productive by helping them learn

01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:19,069
about Technology through the people and

01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:21,109
companies they trust so the problem is

01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:23,690
there's hundreds of thousands of tools

01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:26,930
out there right there's open source self

01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:29,240
hosted cloud SAS past the listicles

01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,940
right very difficult to choose which

01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,310
technologies you should use we're

01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,560
solving that by allowing developers and

01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:39,320
companies to publicly share which tools

01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:42,410
they're using in their tech stack and as

01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:45,620
all of us in this room know the modern

01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:47,720
tech stack is actually dominated by open

01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,070
source technologies right so more often

01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:52,160
than not you're using open source

01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:55,190
whether you know it or not and so when

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,750
Jim called me up and said hey I've got

01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:59,450
this thing that I think you guys could

01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,580
help with I immediately said yes not

01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,590
only because of you know the fact that

01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,620
it's Linux Foundation and the work they

01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:08,750
do is is important but because this

01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:11,450
specific initiative community bridge is

01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:13,790
actually a very holistic approach and

01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:17,390
it's not sort of this band-aid one-off

01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:21,500
solution right being able to sustainably

01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:22,850
fund security patches while increasing

01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:26,270
the diversity within the open source

01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:28,340
world is actually an amazing way to help

01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:31,880
the entire ecosystem and stack share

01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:35,900
we're honored actually to be a small

01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,300
part of the solution here so why are we

01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,650
here so the the purpose of stack share

01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,690
you know the reason we exist is because

01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:44,360
when you're going to adopt a tool

01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:46,460
particularly open source one of the main

01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:49,220
questions you have to ask is well who

01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,050
else is using it right and right now

01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,660
that's kind of a difficult question to

01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:56,060
answer a lot of projects don't tell you

01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:59,090
who's using the software right which

01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:02,090
companies and who else is using it some

01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:03,890
bigger projects do and that have the

01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:07,520
resources so this is where stack share

01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:10,970
comes in we've actually built the

01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:14,750
world's most comprehensive sort of like

01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:16,460
open source and SAS usage database

01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:19,130
that's crowd-sourced again this is all

01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:22,370
public data and we've brought it all

01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:24,440
together in one platform and the reason

01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:25,970
that this is important is because when

01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,860
you're funding a project this is

01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:30,710
actually one of the things you want to

01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:33,320
know so what you'll see here actually

01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,910
starting today we've we've released sort

01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,440
of new aspect of the platform you can

01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:38,510
not only see what companies like uber

01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,400
are using but you can actually see why

01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:42,530
they chose specific tools

01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,900
in their stack particularly open-source

01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:47,900
tools so here you'll see Connor who may

01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,820
be in the audience from uber actually

01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,500
talking about Jaeger and why they

01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:55,340
decided to build it an open-source and

01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:58,460
under CN CF and so all this data is now

01:09:55,340 --> 01:10:00,950
available through brand new graph QL API

01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:04,280
and point that's a set of M points that

01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:06,200
we opened up specifically for Linux that

01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,330
gives you access to all this information

01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,930
and when you're browsing profiles on

01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:14,270
community bridge you can actually see

01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:16,250
who's using these projects and we see

01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,560
this as the beginning of much deeper

01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:20,960
integration and and larger partnership

01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,880
but again we're really happy to be able

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,100
to help out here and thanks for the

01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,080
opportunity awesome thank you thank you

01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:30,380
all right we're almost somewhere in the

01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:34,220
homestretch last but not least ISO Khan

01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:37,280
he is the CEO of sourced when I first

01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:39,650
got introduced to him he said Jim we

01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,440
have all the code and we've cashed it

01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:44,330
all and we're taking machine learning

01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,630
tools and we're trying to get insight

01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:49,670
into patterns of code there's security

01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:52,040
implications all sorts of stuff I said

01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:53,510
can you help our open source projects

01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:59,180
with those tools he agreed to do it

01:10:53,510 --> 01:11:01,510
welcome prices for this from yeah so

01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:03,890
today I'll be talking a little bit about

01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:06,020
some of the things today we help

01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,250
enterprises around the world wid and how

01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,620
we can start bringing this to open

01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:11,810
source projects well the main emphasis I

01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:14,120
want to make though is already what Jim

01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:16,220
have been talking about is that today as

01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,930
developers we spend a massive amount of

01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:21,260
our time close to a 40 percent of our

01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:23,900
time actually on that code we spent

01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:27,710
hours debugging refactoring fixing

01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:29,870
vulnerabilities and one of the things

01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,910
that have sourced we've introduced today

01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:34,250
to open source communities to

01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:36,140
enterprises to individual developers

01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:39,260
running this on their computer is this

01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:41,180
notion of engineering observability the

01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:42,680
ability that today when we take an

01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,210
enterprise environment I'll talk a

01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,160
little bit later about how this reflects

01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:49,280
in open source communities at the very

01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,620
top level we set behavior through

01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,690
guidelines that can be a technology we

01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,730
choose to adopt or a best practice here

01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:57,560
best practices we're going for and then

01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:59,570
further we go down in the organization

01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,340
we want to start enforcing these

01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:03,739
guidelines we want to make sure that new

01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:05,360
code that gets added actually follows

01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:07,250
these practices and we can fix things

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,810
proactively and at the end of the day

01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,610
when the actual developer is touching

01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,440
the code we want to make sure that we

01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:14,930
can actually prevent and fix you know

01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:17,290
violations this isn't so different today

01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:19,580
from governance in an open-source

01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:21,560
project we're at the top level there you

01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:24,890
have the maintainer and then a

01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,860
widespread of practitioners below but at

01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:29,080
the end of the day when we look at

01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:31,910
projects and we look at code and

01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,010
engineering in our being it comes down

01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:36,469
to three parts it comes down to people

01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,910
it comes down to the actual behavior and

01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:40,880
it comes down to the technology that's

01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:42,320
there and what we see an open-source

01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,050
reflects very much what we see in

01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,730
enterprises it's not common for us to

01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:48,500
work with a bank or a telecommunication

01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:51,680
company and find that you have over

01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:54,080
20,000 projects repositories spread out

01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:57,260
across your organization with dozens of

01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:00,230
years of history and today what we do

01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:02,360
with sourced is we can analyze that

01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:03,830
talent we can analyze who is actually

01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,810
writing that code what skills do they

01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:08,330
have who are collaborating across

01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:09,830
projects we can identify knowledge

01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:11,900
leaders - pretty interesting machine

01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:14,000
learning models that are actually

01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,320
analyzing the core at a source code but

01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,420
we can also take all those guidelines

01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,850
and best practices and turn them into

01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:22,310
code code that later you can then see

01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:25,040
where do we violate it track the impact

01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:28,190
measure it and also prevent violations

01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,050
and while doing this ready Jim talked a

01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,670
little bit about that today both on the

01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:32,660
upstream and the downstream

01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:34,520
understanding what do you actually use

01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:36,260
right what are the languages of

01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,150
frameworks and libraries that you depend

01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,100
on but not just that how does your

01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:42,440
architecture look like what is the

01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,989
impact of changes in your dependencies

01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,520
and actually measuring the change from

01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:50,060
one technology to another often

01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,820
happening in big projects so at source

01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,040
we have two main components we're fully

01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:57,320
open core an open source company what

01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,810
you see here actually is is available on

01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,840
github we run as a fully transparent

01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:05,929
remote organization we are incredibly

01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,340
grateful and depend on and our exists

01:14:05,929 --> 01:14:10,340
today because of the open source

01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:12,650
munity the source engine is what ingests

01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:14,510
all of the source code get version

01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:16,429
control data and other data sources and

01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,349
actually turn source code into a

01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:20,330
universal abstract syntax tree a

01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:23,150
universal language that allows you to do

01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:25,340
complex analysis over what's actually in

01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:27,170
your code base and on the other hand we

01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:29,330
have lookout which at the code review

01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:32,270
level helps you to take those codified

01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:35,150
rules and prevent further actual

01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:37,909
violations and a lot of this is powered

01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:39,409
by machine learning on code about four

01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:41,239
years ago when we started the company we

01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:42,889
decided to create a community for

01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:44,449
researching how machine learning

01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:46,639
techniques can be applied to source code

01:14:44,449 --> 01:14:48,800
analysis at the time we felt quite

01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:50,719
lonely us in a handful of academics

01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,730
today we're very happy to say that

01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,380
that's a massive community where we see

01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:56,510
researchers from almost every computer

01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,369
science university around the world and

01:14:56,510 --> 01:15:00,969
a lot of the companies here in the room

01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:04,639
also actually doing interesting work and

01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:05,690
so what we're announcing today is a lot

01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:07,670
of the things that we've been doing

01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:09,920
today are on the down stream we work

01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,560
inside large enterprises to analyze all

01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,060
of the source code that's there we have

01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,710
a community edition that you can run on

01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:17,690
your computer and analyze at the source

01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,800
code that you locally have but we're

01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,330
going to be starting to do it Linux

01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,820
Foundation is taking all of those

01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:25,909
upstream projects and providing that

01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:29,239
same level of analysis with the source

01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:31,520
engine to those projects and so we're

01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,869
very honored to be part of this we hope

01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,969
that we can start playing a small

01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:37,250
contribution to actually supporting open

01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:38,330
source so thank you very much Jim and

01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:41,060
looking forward to seeing what the

01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:43,790
future brings Singh thanks nice all

01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:45,230
right that was a marathon I appreciate

01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:47,420
you all standing here we still have a

01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:50,389
couple of good speakers but I wouldn't

01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,469
be a very effective person introducing

01:15:50,389 --> 01:15:53,409
something new at the Linux Foundation

01:15:51,469 --> 01:15:56,780
and I didn't if I didn't just give you a

01:15:53,409 --> 01:16:00,730
wait there's more

01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:05,179
so last night as we were outside having

01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:09,260
s'mores on the lawn I got a call from an

01:16:05,179 --> 01:16:11,330
at Freeman the CEO of github and github

01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:14,030
at the very last minute he has decided

01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:15,860
to up the matching grant so instead of

01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:18,409
five hundred thousand dollars we now

01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,110
have six hundred thousand dollars in

01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:21,960
matches

01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:26,550
and so I'm looking at all you I'm

01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:27,900
looking at all of you we got two weeks

01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:30,270
private beta here

01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:32,790
let's go ga with this thing with a

01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:35,250
couple million dollars in funds for

01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:39,570
these projects that need it better

01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:42,720
security more diversity we can do this

01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:45,210
all at the same time funds for these

01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,980
developers this is what we want to do

01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,030
the last thought I'll leave you with and

01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:52,440
then I'm going to introduce our next

01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:54,810
speaker is this is the only the first 5%

01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:57,480
of the functionality that we're going to

01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:59,700
be offering on community bridge we've

01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:03,030
spent a lot of time thinking about how

01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:06,210
we can create tools to make open source

01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:07,740
communities better to provide for easier

01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:09,510
ways for people to on-ramp to

01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:11,880
communities to reduce the ton of

01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:14,730
meantime the bold request response and

01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,560
so on and so forth so throughout the

01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:19,290
year we're gonna be releasing more and

01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,330
we are always looking for Co development

01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:24,240
partners to help us make open source

01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:26,070
better there's no profit motive here

01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,380
we're gonna try and keep these fees at

01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:30,000
zero we want to build out robust

01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,920
functionality to help us all

01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,380
collectively help the open source

01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,240
projects we depend on so I want to thank

01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,370
you all for spending a ton of time

01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,950
listening to me and hope you all

01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:43,200
participate in community bridge with

01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:44,750
that let's give a round of applause for

01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,909
our partners here

01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,909
