	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,460
everybody so my talk is sort of taking

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,679
an economic lens on the general kind of

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,490
concept of commercialization in the

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,360
context of open source software and this

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,630
is something I've been thinking about

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,150
for going going on close to 10 years I

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,100
worked at an early data integration ETL

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,840
software company called Talent how many

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,920
people have heard of town if I can sort

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,710
of see wow that's actually a lot of

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,810
hands about 10 years ago and they were

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,759
one of the sort of very early open core

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,300
companies and so Sid talked about that a

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,270
little bit and the sort of buyer based

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,160
open core model one of the things I like

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,500
to start with since there's very little

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,809
agreement in the industry around

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
terminology is defining commercial open

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,070
source software and so I like to say

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,899
commercial open source software company

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,899
is a company that fundamentally depends

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,789
on a given open source software project

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,039
as the core building block justifying

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,629
the company's existence and so there's a

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,790
tight relationship between the company

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,869
and the project and this is really the

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,369
the crux of the definition there's

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,680
nothing else this is this is business

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,500
model agnostic this is agnostic to the

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,310
type of technology and so on but

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,070
fundamentally defining this kind of

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,640
company I believe was an important sort

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,530
of mental exercise for me since I

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,420
believe if you sort of boil things down

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,950
to the extremes there's exactly two

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,479
types of software companies or

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,100
technology companies that are sort of

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,020
fundamentally software companies there

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,049
are commercial open source software

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,390
companies as defined by this definition

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,860
and there are fundamentally proprietary

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,140
software companies and so we'll kind of

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,390
get into the differences here are some

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,549
examples of commercial open source

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,710
software companies get lab as one and so

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,240
Sid was explaining sort of their journey

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,920
of iterating around their business model

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
there's many other commercial open

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,020
source software companies in the world a

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,299
company behind Drupal Acquia the company

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,549
that supports and scales and manages

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,590
WordPress as a service obviously

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,390
confluent hosts hosts Kafka or the

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,780
creators of Kafka so the sort of

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,989
relationship between the company and the

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,670
project is is very fundamental so if you

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,860
for example if you

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,050
if you removed the company the project

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,489
would continue to exist but if you

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,230
remove the project you know the company

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,530
would no longer would no longer exist

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,700
right so the sort of reason for being

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,830
and the the fundamental existence of the

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,350
company is caused by the existence of

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,300
the core of the core project and these

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,890
are really just a few example companies

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,410
one of the things I've been doing for

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,540
several years five or six years is sort

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,640
of maintaining a spreadsheet of

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,370
successful companies based on commercial

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,319
open source as a model and so commercial

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,480
open source software companies and if we

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,040
look back just five years which is very

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,370
short period of time but a huge amount

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,410
of change has occurred in the industry

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,370
we only had really two companies in the

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,510
industry that were generating

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,489
significant revenue that had large

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,100
scalable businesses based on this

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,150
commercial open source model again

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,470
remember I mentioned this is business

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,470
model agnostic though those two

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,090
companies were Mozilla Corporation and

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,769
Red Hat so Red Hat generates a

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,060
significant amount of revenue based on

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,549
commercializing Linux many other

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,310
projects but mostly Linux and Mozilla

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,350
for the Firefox web browser those two

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,150
businesses had about a hundred million

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,010
in revenue and and an increasing

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,510
obviously Red Hat more but they were

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,170
really the only two significant

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,329
businesses in 2013 at this point we have

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,700
over 40 companies in the world that

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,160
generate over 100 million in revenue at

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,840
a baseline minimum a hundred million in

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,459
revenue and that are defined as

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,640
commercial open source software

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,530
companies this is probably it totally a

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,850
legible snapshot spreadsheet but you can

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,519
go and find this on the internet it's a

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,250
public Google spreadsheet it's regularly

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,500
updated by by contributors and people

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,660
who add comments but I've sort of been

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,720
geeking about this spreadsheet for for

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,630
many years and it sort of represents the

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,180
change we've seen in the license models

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,799
the business models the you know

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,269
projects that might be in a foundation

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,549
like Linux Foundation or Apache or

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,200
others and also sort of looks into the

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,790
relationship between when the project

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
was created and when the company itself

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,750
was also created and founded in some

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,849
cases the projects and companies were

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,640
founded simultaneously other cases the

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,410
project became public before the before

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,300
the company was founded

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,700
cases the project open-source project

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,170
was actually published after the the

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,250
founding of the company and so we kind

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,280
of look at a lot of different dimensions

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,520
here and and and the interesting things

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,490
that I've noticed here are most of the

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,140
large successful businesses have really

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,930
materialized just just obviously over

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,510
the last four five six years and this is

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,360
a really significant shift if you look

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,540
at the value of all these companies it

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,120
sort of is somewhat similar to the value

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,250
of the cloud computing market maybe by a

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,650
factor of two or three but it's actually

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,970
it's somewhat of a younger category if

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,130
you were to categorize it so that the

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,110
total revenue these businesses generate

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,660
just on the top 40 that have 100 million

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,360
in revenue is close to 18 billion

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,310
dollars a year and this is mostly

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,580
software subscription hosted offering

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,480
based revenue and there's 47,000

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,090
commercial open source software

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,700
employees actually full-time employed by

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,860
these companies so companies behind

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,600
projects like Apache like Apache Hadoop

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:33,750
and Magento OpenStack Mule ESB puppet

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,420
Talent Kafka and many others and also

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,470
the venture industry has heavily funded

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,430
these companies but they haven't quite

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,410
appropriated for why these companies are

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,390
fundamentally different this is just

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,010
sort of a graph as I mentioned there

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,440
were only two of these companies in 2013

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,030
now we have 40 the list has grown pretty

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,210
substantially and then the sort of green

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,430
bar indicates the growth of the overall

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,050
of the overall size of the index itself

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,020
so this is just kind of a snapshot of

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,760
the last five six years of data if you'd

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,390
like to see this spreadsheet it's online

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,910
I kind of chose a funny URL it's just

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,190
OSS like open source software a dot cash

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,220
so cash like cash money not cache

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,870
invalidation so I'd like to focus on

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,600
this and then kind of wrap up the talk

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,650
I've been thinking about this quote

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,260
quite a long time and it's sort of my

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,050
mental framing for the diff the

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,220
fundamental differences between

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,390
proprietary software companies or

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,240
fundamentally proprietary software

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,440
companies and and how we define

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,060
commercial open source software

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,020
companies at a fairly reductionist level

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,240
businesses create value

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,400
and then they capture some of the value

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,690
that they create and if you look at the

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,580
column on the Left which is the the

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,590
value creation variable the value

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,370
creation column what we do is we compare

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,840
the inputs into value creation for

00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,540
fundamentally proprietary software

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,530
companies and we compare those inputs to

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,330
commercial open source software

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,030
companies so so so what I tend to think

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,610
of is the the the cause of value

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,200
creation for fundamentally proprietary

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,110
software companies tends to be

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,360
concentrated on three properties that

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,450
have a great impact on that value

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,180
creation variable venture funding

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,130
typically so hiring engineers building

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,680
the product raising more capital to

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,720
distribute the product centralized R&D

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,700
which is you know the engineers and the

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,990
product product people and everyone who

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,060
sort of bringing that product to market

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,160
have to work for that company they're

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,680
employed full-time by that company and

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,310
then thirdly the distribution cost and

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,980
the burden for that is also carried by

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,420
the company if you compare those inputs

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,580
into value creation to commercial open

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,440
source interestingly commercial open

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,990
source has almost the exact opposite

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,460
properties commercial open source

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,160
companies in many cases in order to

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,480
create huge amounts of value

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,120
successful cases like the ones on the

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,030
spreadsheet we looked at oftentimes

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,680
raise 0 capital you know projects like

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,700
like git and Linux and kubernetes and

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,830
Kafka and Hadoop and many others were

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,780
actually either subsidized by large

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,340
internet infrastructure technology

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,350
companies or they were created out of

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,690
academia or they created a side projects

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,100
and hobbyist projects and ultimately

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,220
created huge amounts of value for an

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,740
ecosystem we also see that the R&D

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,310
aspects of these of these companies are

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,360
fundamentally decentralized and the

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,850
distribution costs are actually

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,350
disaggregated across an ecosystem of

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,990
participants and so this is sort of the

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,090
instant free distribution value capture

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,970
I think is where people sort of have

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,970
have a big set of

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,000
kind of fractional perspectives and

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,250
polarization and lack of consensus lack

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,810
of agreement what I tend to sort of look

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,950
at is for value capture with

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,360
fundamentally proprietary software

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,580
companies there's really only two

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,590
constituents capturing value the vendor

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,330
who created the product and the customer

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,030
who pays the vendor to access the

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,300
product in some way with commercial open

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,190
source the big difference here is value

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,770
capture is fundamentally permissionless

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,390
and it's distributed across many

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,370
constituents so you have cloud providers

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,450
capturing value you have hardware

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,920
companies capturing value have

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,530
developers capturing value you have

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,020
government's enterprises and this value

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,510
capture is fragmented in many different

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,430
ways but what I believe is commercial

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,290
open source software creates more value

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,730
than any single constituent can capture

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:36,250
and as a result the best sort of

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,260
business model is one that materializes

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,210
through properties of emergence and

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,130
through iteration much like how Sid

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,680
described to get lab finding their

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,660
business model over time and I just like

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,020
to leave leave you with this thought and

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,550
something that I tend to think about a

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,810
lot and try to encourage other people to

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,050
think about which is that open source

00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,180
software creates vastly more value than

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,100
any single commercial constituent can

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,650
materially capture and I believe that's

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,540
a good thing for a world of abundance

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,780
and innovation and it's and it's a good

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,600
thing for driving technology iteration

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,680
speed and also for end-users communities

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,030
and ecosystems we've seen lots of of

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,800
potentially negative and hostile

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,320
relationships between different

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,170
constituents that capture value around

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,060
open source and I believe we'd be better

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,520
off living in a world where everyone can

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,840
collaborate and partner and

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,910
commercialize in ways that they can

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,050
differentiate with their customers but

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,940
ultimately are better for the community

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,830
in the ecosystem and I think ultimately

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,110
large successful businesses can be built

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,580
as a result so that's that's what I'd

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,870
like to leave you with thank you thank

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,160
you that's awesome no I really

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,170
appreciate it there's not a ton of

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,730
academic research modern academic

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,690
research that hasn't been done like 10

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,340
years ago on value capture on measuring

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,590
economic outputs of open source

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,030
particularly things that are kind of off

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,920
the balance sheet of like an M&A

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,330
transaction or IPs so the work you're

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
doing is awesome and kind of thinking

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,660
about that I think will spur a lot of

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,880
people to go really look deeper so

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,880
