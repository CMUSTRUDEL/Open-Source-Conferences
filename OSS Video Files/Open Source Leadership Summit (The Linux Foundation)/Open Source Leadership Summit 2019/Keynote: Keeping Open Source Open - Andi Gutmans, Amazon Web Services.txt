	Keynote: Keeping Open Source Open - Andi Gutmans, General Manager, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, ElastiCache, Neptune, Amazon Web Services 

At AWS, we focus on solving problems for customers. Over the years, customer usage and dependencies on open source technologies have been steadily increasing; this is why we’ve long been committed to open source, and our pace of contributions to open source projects continues to accelerate. Attend this talk to learn what drives our active participation in open-source communities and how AWS is working to keep open source open.

great hi hi everyone so I'll fill in my

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,600
title it's a bit long so I run a number

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,880
of services at AWS I run a mass on

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,860
elastic search service Amazon

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,349
ElastiCache which is Redis and memcache

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,750
as a service and Amazon Neptune which is

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,600
our new graph database and today I'm

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,070
going to talk about open source oops

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,490
as was mentioned before I've been an

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,340
open source for I think it's over 22

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,820
years started to start to contribute in

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,140
1997 main body of work was around PHP

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,989
but also contributed to lots of

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,050
frameworks development tools probably

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,000
the contribution that I think is kind of

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,219
the the coolest and no one knows is I

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,430
was actually one of the people who wrote

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,530
the tab-completion in the MySQL client

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,480
so if you ever used my my sequel and use

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,390
the command-line client and had this

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,579
Grady awesome command line tab

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,980
completion that happened I think in 1998

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,600
and we were trying to you know test PHP

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,520
with my sequel and it was really

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
frustrating the way to retype the select

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,110
statement every single time and guess

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,920
the table names and that was kind of a

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,720
legacy that no one actually knows our

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,970
and so today I'll talk a bit about you

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,070
know open source at AWS and then I'll

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,869
talk about you know how we think about

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,840
it and how we think about keeping it

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,810
open so first of all very important to

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,960
state we're very very customer obsessed

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,310
company when we innovate and when we do

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,930
work we don't look at our competition we

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,540
don't think of you know what's the

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,340
coolest next technology and we

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,790
definitely don't think of our short-term

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,460
results and we have a saying at Amazon

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,930
we're ready our goal is to build

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,810
relationships with our customers that

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,060
outlast outlast any of us as individuals

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,009
so we were making decisions we're making

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,500
decisions that really are thinking about

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,090
the long term and if you're not thinking

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,969
about the long term benefit for

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,360
customers at Amazon you basically don't

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,040
get to make any decisions and that's

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,110
also how we think about open source and

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,119
our customers really really love open

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,780
source I mean open source is what they

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,190
run on AWS and so a lot of the

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,110
innovation that we're driving an open

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,880
source comes there

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,730
rectly from customer feedback and

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,560
sometimes we innovate by contributing to

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,320
customer projects like net fixes

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,510
spinnaker project sometimes we open

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,610
source our own projects like firecracker

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,230
that we just open sourced and in many

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,110
cases we go and contribute to open

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,790
source that our customers use we also

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,700
use a lot of open source to build a

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,270
platform and you know what we see is we

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,680
see a lot of our internal teams

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,570
sometimes for just selfish reasons not

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,580
wanting to you know maintain technical

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,430
debt they want to make sure that all

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,200
these kit all these all that code goes

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,989
back upstream and we actually have a

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,620
very very easy way for developers in our

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,300
teams to contribute to open source so

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,690
that sometimes a bit of a misnomer about

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,940
Amazon but it's actually quite easy to

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,530
contribute to open source we also care a

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,830
lot a lot about the communities because

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,050
I think community is really what creates

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,630
longevity for open source without

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,030
community open source really is an

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,350
existence and then last but not least

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,360
you know one of the things that I've

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,820
seen in working in open source is co

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,070
quality typically goes up you know it's

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,140
really fast - really easy to fix a

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,790
customer problem in the cloud by using

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,280
the control plane and doing something

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,260
very fast kind of a quick and dirty fix

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,269
but when you have to bring that code

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,299
upstream it's gets reviewed by a lot

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,580
more folks security right there's a lot

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,739
more scrutiny about the security and so

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,480
there's a lot of benefit I think in

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,890
engaging an open source so those are all

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,940
things that are basically driving us

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,100
towards doing more open source and we

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,230
contribute to a lot of different

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,299
projects I basically I had a tag cloud

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,130
up here initially with kind of all the

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,260
projects we contribute to but was a

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,480
pretty ugly slide so I just put picked

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,040
out a few projects you know we're

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,989
contributing to at CD we're contributing

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,170
to java nginx leucine just a bunch of

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:13,840
products out there and contributions

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,840
from Amazon are definitely accelerating

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,040
we put a big focus also keeping

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,560
communities healthy and actually our

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,050
open source team a lot of them are in

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,660
the crowd right now and that team is

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,150
just growing everything

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,950
by quite a lot and the core focus of

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,480
that team is ready to make sure we make

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,090
the investments also in creating and

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,090
keeping the communities open and keeping

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,980
them you know keeping them energetic so

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,660
whether it's Linux Foundation we just

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,230
became a platinum sponsor and Apache

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,060
Software Foundation we support the OSI

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:52,910
we sponsor a lot of conference so ask on

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,460
Cube Khan we're doing a redis con flexed

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,500
month and then we also published a lot

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,320
in social media we have our own twitter

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,590
handle in the open source group we have

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,420
about 20% 20% of the content that we

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,340
create is actually from gasps posters

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,280
from folks from outside of Amazon for

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,920
Biscay you know working with us to

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,210
really make sure we get the open source

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,410
message out I was trying to I was going

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,240
to talk a bit about you know what are

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,400
the different kinds of open source and I

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,980
felt that if I kind of really well you

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,580
know became very accurate we would never

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,110
get out of here so this is a big

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,850
oversimplification of open source but I

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,070
kind of simplified it into four buckets

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,350
you have individual authors which was

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,330
kind of me in 1997 where I thought it

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,240
was really cool to go and work in a

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,030
language and you know worked with a with

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,210
a partner of mine and started to you

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,100
know work on that before the oh the term

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,210
open source was actually not coined at

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,770
the time so we didn't have a thing

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,930
called open source we didn't have a

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,550
thing called get up we just kind of

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,700
started to work on this you know

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,740
source code available stuff enterprise

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,260
driven open source so things like you

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,820
know Netflix projects we just can you

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,070
know we just contributed firecracker

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,080
and then of course foundation owned you

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,710
know things like Kafka kubernetes and

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,780
then you also have the commercial OSS

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,910
vendors which Joseph talked about in the

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,070
value creation there and what's kind of

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,630
interesting is that you know products

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,230
actually move from one to another

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,790
right like Kafka started at LinkedIn you

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,040
know was open source into the patchy

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,930
software foundation and then later on

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,140
also commercial entity was built

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,300
ready started from an individual was

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,950
then sponsored by sponsored by VMware in

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,350
pivotal so it kind of became an

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,190
enterprise driven project

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,140
and then became a commercial german so

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,270
it actually gets very hard to categorize

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,580
open-source projects in any single

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,550
bucket over time because you know

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,470
communities are vibrant and and things

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,390
change I think one thing that you know

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,090
I'm here to talk about is there's been a

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,490
lot of you know I'd say conversation

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,350
from a very few around how open source

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,970
is having issues with kind of the new

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,520
world and how that's kind of making it

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,890
harder for open-source to thrive I think

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,530
it's exactly the opposite I mean I can't

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,630
remember a time where open-source has

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,840
been this vibrant you know when I

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:21,460
started my company on open source back I

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,500
think was in 2000 we went to enterprises

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,410
and we couldn't even talk about our

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,230
product value 80% of the conversation

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,150
was why open-source was okay for them to

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,670
use like they were actually not willing

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,220
to use open source and then another 15%

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,440
was why dynamic languages are okay

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,320
because dynamic languages were basically

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,570
like these toy languages you know no

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,030
strict typing no enterprise application

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,280
uses dynamic languages and I kind of got

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,010
the 5% opportunity to actually try and

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,620
sell something and you know now we're in

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,270
an era where every Enterprise is using

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,970
open-source and they're not just using

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,430
they're contributing open-source right

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,760
service providers are contributing a lot

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,650
and also individuals right individuals

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,690
are basically building their resumes by

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,280
going out to github and starting to you

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,770
know create open source software

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,230
actually most of that opens off to open

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,790
source software we never hear of because

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,730
it's only select few projects that are

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,070
actually going mainstream and even more

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,720
than that I don't think as Joseph you

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,420
know two speakers before me actually

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,670
pointed out we've never been in a time

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,320
where they've been sucked so much you

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,770
know value creation around open source

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,849
also for private companies right for 20

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,190
years we were kind of seeking that

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,190
business model around open source and

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,700
now we're enterprises are adopting open

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:45,280
source in a strategic way and it's

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,470
actually becoming you know companies are

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,620
really really successful at monetizing

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,430
that and not monetizing that because

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,200
they do you know

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,180
make the license changes and so on

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
actually if you look at it most of those

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,080
companies actually got into their high

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,870
growth trajectory in their hockey stick

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,840
by having a very simple and sound

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:10,180
open-source business model so how do we

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,550
think about licensing and you know where

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,160
do we feel at Amazon that you know

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,750
open-source kind of you know needs to

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,540
stay open and what are some of the

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,340
things didn't know we think about you

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,650
know first of all you know from our

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,360
perspective is open source should be

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,660
open source and proprietary software

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,970
should be proprietary and you know open

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,010
source you know open source gets

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,220
traction with the promise of community

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,530
with the promise of openness with the

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,820
promise for the end customer right that

00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,710
they have freedom to use that open

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,960
source however they want and they have

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,780
the choice if they want to make it right

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,610
to self maintain in the long term and so

00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,890
those fundamental freedoms around open

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,080
source I think are very important you

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,540
know when you actually go out and build

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,720
an open source project and get that

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,360
broad traction with the project so you

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,980
know first thing is if you do open

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,110
source you do open source if you do

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,760
proprietor you do proprietary there's

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,800
nothing wrong with a proprietary

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,600
business model you know I have

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,820
proprietary software when I was building

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,710
my company we kept it very clearly

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,380
separate we had an open source project

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,930
and we have proprietary so keeping that

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,430
separate in our opinion is the right

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,220
thing to do if you really want to foster

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,110
a community and make sure that there is

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,320
kind of a long you know you provide

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,670
longevity to open source the second

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,470
thing is you know really making sure

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,040
that when you have you know proprietary

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,260
value add which is a good you know is a

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,300
good model right for many companies and

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,160
it's absolutely something that you know

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,050
has made companies successful you know

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,700
just be very clear with your customers

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,860
you know what they're paying for what is

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,140
open source what they're paying for

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,210
so there's very that so there's great

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,060
clarity for customers and what they're

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,950
getting the third thing is you know one

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,770
of the core freedoms are on open source

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,710
is actually the ability right to view

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,510
the code to change the code to

00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,820
distributor code and as

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,490
they're kind of adheres to whatever the

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,940
license allows you to do you know making

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,950
sure that innovation is enabled from our

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,440
perspective is very very important and

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,420
it's not just about the source code and

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,520
the licensing it's about how the project

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,800
is managed it's about you know a number

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,290
of other things the basically matter

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,260
there and then I would say last but not

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,970
least and when you put open-source out

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,950
there right you're making a certain

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,600
promise like we actually you know back

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,850
in the day of PHP we ran out with a

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,490
certain license and we wanted to add a

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,220
more permissive license and we added

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,410
that instead we didn't take away so

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,500
another thing I think is when you make a

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,710
commitment to a community into users you

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,230
know make sure that you know if you want

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,900
to you know modify your business model

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,880
do it in a way that doesn't change the

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:03,130
rules on the open source in a

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:05,140
retroactive manner so one of the thing

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,510
the most important pieces here is you

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,970
know open sources of supply chain right

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,770
everyone is open is innovating on open

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,710
source and we think about individuals

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,540
and organizations and startups that are

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,530
trying to build awesome products really

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,720
really fast

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,720
right they're basically building on open

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,190
source most of the time and what's cool

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,630
about open source and I think one of the

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,540
things that I've always loved about open

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,190
source is you know you build a product

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,580
right you can get a bunch of pieces

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,700
right from open source right and then

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,030
really focus on your on your value add

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,620
within that ecosystem right and I you

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,360
know taking an example I'll talk about

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,920
some specific pieces in the stacks in

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,020
this deck later on but core supply chain

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,460
pieces that we use today on a day to day

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,070
basis are things like you know

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:59,050
virtualization Linux of course and Java

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,370
right and I'll talk about elasticsearch

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,290
of it later on but if you look at

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,450
elasticsearch right what really made

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,830
elasticsearch elasticsearch its apache

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,920
busine that came from the Apache

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,830
Software Foundation right basically was

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,430
created about 11 years before and is the

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,640
key indexing under elasticsearch also

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,460
using Neddie or Jackson

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,370
log4j and so I think the thing to take

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,410
away from here is you know open source

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,810
feeds open source and I think a lot of

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,400
the innovation we're seeing today you

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,700
know is because there's this great

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,580
virtuous cycle from being able to you

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,700
know build on top of that and then you

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,110
know above that you have ice V is your

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,390
managed service provider II of the

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,510
system integrators you have a whole

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,820
value chain right as was shown in one of

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,410
the previous presentations of folks who

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,300
can kind of get the benefit and it's

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,460
really not a zero-sum game because the

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,820
reality is these market segments are

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,700
super big and no one company can

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,610
actually capture the value not Amazon

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,170
not anyone else you know it's hundreds

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,330
of companies if not thousands that

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:11,070
actually captured the value of these

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:13,770
kind of communities the problem happens

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,220
when you know the supply chain breaks

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,630
down and you know and and that's a

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,830
problem that you know when it happens

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,990
retroactive Lee

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,830
it's a real issue so if you think about

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:28,920
Java right Java came out in 1996 right

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,750
so folks had about 23 years of kind of

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,550
having it pretty you know reasonable

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,730
cadence around Java releases and so on

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,260
and then a few months ago right Oracle

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,230
announced that they were gonna change

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,420
you know some of the Java licensing the

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,100
release cadence frankly I don't even

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,870
myself fully understand it because I

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,280
think no one does I think a lot of

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,510
enterprises right now we're trying to

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,400
figure out what's going on

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,350
but we've basically gone into a six

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,600
month release cycle so the security

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,080
updates that most commercial

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,420
applications get is about six months and

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,870
it's not quite clear I think to a lot of

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,340
organizations right now on whether they

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,380
have to pay or don't have to pay for

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,000
Java license and when they're gonna have

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,920
to pay so frankly I don't even know the

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,480
exact details because I was reading you

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,400
know both the Oracle content and other

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,190
content that was out there I think

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,540
there's still a bit of a wait and see

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,000
but the big problem here is it creates a

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,040
lot of uncertainty right we have 23

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,680
years of applications being built on

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,230
Java uncertainty is never good in the

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,330
supply chain and that's something that

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,930
you know we at Amazon kind of saw that

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,820
was

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,260
going to impact our customers right our

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,790
customers were starting to get worried

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,529
about the Java supply chain that's one

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,810
of the one of the decisions that we made

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,820
is when we see you know kind of the

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,000
supply chain breakdowns you know for our

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,040
customers you know we'll take a serious

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,680
look and if we think that the certain

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,149
things that we can help with and to make

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,040
sure that customers really have

00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,410
unfettered access right to what they

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,589
were used to then we're gonna you know

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,170
basically act and you know try and help

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:07,230
out and that's why we announced that

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,529
Amazon careto a few months ago careto is

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,570
basically a distribution for Java that

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:16,050
is free for everyone you don't have to

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,820
be an Amazon customer and we are

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,550
basically providing that long-term

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,589
support for free so we are going to be

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,430
doing you know back porting security

00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:31,050
fixes I think for Java 8 until June to

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:33,959
2023 for Java 11 - I think August 2024

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,940
and so you know with careto we've

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,209
basically been helping out not only our

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,400
customers by zero overall community to

00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,800
make sure that we take that supply chain

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,709
issue out of the system and we really

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,490
help and make sure that enterprises can

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:52,170
continue to bet on Java very important

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,020
to note that a you know fundamental

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,240
thing for us in creating careto is we

00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,279
didn't want to go in for Java you know

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,520
we think the open JDK project is you

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,260
know great and fine and so you know any

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,510
back porting that we do any work with

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,630
you on Java we actually do contribute

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,670
back upstream to open JDK so you know

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,559
very very important to note you know our

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,290
goal here was not to bifurcate any

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,230
community we're contributing back to the

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:22,319
main open JDK project it's just making

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,910
sure we create this distribution the

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,650
customers can trust and they know

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,900
exactly what they're getting and they're

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,250
getting the support that we think they

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,250
should be getting over the long-term

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,690
another you know kind of breakdown that

00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:40,890
was in the news I would say in the last

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,000
24 hours was elasticsearch and and let

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,070
me just say that I think you know

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,630
elasticsearch is awesome software and

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,490
there's a lot of commercial success

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,150
behind elasticsearch and I think that's

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,039
great and as I said before the market

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,480
segment is super big you know it's in

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,919
the middle of log analytics and machine

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,140
generated data analytics and there's

00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,799
just a huge ecosystem on top of this and

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,419
I think from our perspective lots and

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,080
lots of players in this ecosystem are

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,940
gonna do well so our point of view here

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,799
was really kind of a supply chain you

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,539
you know we have a service called

00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,960
elastic search a lot of our customers

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,020
also run elastic search on ec2 they're

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,130
running elastic search elsewhere and in

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,890
June 2018 confusion started to enter the

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,600
elastic search world when a number of

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,429
changes were basically made to how the

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,860
code base was being managed

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,630
first of all proprietary code started to

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,860
be intermingled with open source code

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,630
and not only was it intermingled it also

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,370
started to become very difficult to

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,440
actually understand what is an open

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,679
source what is in proprietary software

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,440
and that's hard to create a real issue

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,140
code commits started to co-mingle open

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,029
source and proprietary so if you wanted

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,700
to be an open source developer and not

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,260
look at proprietary code it actually has

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,649
become it became more and more difficult

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,510
to do so and you'd have to have some

00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:09,090
kind of cleanser on coconuts that

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,620
basically erases the proprietary code so

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,260
you make sure you actually are only

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,570
looking at open source software so that

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,779
started to become really challenging you

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,049
know from our perspective and also from

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:26,399
our customers perspective in addition

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:28,620
the key distribution point really moved

00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:30,960
to kind of the you know source code

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,730
available proprietary version which

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,100
meant that most folks who came and

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,570
downloaded and I think many of them

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,110
probably thought they were getting open

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,730
source

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,010
you're really getting proprietary

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,149
software and that's where the clarity

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,880
comes in right I'm not saying

00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,639
proprietary software is bad I'm just

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,309
saying that it's

00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:51,159
very very important right to be

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:53,229
extremely clear with your customers and

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,979
with the community what's open source

00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:59,289
what is proprietary and then you know

00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:02,049
another piece of another challenge we

00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:04,659
had was innovation was actually shifting

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,269
you know from open source to proprietary

00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:09,219
we've got lots of customers using it a

00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,950
lot of our customers love open source

00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:13,869
they love the freedom to know that they

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,669
can basically self manage over time if

00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,589
they need to right if they don't want to

00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,899
work with us directly if they want to

00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:21,609
self-manage on-premise they want to have

00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,459
this sure and said they get the freedoms

00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:28,359
that that they're used to from open

00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:31,929
source software and so you know what we

00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:34,899
basically announced yesterday similar to

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:39,639
careto was basically a distribution for

00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:42,759
elasticsearch and that distribution has

00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:45,969
really a few key goals number one just

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,549
make it very easy for customers who care

00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:51,820
not everyone cares but the ones I care

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:54,399
about open source to get a package that

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,070
is guaranteed to be Apache 2 license and

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,049
it's completely open source and they can

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,579
do whatever they want with it and that

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,679
includes running it on competitive

00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:05,529
clouds running it on premises running it

00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,269
under laptops right this is true open

00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,399
source from our perspective it is not

00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:13,570
Amazon open source its community open

00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:15,249
source second as we saw innovation kind

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,519
of slowed down on the open source side

00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:21,009
we felt it was really important to start

00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,899
also innovating on open source and so

00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:28,149
we've added capabilities there such as

00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:29,950
security sequel alerting and you know

00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:32,289
our goal is to continue to innovate an

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,959
open source and give that code you know

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:37,299
back to the community and make sure that

00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:39,700
whoever is interested in this kind of

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:43,149
distribution can get that kind of

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,609
unfettered license distribution and that

00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:48,459
gives them long-term control of their

00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:50,919
environment and then last but not least

00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:52,749
the goal here is to you know build a

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,119
community we've had customers like

00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:57,909
Netflix and Expedia kind of you know

00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,120
join us for me announce this but we've

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:01,629
seen quite a lot of interest

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,539
you know just in the past 24 hours of

00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:07,190
you know other customers and partners

00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:10,179
that are potential interest in this and

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,799
so our goal is to truly build a merit a

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:14,360
meritocracy here about a community

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,090
driven project where it's not only

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,070
Amazon but it's really others we're

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,559
contributing to this project and we're

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,450
making it very easy we've even

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,649
eliminated the requirement for

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,629
contributor License Agreement for a lot

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,820
of the smaller patches it's basically

00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:33,649
click-through approval that they're

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:36,139
contributed under apache2 and you know

00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:38,210
we're going to continue to invest in

00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:39,889
this and make it available and then some

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,990
of those features are going to find

00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:45,440
their way back to our managed service

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:49,100
but of course you know anyone is welcome

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,619
to take this distribution and innovate

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,629
on top of it however they see fit in

00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:59,690
every environment in any environment

00:22:53,629 --> 00:23:03,200
that they want to run it in so you know

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,929
we're we're open for contributions by we

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,909
are partnering a lot right now both in

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:10,279
the CNC F you know around a lot of

00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:12,169
different communities on contributing

00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,330
with partners and even competitors

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,080
around open-source and the same is true

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,990
for here you know we're we're welcoming

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,600
anyone to come and join us you know if

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,649
you're interested in a open distro for

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,970
elastic search you know talk to us and

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:33,309
you know our goal is just to make this a

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,570
good credible project for the community

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:42,460
thank you

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:42,460
