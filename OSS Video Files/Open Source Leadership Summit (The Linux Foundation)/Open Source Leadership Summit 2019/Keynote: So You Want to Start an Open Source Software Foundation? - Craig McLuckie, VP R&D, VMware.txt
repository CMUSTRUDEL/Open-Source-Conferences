Description: 
	Keynote: So You Want to Start an Open Source Software Foundation? - Craig McLuckie, Vice President R&D, VMwareÂ 

CNCF has emerged as a key element in the success of Kubernetes and is a key element of the innovation around the emerging container and cloud-native computing trends. During this session, Craig will look back over the early days of the foundation. The session will cover some of the thinking that went into the design of the foundation and provides perspective on what worked well, and some lesson learned for organizations thinking about following suite. He will share some observations about the likely challenges facing the community moving forwards and what we can do together to ensure the continued health and success of the initiative.

Craig McLuckie
VP R&D, Cloud Native Applications, VMware
Craig was the founder and CEO of Heptio, a startup recently acquired by VMware. Before that he worked at Google where he was a founder of Kubernetes, supported the bootstrapping of the Cloud Native Computing foundation, and was the initial product lead for Google Compute Engine.

and yeah thanks folks so um this

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,429
presentation may be a little too late

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,340
for some of you there were a lot of new

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,990
foundations announced today and what I

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,070
really hope to do is just give you a

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,119
little bit of the backstory behind

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,320
behind the cloud native competing

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,480
foundation give you a framework to think

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,609
about it and then you know welcome the

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,369
new foundation sort of leadership to to

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,779
the broader family and and hopefully

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,980
give you a few things to think about as

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,590
you're kind of growing that foundation

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,870
out so the first question is you know

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,640
why would you want to start an

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,500
open-source software foundation like

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,180
what's the what's the heart of it right

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,219
how many folks in this room have

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,920
actively bootstrapped and open source

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,660
software foundation all right how many

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,230
of you have done that and have been

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,340
inactive for more than a year right now

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,739
you can look at those people and they

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,059
have this thousand-yard stare and they

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,980
have the kind of you know sort of

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,449
twitchiness with them you know there's

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,570
there's a lot of work associated with

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,800
this process and it really is worth you

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,899
know thinking about you know what are

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,670
the mechanics of a foundation what makes

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,430
it really successful there's some things

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,689
that you know it's fantastic for and

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,860
there's some things that you have to

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,330
really think about and some challenge

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,180
you can have to work through and and

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,460
we'll get into that in a second

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,500
so one of things I always like to say is

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,350
all's fair in love and war and open

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,850
source right now one of the sort of

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,140
principal reasons one of the principal

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,939
motivators of initiating an open source

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,890
software foundation taking this

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,950
technology that you've lovingly and

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,990
carefully grown and create a lot of

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,700
stewardship around and sort of donated

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,600
it out is to make sure that this doesn't

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,020
happen to your neighborhood

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,380
right a lot of folks are looking at this

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,390
idea of like you know open source as a

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,090
competitive battleground you know do

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,799
unto them before they do unto us and one

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,689
of the lovely things about you know a

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,320
software foundation is the act of

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:01,259
letting go is something that gets you to

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,630
a point where your fall life's likely to

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,899
encounter that hostile moment right you

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,099
know we had a pretty significant moment

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,890
today that a lot of people are talking

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,750
about in terms of Amazon Elastic and

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,770
who's right and who's wrong at the end

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,000
of the day you know I don't think there

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,680
is

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,320
right and wrong an opensource I think at

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,450
the end of the day it is by its nature a

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,180
sort of an even playing field and as

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,250
long as you are pursuing an open agenda

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,270
the community will follow you the right

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,620
things will happen it's not worth

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,600
getting emotionally spun up around these

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,060
things but there are a set of things

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,670
that you can do upfront to ensure that

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,200
success happens and as we're starting

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,490
you know the cloud native computing

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,770
foundation um one of the things that I

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,990
think was a critical anchor point for us

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,270
is we were very open and transparent

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,070
around our agenda you know like it was

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,970
easy for me as a member of Google my

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,830
gender was really simple

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,260
yeah I was honored one they'd walked

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,610
away with the game I had to disrupt that

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,490
was it right

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,750
we couldn't effectively compete at the

00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,310
layer of an infrastructure as a service

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,770
offering we had to redefine the

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,420
marketplace and as a result of that you

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,910
know we were very open about our agenda

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,110
we just want this thing to succeed and a

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,490
lot of that could kind of baked into

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,780
cloud native computing foundation you

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,540
know you know from the get-go so you

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,620
know we were certainly motivated by the

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,450
acceptance the growth and the community

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,540
around this technology rather than a

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,830
specific commercial outcome now one of

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,660
the things that you will turn to soon

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,250
discover so we put together this

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,030
open-source software foundation and I

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,440
think we had initially 28 members and at

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,730
the other end of the spectrum like today

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,380
I think we've grown to something like

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,640
three hundred and seventy five minutes

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,430
it's just spectacular outcome for

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,800
everyone the early days of foundation

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,390
forming are perhaps the most political

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,100
things you'll ever encounter right like

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,500
I've done a lot of you know stupid

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,130
things that people advised me against

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,269
that ultimately worked out okay this was

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,380
certainly one of the most kind of

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,880
interesting and challenging I remember

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,430
sitting down with my boss Brian Stevens

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,170
he's like an old hand in the in the open

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,630
source world he was like you want to do

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,620
a foundation good luck right it's like I

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,940
mean how that works out

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,380
you had this little smile on his face I

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,940
was like oh I can't be that hard like

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,920
you know you know what you know how

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,959
challenging it can get it be and

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,290
certainly as you start trying to

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,390
navigate the the sort of early ideation

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,070
process it's one thing to get to a point

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,330
where you have a small number of members

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,709
it's another to get to a point where you

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,169
have you know twenty eight you know

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,169
large names you know actively providing

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:26,300
you know support for a specific outcome

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,350
and one of the key things are council

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,380
people to do is you

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,300
again transparency really matters you

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,110
have to wear your agenda on your sleeve

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,490
right at the end of the day if you come

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,480
into this and think you're gonna you

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,880
know checkmate

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,790
your opponents that are part of this

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,180
foundation in 15 moves you're just

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,950
thinking about the problem the wrong way

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,230
the process of getting to a point where

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,810
you have a gelled foundation you have a

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,030
set of organizations that are putting in

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,160
the same direction has to be grounded in

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,240
some basis of trust and I think one of

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,380
the things that I've really liked about

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,970
the kubernetes community and I've

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,460
certainly liked about the the CNC

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,470
foundation is there has been an ethos of

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,620
you know being pretty upfront with your

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,120
agenda in a red hat is a singularity in

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,190
the open source world they've done an

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,290
amazing job of commercializing open

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,430
source it was always obvious to us what

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,540
their agenda was and they were very open

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,950
with that you know Google had a

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,970
different agenda Microsoft had a

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,060
different agenda you know as this

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,680
foundation grew everyone obviously had

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,480
this perspective but I think everyone

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,500
was very open about that and so as

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,580
you're starting to think about you know

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,330
bootstrapping of foundations is

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,460
something to think about

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,260
now another truism you know an open

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,000
source everyone talks about this you

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,490
know open source is free right for you

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,670
like puppy or free like peer turns out

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,260
it's you know free like puppy now an

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,940
open source software foundation if

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,220
you're looking at it as something that

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,980
is just gonna give you this sort of you

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,530
know free get out of jail free card to

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,050
avoid negative outcomes on the back end

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,620
there they're selling something and it's

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,880
gonna be a lot more painful than a puppy

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,260
chewing a hole in your wall right like

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,540
this there's a lot of work associated

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,950
with this process so it really behooves

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,990
you to think through you know a lot of

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,150
these mechanics and you know one of the

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,620
things that you know folks don't don't

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,940
tend to realize there's there's a lot of

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,710
choices you can make in the early days

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,530
of starting a software foundation there

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,440
is an inordinate amount of work when you

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,160
start looking at the mechanics of

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,260
communications we started thinking about

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,840
the mechanics of legal and all of the

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,410
work associated with you know how do we

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,690
get our you know what is our IP policy

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,160
what license do we accept and not accept

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,190
you know how do we deal with the

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,900
mechanics of events how do we manage and

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,580
maintain a budget how do we deal with

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,950
all these things it becomes

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,180
prohibitively difficult so for the folks

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,949
that recently joined the

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,690
foundation family I mean I think you

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,990
made the right choice if you're gonna do

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,880
it

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,460
hire a pro it's you know the outcome

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,470
otherwise it's gonna feel a lot like

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,789
what happens when you decide hey like

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,169
how hard can Roofing me I'm just gonna

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,539
like replace the roof on my house right

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,600
it's gonna that's a that's gonna like

00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,699
lead you to some strange places and some

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,710
very sad outcomes so one of the things

00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,210
that I think you know and I've certainly

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,250
appreciated you know through the journey

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,919
has been the sort of consistent support

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,530
of a professional organization that

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,330
knows how to do this right I'm not

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,620
saying go and you know just start

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,030
another Linux Foundation Foundation I'm

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,740
not saying that at all what I'm saying

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,720
is I you be a fool to do this by

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,199
yourself may hire a pro if you want to

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,360
start something like this now stepping

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,979
back a little bit and you know this is

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,330
not a Linux Foundation commercial right

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,800
like you know I certainly appreciate the

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,710
work that Linux Foundation did this is

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,620
certainly not a CN CF foundation you

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,210
know commercial what I do want to do is

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,710
point to some of the things that we did

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,820
well and then I'll talk a little bit

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,259
about some of the things that you know

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,050
are still opportunities for us to to

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,780
succeed as we were bootstrapping the

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,159
cloud native computing foundation and

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,690
one of the things that you know I was

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,070
certainly a student of was you know

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,780
other foundations like what works well

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,300
what doesn't like what leads to bad

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,789
outcomes what leads to these situations

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,010
where you get balkanization you get a

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,570
lot of negative forces and one of the

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,830
things that we worked hard to do when we

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,330
were in Stan Shi ating this foundation

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,669
was established this idea of checks and

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,870
balances so ironically I'm a South

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,180
African and I was going through my

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,340
citizenship studies at the time so I was

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,659
learning how do what is the prison live

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,430
he was in the White House like you know

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,680
those kind of questions but one of the

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,690
things that certainly inspired me is we

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,310
were at a point where we had one or two

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,720
choices when you start thinking about a

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,780
foundation as I sort of governance

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,110
framework obviously the most efficient

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,490
you know governance structure is it's a

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,849
benevolent dictatorship right it really

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,740
is we would not be able to find a

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,120
lineage Torvill the kubernetes community

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,820
would never have accepted our most

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,349
horrible and so what we had to do was

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,089
think through other mechanisms of doing

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,320
this and you know one of the most you

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,810
know sort of durable governance

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,110
structures that's existed to date has

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,660
been the US Constitution right checks

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,980
and balances you know you have these

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,660
these three divisions

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,720
each are empowered to do a certain set

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,220
of things and at the end of the day are

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,690
watching each other and making sure that

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,570
things are balanced out and so we we

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,610
tried to take a lot of inspiration from

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,839
you know this type of model as we were

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,430
bootstrapping the cognitive computing

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,470
foundation and you know that really

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,930
resulted in these three distinct

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,820
functions that we stood up one was

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,529
obviously the governance board you know

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,839
this is the organization that has the

00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:24,560
Box you know they get to decide where it

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:29,180
gets spent the second group that we

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,800
stood up was the technical Oversight

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,180
Committee so the idea here was that

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
there would be an organization that

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,730
would ultimately be the tastemakers you

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,649
know for the company you think of them

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,570
as a Supreme Court they would look at a

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,070
given piece of technology and decide

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,230
like is this a good fit it is not a good

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,029
fit they would provide opinion and weigh

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,740
in on a lot of decisions and I think

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,420
those two functions have you know

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,029
succeeded the third piece that we really

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,029
wanted to institute in the foundation

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,709
space was an end user community right

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,300
and so this is something that is is

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,949
growing we have you know good

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,440
representation there but like how many

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:05,690
of you work for a company that's not a

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,680
technology company I mean I guess

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,089
everything every come is a technology

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,050
company how many of you work for

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:15,190
companies that don't sell software right

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,190
so we still got some work to do

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,420
so as you start thinking about these

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,190
things it's it's fascinating you know

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,230
how the dynamics go you know as you're

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,670
bootstrapping a software foundation you

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,649
go through this intellectual exercise of

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,639
trying to like you know picture like you

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,899
know this is gonna happen and this is

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,500
gonna happen and these are the set of

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,819
outcomes the reality is that you know

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,850
I'm a kind of a systems engineering geek

00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:39,829
like at every point of a system scaling

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,630
you can encounter new issues there's no

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,970
practical way to think through through

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,279
all of those things and so you know

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,800
again this sort of loops back around to

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,750
the need for an empowered you know

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,430
Constitution to underpin it you know you

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,380
can't foresee every you know potential

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,540
outcome you can't think through every

00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,170
possible future at the end of the day

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,519
whatever you write into the into that

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,100
sort of Constitution initiating

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,960
documentation is going to have to be

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,700
subject to restructuring growth etc

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,200
and the heart of it is you have to be

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,610
willing to let go right this is that

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,460
this is one thing I'd ask you to leave

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,290
with as you're thinking about should I

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,610
take my technology to a Software

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,120
Foundation should I be thinking about

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,610
this you know there are some amazing

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,780
value propositions associated with that

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,740
there are some amazing outcomes that you

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,570
can generate if you get a

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,700
well-structured foundation like the CNC

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,220
F behind that technology it becomes a

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,390
point of singularity in the ecosystem

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,580
you know all kinds of commercial success

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,290
can emerge around that and it becomes a

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,760
counterbalance to a lot of the sort of

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,290
vendor interest that can ultimately lead

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,180
to balkanization and some of the

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,280
challenges but you also have to accept

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,780
that it's not it's a leap of faith like

00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,770
there's no stepping back from that and

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,530
so just you know think that through a

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,760
little bit as you go and the other thing

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,500
is and this is a sort of you know

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,780
something that I really want to kind of

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,450
challenge all of us to think about when

00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,430
we think about the relationship between

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,630
you know every open source community as

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,880
represented here and the end consumer

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,460
it's largely driven through a vendor

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,110
vector right you know every vendor is

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,460
looking at a subset of the end-user

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,780
community so someone might be looking at

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,800
the the three eggs on the left and

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,070
someone else may be looking at the four

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,450
eggs on the right and they're gonna work

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,190
within the community structure that

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,670
you've created to serve the interests of

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,560
those discrete entities for us to really

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,780
succeed and take this to the next level

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,300
to start generating even more you know

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,350
value through these these types of

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,050
outcomes and these sort of you know

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,310
singularity moments we need to find ways

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,080
to bring our customers close to these

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,670
communities as well I think it creates

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,630
some very natural dynamics you know I've

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,040
had a lot of conversations with

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,780
customers I've had a lot of

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,180
conversations with you know the like the

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,550
the CNC F T or C I've had a lot of

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,720
conversations with the governing board

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,450
you know bringing that together in a

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
structured way you know creating an

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:56,310
obvious open source

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,040
you know platform for the customers

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,410
voice because if the sole point of

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,630
access to the community is through the

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,220
vendors you're going to ultimately

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,270
encounter a lot of these sort of you

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,830
know common friction points so I'd

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,650
encourage everyone who's think about

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,330
starting self accommodation like one if

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,820
you don't have to don't I get us a lot

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,280
of work to if you're gonna hire a pro

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,870
don't do it by yourself and then three

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,340
is you know really think through those

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,410
structures that will enable

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,140
not just the vendors to benefit from the

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,790
technology but finding ways to you bring

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,779
in the end consumers the technology and

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,480
make them a natural part of your

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:34,529
foundation ok well thank you thank you

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,400
thank you

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,720
um CN CF success has been truly has been

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,220
a minute I'll give Dan a hard time about

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,470
it but you know 375 members today

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,140
massive economy around this ecosystem

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,080
the thing that I think you've brought to

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,240
the table in terms of governance though

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,670
my interactions with the TOC that

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,520
tastemaker role at times are some

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,310
friction I'm going to just admit but it

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,440
seems to be working like the the people

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,290
who are in those roles even after

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,080
there's going to change over our

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,700
incredible good taste and I think are

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,930
bringing a real cohesion from an

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,970
architecture point of view to the
