	Keynote: Open Services Cloud: A New Open Model - Bryan Che, Chief Strategy Officer, Huawei

There are many challenges and limitations for open source, IT industry vendors, and for enterprises in today’s public clouds. Even as cloud computing becomes the predominant IT platform, many of the traditional software and open source models of the past 20 years no longer apply well in a world of cloud services. And, newer approaches such as turning software into SaaS offerings on top of public clouds are not enough to address fundamental customer and ecosystem needs.

This session presents Open Services Cloud, a new open approach for cloud computing to address these challenges, and a new initiative with Linux Foundation to drive this into the industry.

good morning it's great to see all of

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,359
you here and as Jim mentioned I did

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,280
spend 15 years at Red Hat before in

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,440
their very early days and so when Jim

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,269
was going through a lot of those s1

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,820
filings and a lot of the concerns I

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,049
remember those days very very well I'm

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,690
actually also going to start with a

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:24,000
little bit of a history from back in

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,400
those days the CEO of red hat at the

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,250
time was a guy named Bob Young he was

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,840
one of the two cofounders of the company

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,579
and back then he used to have this very

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,610
very famous quote an analogy to

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,440
introduce the concept of open source

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,969
into enterprises and to different

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,559
customers to explain why in the world

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,300
should you start to care about this

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,460
thing called open source and the way

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,649
that he would describe it is you know

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,460
would you be willing to buy a car with a

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,260
hood welded shut

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,390
and this was an analogy that really

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,920
stuck with a lot of people and really

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,480
help them understand you know why is it

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,730
important to be able to look inside your

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,710
software we have to make changes because

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,600
just as you would not buy a automobile

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,550
without the ability to service your

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,719
engine or to be able to make changes or

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,580
to understand what was going on

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,140
similarly you wouldn't want to have the

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,930
same effect how when you went ahead and

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,960
acquired software but there's one thing

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,570
that the sort of assumed which is that

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,970
when you go ahead and use software or

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,310
open source for that matter you would be

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,650
acquiring software in order to own it

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,110
and in order to possess it and that's

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,350
dynamic has changed a little bit no over

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,000
the last few years so we've had the rise

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,400
of cloud computing you know over the

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,159
last you know 10 plus years or so and I

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,270
think the question starts to change

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,250
regarding what is the value of open

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,900
source in a cloud world because when you

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,790
take a look at you know the question now

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,950
it really becomes something like you

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,979
know would you order an uber or a DD car

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,810
with the hood welded shut and we've

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,390
moved from an ownership model into a

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,070
renting as a service model and now as we

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,549
start to shift into this kind of dynamic

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,229
a lot of people start to care still but

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,329
a lot of people don't really care what's

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,740
going on in the car anymore because they

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,960
don't own it they don't buy it they just

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,729
use it as a service so we still have a

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,350
lot of projects like kubernetes and

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,690
OpenStack where people can look inside

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,790
the cloud but they're starting to care

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,709
less and less from an enterprise and

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,390
from a customer standpoint in terms

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,530
what's actually happening inside the

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,090
cloud itself and then now more recently

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,530
you know with the rise of clouds and all

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,329
the different services that you have

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,000
around artificial intelligence and

00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:29,189
gaming and databases and so on now this

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,650
is really like asking would you order a

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,389
self-driving personalized entertainment

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,030
providing turbo boosting you know

00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,189
automobile with the hood welded shut

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,379
and I think at this point in time very

00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,030
very few people care at all in terms of

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,620
what is going on inside your cloud

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,290
because you're just consuming all these

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,329
very very rich services and whether it's

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,220
built on top of open-source or whether

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,200
it's built on something else it doesn't

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,389
matter so much to the end user they just

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,209
want to consume these rich services from

00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,090
a cloud standpoint and so I think we

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,889
start need to take a look at what is the

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,599
value of open source in a cloud world

00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:06,689
and what are the new kinds of questions

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,329
that become important to ask in this new

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,069
industry so the key question is no

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,450
longer know would you buy a car with the

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,909
hood will that shut or would you order

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,430
an uber with the car would it welded

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,139
shut but you we have to start asking no

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,090
do you want to live in a world where

00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,340
only uber and didi can offer you

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,169
transportation services and that's the

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,909
new open/close question that we need to

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,180
start thinking about from an overall

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,040
industry standpoint together and just to

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,290
make that very explicit no do we want to

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,419
live in a world where there only fewer

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,430
than no ten clouds around the world that

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,409
can offer all the digital services that

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,970
we want to consume it's a big challenge

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,829
for our industry there's obviously been

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,139
a lot of conversations you know in the

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,459
press and social media and others around

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,379
this but I think this is the key

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,449
question that we need to start engaging

00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,069
with from a cloud services world and

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,750
what do we do from an open-source

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,689
standpoint and what do we do from an

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,489
industry standpoint now let me dive into

00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,530
this a little bit just to talk a little

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,689
bit what are the actual challenges that

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,250
we face from an industry in terms of

00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,870
coming together to be able to build a

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,609
lot of these cloud capabilities and

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,109
there's really two kinds of challenges

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,639
that I think we need to address

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,530
now the first kind of challenge that we

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,380
need to start to address is something

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,000
that you can think of as lock out you

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,830
know people often think about lock-in

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,840
when they talk about cloud as a problem

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,480
but I think lockout is an actually

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,190
bigger problem and the ecosystem

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,350
our trip providers and software

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,540
providers are fundamentally locked out

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,840
of being able to create native managed

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,820
services inside of public clouds so just

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,620
as an example you know if you go into

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,470
any public cloud around the world today

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,240
they'll typically offer you a software

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,740
image marketplace this is where you go

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,450
ahead and you buy all the third-party

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,220
software that you want so I've just got

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,630
a few examples up here from you know

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,420
some of the people in this room like

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,180
MongoDB or Red Hat OpenShift or sa P

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,250
know and so on but basically if you want

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,230
to go ahead and use their software in

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,610
the cloud you run it on top of a virtual

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,980
machine service you buy the machine

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,200
image you deploy it so you can here

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,420
click to deploy view the deployment

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,210
guide you know launch the machine image

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,760
basically your IT operations team has to

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,470
go ahead download it configure it manage

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,750
it operate it and take overall

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,360
responsibility for the lifecycle of that

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,340
software on the other hand you can also

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,200
go into all the different public clouds

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,720
around the world and you can consume

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,880
that exact same capability as a managed

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,640
service from the providers themselves

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,230
and so the big challenge for a lot of

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,450
the software vendors is that they don't

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,850
have the capability to create these

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,590
managed native services inside the

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,870
public cloud because they're locked out

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,070
and restricted into these various kinds

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,270
of offerings so when you an IT

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,890
Enterprise you know customer are taking

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,810
a look at well how do I want to go ahead

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,760
and consume capabilities from the cloud

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,160
I can choose between taking ownership

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,190
but there's a huge operational cost and

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,770
expense and hassle or I just consume the

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,270
same capability as a service and so the

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,670
cloud providers have an incumbent

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,830
advantage in terms of how do we go ahead

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,140
and start to give these capabilities to

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,970
our customers in a much better in a much

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,070
simpler way and so the ecosystem was

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,110
fundamentally locked out from being able

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,120
to do the same things and offer the same

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,440
technical capabilities that the cloud

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,060
providers themselves were able to offer

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,190
now what a lot of software providers are

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,230
then doing is saying that ok we know

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,670
that our customers don't want to be in

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,740
the business of operating and managing

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,720
the software ourselves so we'll go ahead

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,700
and build a software as a service on top

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,470
of these public clouds and a lot of

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,840
these same companies are building out

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,830
these SAS applications that run on top

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,750
of the public cloud

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,669
and so again here just four different

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,210
examples across the open-source spectrum

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:51,030
with s AP and red hat and MongoDB and no

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,129
confluent and so on now the challenge

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,440
with a SAS application is it still

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,629
doesn't fundamentally solve this lockout

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,599
problem every single one of these four

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:03,180
Sasa's runs across the same public cloud

00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,759
but if i'm an enterprise building an

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,470
application across these four sasses i'm

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,270
going to have a lot of challenges in

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,009
terms of how do I incorporate all these

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,289
force assets into the same enterprise

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,449
application even though they share the

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,949
same infrastructure because these forces

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,110
are going to have different billing

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,819
systems different identity systems

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,460
different networking spaces different

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,840
storage systems and so on and so if I

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,030
want to compose an enterprise

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,430
architecture across all these four

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,039
Sasa's it's a lot more complicated than

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,719
if I use the direct native services that

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,280
offer the same capabilities on the

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,379
public cloud because they share the same

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,479
service engines and they don't have any

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,849
of these same limitations that SAS

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,250
applications have and so the ecosystem

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,860
is fundamentally locked out I can either

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,560
build an image in a marketplace or I can

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,539
build a SAS application both approaches

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,430
are severely limited compared to what

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:58,080
the native services and the public

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,819
clouds themselves can offer the other

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,120
half of the problem that we have to take

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,580
a look at is lock-in so a lot of

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,979
enterprises are going after a multi

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,000
cloud strategy today and so that means

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,680
that they want to be able to run

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,810
workloads across multiple different

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,990
public clouds and one of the challenges

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,190
for going multi cloud today is that

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,960
enterprises as they go multi cloud they

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,060
fear lock-in and a lot of them start

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,699
adopting this least common denominator

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,860
approach so what I've shown here are

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,870
just some of the compute services across

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,050
three different public clouds in this

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,520
case AWS Azure and huawei cloud and you

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,620
can see that you know even though they

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,449
all have a lot of different rich compute

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,909
services they only have two sets in

00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:41,339
common virtual machines and kubernetes

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,169
so that means that if I want to start to

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,089
take advantage of a lot of these richer

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,370
capabilities in the public cloud I

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,959
fundamentally tie myself into that one

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,270
public cloud and make it more difficult

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,670
to adopt other public clouds

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,580
conversely if I want to go multi cloud

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,680
and adopt me

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,050
common denominator I have to worry about

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,970
am I getting the full utilization of my

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,920
public cloud capabilities and as my

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,720
competitor going to start using a lot of

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,610
these capabilities that I'm withholding

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,830
from myself because I've decided to go

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,570
multi cloud and so there's no service

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,670
portability across these different

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,620
public cloud architectures and so

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,570
customers are forced to choose no

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,470
between two different bad options that

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,360
they don't really like and when we take

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,040
a look at lock-in know we're all here to

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,410
talk about open source and open source

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,570
is a wonderful thing and I'm a big big

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,640
believer in open source but service

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,110
lock-in is not a problem that open

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,890
source by itself can fundamentally

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,079
address just to illustrate this on the

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,089
left-hand side you can see you know from

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:41,980
a traditional software development model

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,959
you know how we go from code creation

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,550
all the way to commercial products and

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,970
so if we take Linux you know we're here

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,740
at the Linux Foundation conference we've

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,480
got these developers who write in the

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,250
upstream community then we get these

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,560
community distributions you know like a

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,510
bun to and fedora and Debian and so on

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,430
and these are the places where everyone

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,810
in the community has access to the

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,910
software capabilities to do with

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,980
whatever they want and wherever they

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,600
want and then downstream from that we

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,250
have a lot of these commercial products

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,420
where people can go ahead and buy it

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,890
when they need you know different

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,649
capabilities like support or

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,839
certification and so on when we move to

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,180
the cloud services world we don't have

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,130
that same dynamic we go straight from no

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,709
a really popular open source project

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,079
like kubernetes and the first time that

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,790
you can consume it as a service in a

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,829
cloud is when one of the commercial

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,050
providers decides to unable and so you

00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,610
access to that and they only deliver it

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,240
to you the way that they have built it

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,520
out so this whole community access

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,170
capability around services is absent you

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,910
know no matter what you do in open

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,740
source it doesn't address the

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,220
distribution and availability of

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,420
services from a public cloud standpoint

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,949
so these are the two sides of the

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,630
challenges that we need to start to

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,670
think about know if we want to address a

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,800
lot of these challenges people have been

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,899
thinking about in terms of how do we

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,240
deal with open and how to deal with open

00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,070
source in a public cloud world on the

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,140
one hand you're dealing with lock out

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,990
because you know enterprises and

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,910
customers are not able to bring in

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,410
and build the same kinds of capabilities

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,959
that the service providers themselves

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,910
can on the other side we have to deal

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,160
with lock-in because you don't have

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,029
service Portability and open source is

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,890
not enough to give you what you need so

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,080
this is why I think that we need a new

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,060
approach around how do we do open in

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,430
public cloud and I'm calling this open

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,740
services cloud and this is in contrast

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,600
to open source software because I think

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,300
what we need to do is to fundamentally

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,100
open up the service layer inside public

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,950
clouds so that we can start to build out

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,709
this services ecosystem in an open and

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,450
in a community way so there's three

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,370
things that I want to highlight across

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,950
what we're hoping to do from an open

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,420
services cloud standpoint the first

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,190
thing if you look at the left-hand side

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,399
is we need to address this lockout

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,950
problem now over here I've shown just a

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,200
high-level diagram inside the huawei

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,380
public cloud for how do we actually

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,540
build manage services in our cloud so in

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,160
the yellow this could be any public

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,350
cloud service so for example our

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,970
artificial intelligence services or a

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,700
database services or a container

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,620
services and so on and in the blue or

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,450
all the enabling services that are

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,640
internal to quality cloud for how do we

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,620
take software and turn it into a native

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,810
managed service inside the public cloud

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,180
so these are things like how do I do

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,070
billing how do i do identity management

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,020
how do i do console access how do i do

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,360
deployment how do i put it into the

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,010
service catalog and so on and these are

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,110
all private in our own cloud at

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,459
following these are private across every

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,440
single public cloud in the world right

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,810
now but one of the things that we are

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,510
now working on is we are going to open

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,420
up third-party equal multi tenant access

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,339
to these api's so that anyone will be

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,990
able to come in to the public cloud and

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,270
have the ability to create a native

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,160
managed service in the public cloud no

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,620
different from what the cloud provider

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,329
themselves can create so this is solving

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,120
the lockout problem we will open up

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,130
access into all the capabilities inside

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,339
a public cloud so that if you want to

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,649
build a software as a service model that

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:13,690
is truly native and no different from

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,700
any other public cloud service you will

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,560
for the first time have access to these

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,050
kinds of capabilities in the public

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,680
cloud that's dealing with the lockout

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,480
challenge

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,900
the other challenge we have to deal with

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,790
is lock-in because we don't want this to

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,040
be you know just a single public cloud

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,480
solution and we also know that for all

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
the software vendors that are out there

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,720
you don't want to be in the business of

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,060
writing to a whole bunch of different

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,820
public cloud know native service engines

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,770
so we are also working to create an

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,930
open-source framework what this

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,300
framework will do is that it will sit on

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,520
top of all the different service engines

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,340
so that as different public clouds make

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,190
available access to the internal service

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,810
engine api's we can broker across that

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,970
and provide a single open-source

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,120
framework that enterprises can write

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,460
across so now if I'm a software vendor I

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,920
write my software application to that

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,380
framework once and I can deploy that as

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,010
a native service across different public

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,900
clouds so we achieve achieve true multi

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,640
cloud service portability for the first

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,410
time in the industry and this is where

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,390
we solve a lot of that lock-in problem

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm not afraid of going into different

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,100
public clouds because the services are

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,650
actually portable at the service level

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,920
across different public clouds so that's

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,570
how we address the lock-in challenge and

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,310
finally how how do we make sure that

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,960
this is an industry initiative and

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,700
something that we can build together in

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,380
the community this is where we're

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,600
working very closely with the Linux

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,550
Foundation to be able to create a new

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,490
foundation around the open services

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,620
cloud and also a lot of this open source

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,660
work to drive everyone coming together

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,880
to build this from an overall industry

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,310
standpoint so this is what we're looking

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,710
to do as part of open services cloud we

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,360
need a new model in terms of how do we

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,430
start to address these challenges of

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,770
open source software access and adoption

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,210
in the public cloud and also for open

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,730
source itself how do we start to make

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,680
that much more valuable and usable in a

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,540
public cloud and this is the way that we

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,460
can start to put the open source

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,440
community in control of how do you

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,480
actually deliver end-to-end services

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,610
versus just being the building blocks

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,540
that somebody else takes to be able to

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,060
power their commercial clouds now as

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,880
part of this dynamic what we're looking

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,940
to do is to evolve the public cloud from

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,330
a model today where it's really a closed

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,830
form into being a truly open market so

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,930
if you look at you know public clouds

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,180
today you know they're really split

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,950
between the marketplaces that they offer

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,630
as well as their own native service

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,480
catalog if you go into the marketplaces

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,700
you can consume a software image or a

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,620
SAS application as I highlighted before

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,810
but if you look at the service catalogs

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,190
for the providers themselves know this

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,830
is where they offer all their good

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,900
native managed services and our open

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,540
services cloud model what we can do is

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,180
we can unify so that everything becomes

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,400
a cloud service from third party war

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,470
from first party and everything becomes

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,200
a unified catalog of cloud services

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,910
across the provider we also change the

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,370
dynamic in terms of how we work with the

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,470
ecosystem and with their customers so

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,660
today no software vendors hardware

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,360
vendors were largely locked out from

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,370
public clouds but in the future we can

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,710
all become partners in terms of how do

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,210
we build services together from a public

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,130
cloud so it's no longer just you know

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,200
the provider themselves that are able to

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,570
build services together but everyone can

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,790
do it in the community and customers are

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,530
not locked in because the services are

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,350
only proprietary to that one cloud

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,150
provider but we can achieve true multi

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,580
cloud service portability and so that

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,680
opens up the ability to for customers to

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,140
be able to deploy multi cloud and hybrid

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,790
cloud wherever they want and this is

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,710
also fundamentally shifting the value

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,680
summary of what we do from a public

00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,450
cloud standpoint so today no public

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,880
cloud is really the place that I go to

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,449
in order to get that cloud providers

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,510
know owned services in open services

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,220
cloud we can flip that to say cloud

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,660
should be where I get everything as a

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,150
service it doesn't matter who the

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,520
provider is the value of cloud is that

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,589
I've shifted over to this service model

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,870
and I want to consume everything as a

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,060
service I don't care so much about who

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,130
is the vendor behind that service I just

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:32,430
want to build my business in the best

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:34,620
way possible so another analogy just to

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,380
sort of explain this you know if you

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,830
remember back in 2007 when the iPhone

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,220
first launched there was no app store at

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:46,410
the time and this is an actual Apple

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,030
advertisement from back in 2007 where

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,060
they said that if you want to be able to

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,160
build applications and run third-party

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,050
workloads on your smartphone the way to

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,600
do that is through web apps and

00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,640
multi-touch so remember third-party

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,890
applications you could only build a web

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,250
application and access it in mobile

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,290
safari but if you wanted to get the true

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,650
native experience on the iPhone you

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,210
either had to be Apple or a partner like

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,980
Google who could deliver something like

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,890
YouTube or Google Maps onto the original

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,720
iPhone and that's sort of the world that

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,580
we have in public cloud today you know

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,830
it's a closed device where only the

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,290
cloud service providers ourselves are

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,750
able to deliver these native workloads

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,060
across the cloud and everyone else is

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,340
restricted to these no second-class

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,410
experiences you know in the case of

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,020
cloud software images or SAS

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,440
applications but if you fast forward now

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,120
to today's you know public cloud no we

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,070
can involve that to become much more

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,680
like today's smartphone market where

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,510
today Apple has their own App Store if

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,880
you go into the Android world you can

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:54,000
even install multiple application market

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,580
places onto the same smartphone and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,040
third-party applications first-party

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,290
applications run no differently on the

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,870
device itself and so we've switched the

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,490
smartphone from a closed device into an

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,200
open market for all these different

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,270
applications from the providers

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,860
themselves the device manufacturers as

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,960
well as from all these thriving app

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,240
developers and we can achieve that same

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,910
dynamic from a public cloud standpoint

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,470
by opening up access to say how can we

00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,870
all work together to be able to build

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,910
native manage services in the public

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,160
cloud versus just restricting that to a

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,810
very small handful of cloud providers in

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,570
the world today so this is something

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:36,060
that we've been working with in the

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:39,900
Linux Foundation for a little bit now so

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,840
we had a kickoff a workshop in Hong Kong

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,190
with a number of companies some of the

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,710
people who attended that workshop are

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,300
here in this room today and we talked a

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,430
lot about you know what are the

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,050
challenges that we see in common and

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,850
what are the challenges that we would

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,890
like to solve together in terms of how

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,170
do we create cloud services and help

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,280
work with our customers today so this

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,300
was just one slide

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,270
Accenture was there

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,620
so I took a picture of one of the

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,450
presentations that they gave around now

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,150
why did they see open services cloud is

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,890
beneficial but I've only had 20 minutes

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,480
to discuss with you and this has been a

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,520
long-running conversation we've been

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,220
having in the industry as well as with

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,110
Linux Foundation so tomorrow afternoon

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,480
we're gonna have a whole hour session

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,950
this is not on the website yet so I

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,230
invite you if you're interested take a

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,630
picture of this slide but tomorrow from

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,520
3 p.m. to 4 p.m. in Moss

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,410
we're gonna have a much longer time

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,270
together where we'll be able to go into

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,190
a lot more detail in terms of what are

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,560
we trying to do we run open services

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,960
cloud where are we already in the

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,850
process and where are we going from a

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,920
roadmap standpoint so this is something

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,470
that I would welcome all of you to come

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,180
and work with us and to discuss we think

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,100
that this is something that is really

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,960
really beneficial for every single no

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,660
person no that's here in this room today

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,120
because this is a way to amplify the

00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,700
power and the value of open-source as we

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,380
bring it into public cloud and so we're

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,020
looking to build this project in this

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,850
community in the open now working with

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,680
Linux Foundation and we invite all of

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,620
you to come and work with us as part of

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:16,250
this process thank you very much

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:16,250
