	Keynote: Open Services Cloud: A New Open Model - Bryan Che, Chief Strategy Officer, Huawei

There are many challenges and limitations for open source, IT industry vendors, and for enterprises in today’s public clouds. Even as cloud computing becomes the predominant IT platform, many of the traditional software and open source models of the past 20 years no longer apply well in a world of cloud services. And, newer approaches such as turning software into SaaS offerings on top of public clouds are not enough to address fundamental customer and ecosystem needs.

This session presents Open Services Cloud, a new open approach for cloud computing to address these challenges, and a new initiative with Linux Foundation to drive this into the industry.
