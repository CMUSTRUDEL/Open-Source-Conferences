all right we're gonna bring our next

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,810
panel up on stage and I'd like you all

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,309
to come this is a huge group of folks so

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm gonna have them all come up and

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,860
introduce themselves because it would be

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,969
a ten minute monologue if I do it so why

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,600
don't we have I think there they are

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:23,130
come on up panelists so we're going to

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,330
talk about investment startups in the

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,970
open source world

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,519
hey welcome and you know again on that

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,800
flywheel that I presented on Monday are

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,250
a Tuesday we have this open source

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,540
projects that beget commercial products

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,980
and services that beget value and profit

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,469
that provide for a reinvestment back

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,800
into the project better code more

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,960
products more features more value more

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,510
reinvestment and these folks are the

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,489
ones that are making that happen in

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,910
terms of making investment decisions in

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,090
terms of being entrepreneurs and so

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,129
forth so I'm going to start at that end

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,670
and if you could each introduce

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,799
yourselves quickly in hi folks my name

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,010
is Sarah Graham and co-founder and CEO

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,450
at platform 9 platform 9 I hope you're

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,400
listening to what subbu just said in the

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,020
previous panel running open source at

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,060
scale is hard that's the problem

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,850
platform line stalls we deliver open

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,830
source cloud frameworks as a service so

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,630
the idea is you get the time to value

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,479
and simplicity of operations of the

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,549
cloud but while using pure-play open

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,479
source frameworks like OpenStack

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,939
communities and phishing for service hi

companies jaspersoft

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,390
Mule soft Sona type in platform 9 and

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,960
have drawn some observations from those

did with SOI or what we're trying to do

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,420
is basically clearing the environment of

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,340
monolithic micro services and service

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,990
environment by cutting all the

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,020
infrastructure for function and

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,300
basically assemble application that

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,760
we're calling I were up and basically

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,620
give a cohesive way and we start with

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,800

associated with a cloud era investment

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,140
that in Tilted worked for an open-source

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,510
start up at Couchbase and have invested

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,120

International Women's Day everybody I'm

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,920
a partner at SATA venture partners which

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,350
is an early-stage VC firm that invests

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,860
in enterprise startups that solve

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,299
problems with big data and AI and we we

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,430
particularly like to invest in data

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,489
infrastructure and and see a lot of open

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,140
source in that direction before I joined

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,000
said I spent my whole career as an

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,700
engineer notably with long stints both

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,670
at VMware and Facebook and while those

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,140
were companies that mostly build

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,120
proprietary software we also released a

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,060
lot of open source and I got to be the

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,590
champion for a number of those projects

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,140
hi everyone my name is Jake Fullman Berg

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm a partner at Excel Excel is a global

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,500
venture capital firm that does a little

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
bit of everything in consumer and

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,880
enterprise from seed through growth

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,010
we've done over a dozen open source

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,520
investments over the years and I also

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,510
worked at cloud

00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,550
in the very early days I'm Erica Brescia

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,220
I'm the co-founder and CEO of a company

00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,560
called bitNami that is mostly known for

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,570
delivering a catalogue of over 150

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
open-source apps on all the major cloud

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,520
platforms we're also very active in the

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,590
open source community and kubernetes in

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
particular I've been in and around open

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,210
source since 2005

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm also an investment partner with

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,770
x-factor ventures which is a seed fund

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,140
that is investing in companies with at

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,420
least one female founder that is spun

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,730
out a flybridge and I have the honor of

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,770
serving as an at-large director on the

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,660
Linux Foundation board so I think I have

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,450
three different ways to look at the open

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,430
source investment discussion that is

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,440
very true and I can't help but say this

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,950
because it's not just the International

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:11,530
Women's Day

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:14,380
it is also Erica's birthday I'm so

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,860
flattered that you were here for this so

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,450
I want to start on the investor side

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,630
here and ask some of the investors that

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,910
are up on the panel you know when the

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,280
original sort of open source startup a

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,610
phase came in you know we talked Tuesday

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,250
about how it was all about commoditizing

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,810
markets and you know I think that over a

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,920
long period of time what you would hear

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,230
is like how can there ever be another

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Red Hat and are we naturally capping the

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,670
size of these firms based on you know

00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,350
just taking a big market making it

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,550
smaller in that Tam is all we're gonna

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:51,610
get how has the investment thesis around

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,860
open source startups in your experience

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,890
over time changed what what are you

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,060
seeing today are effective I think all

00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,520
right I'll start with you and then go

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,860
over to Gary and then come over here

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,250
folks from Excel sure so we've seen it

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:10,030
go a little bit I would say in a wave

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,770
pattern so I would say back in 2010 2011

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,260
there was definitely a lot of appetite

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,080
for investments which kind of dipped a

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,930
little bit I would say in 2015 2016 and

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,240
then we saw things coming back again at

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,500
I mean at least from the the investors

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
and folks that I work with there's

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,280
definitely a lot of interest in

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,360
evaluating and investing in open source

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,000
startups

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,879
if you look at the exit path for some of

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,740
the recent exits that companies have had

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,469
either in the public market or as an

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,330
acquisition it has proven to be pretty

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,250
good I would say so Microsoft acquired

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,909
xamarin and - those were pretty good

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,599
multiples for those acquiring companies

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:49,180
 cloudera

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,280
all went IPO recently and they're doing

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,550
pretty well so far on the public market

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,250
- core OS got bought by Red Hat at a

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,680
pretty good multiple for the company and

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,159
so we're definitely seeing these exits

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,289
as signs that there is good appetite for

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,960
the acquirers as well as for the public

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,849
markets depending on I mean the value

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,129
proposition that these companies have

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,590
and what they have to offer even in

00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:16,840
terms of the investment activity the

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,199
fear of ketamine recent investments by

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,370
Redis or data breaks there's definitely

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,560
good appetite from the investment

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,259
committee community in being able to

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,169
fund these companies yeah yeah Jocelyn

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,909
what are you seeing well you know I feel

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,710
like just as in the Red Hat days there

00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,639
was this idea that I mean I think these

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,810
days are always concerned with

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,039
monetization and how you're gonna

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,169
monetize something that that

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,430
fundamentally is free and I think that

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,750
you know sort of Red Hat was the only

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,400
one who seemed to seriously make a go of

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,199
well the software is free but will sell

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,699
support and then I think the cloud came

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,469
along and there was this idea of okay

00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,909
maybe hosting is an alternative path the

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,770
software's free but will host it and

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,960
make money that way and I think we also

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,810
have yet to see really big successes

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,080
come there but I think where we have

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,219
seen big successes all but certainly

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,650
Rashmi named a bunch of good ones but

00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:04,539
when all point to is github where

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,490
they're killing it on the monetization

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,129
side telling an enterprise product with

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,020
an enterprise feature set with a free

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,939
open-source version that does not in the

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,639
least feel artificially crippled or

00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,560
constrained by its user base and so I

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,990
think to me the github model is the

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,979
really exciting inspiring one which is

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,839
can you identify a proprietary business

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,610
model on top of the foundation that's

00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,830
free and open source and not that's not

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,689
crippled where yeah Gary I want to go to

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,969
you and then come over to Jake yeah sure

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,459
so I think your your your question is

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,979
how's it how's the investors view

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,680
changed over time right and I mention I

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,510
made for open source related investments

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,930
and two of those that have exited I

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,580
think are good point counter points

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:54,880
first one 2002 was was jaspersoft it got

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,180
acquired ten years later actually 2004

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,110
we acquired jasperreports it ten years

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:05,640
later was sold to TIBCO for 185 million

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:10,000
dollars the second one was 2006 again

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,570
two founders backed them and eleven

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,660
years later IPO and that company has a

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,540
market cap of about four now billion now

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,010
both had great teams both had really

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,660
good investors multiple rounds and so

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,700
what made them different I think we got

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,660
into both of those investments thinking

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,279
hey with open source we can provide 80%

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,620
of the functionality for 20% of the

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,589
price take a ten billion dollar total

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,750
market cram it down to three billion and

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,860
be in win the lion's share of it I mean

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,240
that was kind of the open source right

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,560
thought there Martin mikoshi say that

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,400
about my sequel for the early based

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,290
market I think what we found was you

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,830
know the people who love open source or

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,140
developers developers don't have money

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,000
and if they have money they don't want

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:09,339
to spend it but open source is great for

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,930
basically you know being distributed in

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,500
viral growth within the developer

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,390
community what makes a better business

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,180
model and github is a good example is

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,040
when you're actually even though you're

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,779
getting developer adoption you're

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,110
actually monetizing at a different layer

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:28,630
so in the case of jaspersoft its market

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,640
was selling to developers and their

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,890
number one competitor they became the

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,930
most widely used reporting solution

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,450
their number one competitor was indeed

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:43,029
the free free version it was good enough

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,760
and and so that limited this opportunity

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,910
no soft which was an enterprise service

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,130
bus touched thousands of servers

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,890
thousands applications there's really no

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,690
way you'd go live without having a

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,550
relationship with the company in not

00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,110
only a relationship with service you

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,990
better have the bells and whistles with

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,240
the management console and the reporting

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,570
and and everything that goes into is

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,880
managing all those API is easy so the

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,400
value is monetized at the IT obscene

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,339
right and that layer and they would pay

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,410
good money to keep those companies up

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,329
and going and have visibility when there

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,500
was a problem that kind of got him from

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:25,720
maybe the 18k up to the six-figure deals

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,329
but still six-figure deal what got them

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,250
into the seven-figure an eight-figure

00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:36,339
per year deals was when they actually

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,610
got up to the c-suite and so it went

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,230
from operational at the IT ops level to

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,329
strategic and then they were selling

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,310
digital transformation and agility of

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,900
changing business models that's when

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,060
they got up to seven figure and they

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,100
announced they have at the last earnings

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,250
announcement 45 customers paying them a

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,470
million dollars per year or more so now

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,720
that's been my lessons I think open

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,970
source as a business model great for

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,610
adoption really poor for monetization

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,540
unless you're monetizing at different

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,270
levels yeah

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,860
so Jake I save you for less because

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,839
being a ping Lee's book at this event

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,120
last year I would add that I saw the

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,020
dais in Microsoft people talking in the

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,910
corner at this event then oddly right

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,390
after a hussar Jake you know you down to

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,850
Excel you guys have done a lot of work

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,650
analyzing this concept of you know

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,940
projects and then the transition to

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,279
getting customer requirements

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,959
privatization and looked at like the

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,839
balance sheets across pretty wide

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,459
portfolio that you have like share some

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,410
of the insights that you see that you

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:44,020
know you're looking for in these firms

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,150
in terms of where efficiencies game your

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,310
like what does open source sir you know

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,790
so I'd make one one passing comment and

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,560
and I sort of think success in a sense

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,480
will be when we stop talking about open

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,650
source business model like what it like

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,600
we don't talk about that a private airy

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,830
business model like what is open source

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,779
open source is a development model

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,790
and and and so we we lump so many things

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,120
into this bucket and it may be just a

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,399
few data points it back before shortcut

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,990
to 2005 there's two to three hundred

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,200
million dollars go of like private

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,990
venture capital going in into open

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,880
source companies if you look past past

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,560
four or five years over a billion pretty

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,970
steady steadily you could argue that

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,829
maybe there's a dip but it's just a

00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,589
couple of these mega pre IPO rounds that

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:30,920
sort of skew things you've gone from two

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,920
to three publicly traded open-source

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,420
company is to steady cadence depending

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,640
on where you draw the line of what is an

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,579
actual open source company sure entering

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,730
the the IPO pipeline so a lot more

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:45,170
public market liquidity and and you've

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,089
gone from a world where a lot of things

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,070
were monolith and siloed and worked on a

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,390
single node to a world in which things

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,130
are inherently more distributed and

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,350
therefore more complicated to operate

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,690
which is a much better I think substrate

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,430
for for building a business you've gone

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,519
to a world now where there's this sort

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,149
of as as a service if you in dimension

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,970
to the the thoughts around monetization

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,980
but I mean like if I had to sort of

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,270
summarize that is and I don't know if

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,649
this is true at the application layer

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,100
yet but certainly at the infrastructure

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,180
layer

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,890
we've gone from a world where

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,750
open-source is the exception to

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,740
open-source is is the rule like I mean

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,540
there's probably at least two dozen

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,520
venture firms that invest a lot in

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,810
open-source now and like I bet they've

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,890
got all those guys ourselves to

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,640
including would sort of ask yourself a

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,560
question if you building another

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,600
database it's like not why would it be

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,730
open source if sort of why wouldn't and

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,829
I think that's a fundamental change over

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,079
the past decade in terms of the way we

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:41,300
look at these startups we break it into

00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,329
what we call this 3p framework project

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,649
product profit and and simply what that

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,510
means is if you can't build a project

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,100
that people care about in a truly

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,660
meaningful way and deploy in a

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,339
mission-critical use case who cares

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,829
right like just like it's not relevant

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,180
to us and there's lots of wonderful open

00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:58,490
source where that where the goal is not

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,470
necessarily that but if you can deploy

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,360
in a you know a big meaningful

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,160
mission-critical way you sort of achieve

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,620
that that first milestone and then the

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,850
next question becomes like what's the

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,110
product what are the balance of what's

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,430
free what's the balance of what's not

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,380
there's some things that are really

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,060
simple on the security and maybe

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,260
authentication side where there's never

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,160
been a case in the world where you

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,840
that out to the open-source community

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
and someone raises their hand and say

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,690
hey I'd love to build that on average

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,130
that doesn't happen that are easy

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,810
there's other things that are much more

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,820
complicated do you hold back the

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,740
distributed version or not do you only

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,120
do the SAS version and not have the

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,650
enterprise version and I don't think

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,630
there's a lot of good answers but I do

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,670
think that we're seeing a lot more

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,680
innovative business models now than

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,630
support and services right and

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,610
supporting services just on average

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,420
won't give you the margin structure to

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,820
reinvest and continually you know build

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,470
more into the business and open source

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,230
has been a great tell when marketing in

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,180
a sense for adoption and that you change

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,970
from these sort of hunters to go find

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,830
people to to maybe farmers how do you

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,320
how do you tease out from that open

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,610
source community who is gonna be a free

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,410
user who's gonna be a fifty thousand

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,690
dollar user who is the potential to be a

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,790
seven-figure user over time and those

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,110
are the sorts of things we study you

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,400
know as we look to invest in these

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,900
companies I want to ask you one question

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,880
then move on to the entrepreneurs here

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,800
because you know you mentioned about you

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,450
know where it's sort of the norm you

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,120
just look at it as a company open-source

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,830
is sort of the norm at this point but

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,110
these efficiencies around marketing and

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,370
calling through the big amount of

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,540
interest that will come in through an

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,940
open source project that sort of goes

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,070
viral are you seeing that reflected in

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,720
the actual balance sheets like the

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,850
entrepreneurs are listening here like is

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,530
marketing gonna go it's gonna be cheaper

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,010
is gonna be more expensive are you gonna

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:42,050
go down is are you gonna go up if I had

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,570
to say I would I would almost argue that

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,280
our R&D is a little higher and marketing

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,690
is a little lower on most open source

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,510
companies compared to our traditional

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,820
enterprise there's sometimes there are

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,770
economies of having a big community

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,840
participate sometimes there's governance

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,230
challenges sometimes things are harder

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,780
harder to move forward but you know you

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,900
go from this there's a huge difference

00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,699
in qualification from someone that has

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,050
never heard of your product so someone

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,060
that's using it and we sort of call this

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,949
tack who like what's your total

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,470
addressable community and like what's

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,260
the process of converting you know that

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,940
active community member into a paid

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,010
customer and if that activation energy

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,160
isn't actually cheaper than a

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,800
traditional sales cycle by some margin

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,510
you've broken something yeah you

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,170
you have firms that are actually

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:36,110
measuring the acquisition at the project

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,210
level from a financial sense I think it

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,130
you know I would call it in the early

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,140
days aspirational but when you get to

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,900
scale when you're on that half from you

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,850
know 20 million air are up to what it

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,700
takes to become public you absolutely

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,770
have to measure it and and in it's so

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,290
you know these big deals can can change

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,350
the dynamics but it's really a question

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,670
of not holding them to a bar maybe in

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,950
that very early stage but getting a

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,260
habit of measurement like what is the

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,400
metric that is actually meaningful and

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,320
having the conversation with the

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,790
entrepreneurs to define those metrics

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,590
upfront and say you can do whatever you

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,060
want for now but like you know gosh

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,940
you're gonna have to you're gonna have

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,350
to achieve these sorts of efficiencies

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,730
what are the open source metrics that

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,980
you might look for as a public market

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,330
investor but but also oh by the way like

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,710
if you don't hit all the normal

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,540
traditional enterprise software metrics

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,620
it like you're not gonna get you know

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,960
you're not gonna be rewarded by the

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,580
public markets anyway yeah Jim sorry can

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,470
I make a comment on this data point I

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,390
think I just had this conversation with

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,860
a successful open source founder who

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,870
exited who I won't name because he

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,140
didn't give me permission but we were

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,720
talking about they're not gonna answer

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,700
that there but he just told me like we

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,010
suck at marketing and so we put our

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,990
money in an Rd and that's art that's

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,220
part of our go-to-market strategy and

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,900
they were literally looking at this

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,460
trade-off like we're not going to invest

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,200
in marketing we're gonna invest a whole

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,910
lot in the open source and building an

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,010
ecosystem in a community and using that

00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,720
as the driver for adoption and

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,860
visibility and it clearly worked out

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,970
quite well it's definitely

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,710
counterintuitive though because you

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,150
always think of this great shared R&D

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,440
effort out there but you're telling me

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,990
on your balance sheets you're seeing

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,850
actually higher R&D a big value is in

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,710
the marketing which I think it is super

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,350
interesting I want to go to the

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,760
entrepreneurs now because one thing that

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,350
I do think in addition to marketing

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,700
efficiency that I want to ask you all

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,000
about just in your fundraising

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,280
experience and in a prior life I did

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,580
rounds of fundraising and pitched a lot

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,340
of venture firms in the valley is the

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,570
open source component of your business

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,080
with the fact that you can hang your hat

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,920
on being an open sourcing is it we say

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,810
fundraising efficiency that you're

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,190
getting out of it is is clearly on the

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,630
accel side there they don't care either

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,420
way

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,950
Jake's been very clear on that but do

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,690
you see that as you're going around and

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,570
pitching different firms all yeah Eric

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,570
I'll start with you first no it's silly

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,970
no well no we're bootstraps so I mean

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,560
but not in an interesting position there

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,380
but I'm also an investor and I will tell

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,510
you know like I I do expect like Jake

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,460
said and I think maybe Jocelyn mentioned

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,410
like almost every company has some

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,360
aspect of open source in their strategy

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,950
at least in the software space now like

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,690
there's there's they're either using or

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,640
building around open source like look at

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,260
the kubernetes ecosystem for example

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,850
where companies are investing heavily

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,290
there and then building products around

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:22,260
it and networking in but but does the

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:24,790
halo of like kubernetes help you - yeah

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,180
a lot of announcements of kubernetes

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,700
based startups raising some pretty big

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,680
take they're looking at you but I would

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,110
I would say that's not necessarily

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,820
because it's open source by definition I

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,130
would say it's because it's popular and

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,720
it has a ton of momentum and it achieved

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,520
that of course because it's open source

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,350
but somebody who doesn't come at least

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,730
to me and say hey I'm running an open

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,200
source company and I'm like holy cow I

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,610
want to invest in that company because

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,500
they're an open-source right it's

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,780
because they're in a hot space with a

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,580
ton of momentum that happens to have

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,080
achieved that because of the nature of

00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,210
the open source project that the

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,130
companies are being built around

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,930
interesting interesting I mean at

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,250
platform you're you're riding the you

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,190
know you mentioned several open source

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,480
projects in your inter introduction a

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,010
platform line was that a useful thing

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,630
for you going out and raising money and

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,480
you know the tricky thing with this

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,400
question is that my investors yeah you

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
are the worst possible so you're putting

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:23,560
me under that's ok Gary is gonna talk

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:27,760
any book all work if you can I think

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,650
that fundraising is like a sale and as a

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,450
sales person the CEOs essentially the

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,510
entrepreneurs essentially trying to make

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,090
a sale and I think as a salesperson you

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,160
want to control every aspect of the

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,610
conversation and the whole open-source

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,810
thing can really get in the way of that

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,960
we didn't start the company by the way I

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,190
this platform line thing is my first

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,630
thing with open stores it's my first and

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,160
last startup I don't think we were I was

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,750
a gamer with Jocelyn

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,860
she was a lowly engineer she was a big

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,049
shot so she doesn't know me from that

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,190
but the thing is like we didn't we

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,100
didn't come from an open-source

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,130
background we we wanted to make clouds

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,650
easier to run and when we started with

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,210
that we said why would we go and retool

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,559
all the stuff that OpenStack has done

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,750
and all the stuff that containers are

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:15,760
gonna do so we said that makes no sense

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,870
we want to solve the core operational

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,450
challenge the challenge that subbu

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,910
talked about earlier which is operating

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,860
clouds is hard and it doesn't matter

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,929
where they use closed source or open

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,140
source that operational challenges what

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,250
we do as a company and so I think you

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,110
know it was really interesting for me

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,429
there was this project OpenStack that

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,929
everybody boot likes to believe is dead

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,390
except that everybody's running VMs

00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,179
everywhere you look right and I say you

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,770
know this thing is white-hot except that

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,539
there's no one using it at scale I mean

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,070
I'd love to see Ticketmaster stats but

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,020
I've been in Tibet more than 90% of

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,549
their workloads are running on VMs so

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,570
the best part about this event is you

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,400
can get that info just so my point is

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,309
that like I think it gets in the way

00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,190
you know you at least my perspective is

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,360
our value proposition yes open source is

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,280
a core part of a value proposition

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,390
proposition to the customer but from a

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,280
financing perspective

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,450
you know timing is everything and

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,980
there's wind blowing you know there's a

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,080
crosswind on OpenStack there's a

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,940
tailwind on kubernetes serverless is

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:20,679
white-hot who wants that well I happen

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,090
to be a fan of kubernetes myself ease is

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,080
the next OpenStack two years from now

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,340
it's gonna be somebody's gonna be

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,140
beating up on it would be hard about

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,370
something else I totally agree in fact I

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,770
was at a venture event one day and

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:33,490
someone came up a partner came up to me

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,840
and said you know we create value at our

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,250
firm and you know that's what we work

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,929
with others what does the Linux

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:43,870
Foundation do and I replied well we

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:45,730
destroy value no I'm kidding you know

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,289
again I really believe in what Jake's

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,940
saying which is if you don't have a

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,320
commercial feedback loop here these

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,409
things aren't sustainable and you get an

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,580
open SSL or you get an NTP tierno

00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:58,480
position to where these you know one

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,130
person maintaining this this is a the

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,140
investor side of that we found

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,140
platform nine when we're looking at

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,820
opportunities kubernetes and serverless

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,890
okay so you did I want to go to you

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,570
because you

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,640
are you sort of characterized as an

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,890
open-source company just because that's

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,660
where the cloud is at right so first of

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,460
all I'm a little bit strange because I'm

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,930
in the East Coast and when you're going

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,820
to invest in the East Coast and during

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,960
an open source they don't even

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,960
understand what you're talking about

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,340
they're really kind of like wow and and

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,400
I make it more than scientists because

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm a solo founder in the East Coast and

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,500
a woman so that wasn't a very very easy

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,080
country

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,940
I know so that's that I mean there is an

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,780
idea first of all that wasn't like what

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,820
I'm doing right now is not my first

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,620
project there was a CEO a city or any

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,880
EMC cloud management division we

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,730
open-source a project that was

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,680
relatively successful right and then

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,510
when I started this company for my

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,700
opinion this is to be fair the only way

00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,560
and I will explain what I mean I mean

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,320
there's a lot of good engineers out

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,060
there a lot but I believe that there's

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,620
not a lot of innovate there is anybody

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,990
but not a lot they were like to note

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,690
that common and I believe that once they

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,670
ip's out there then everybody can go and

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,650
build it because that's not that how at

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,620
least not for my team princess I can

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,300
build everything that is out there so

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,130
for me once I'm already saying that I be

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,450
here's what I'm going to do if I'm not

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,950
going to open source it's someone else

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,010
will go and do and guess what it would

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,880
be more popular than me so I don't think

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,950
that I have a choice

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,600
and and not like other we think that the

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,940
way to make money from their opening

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,080
opinion is actually to make up you know

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,360
money to me you know I don't know

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,890
services so we will not open source

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,610
everything I actually think that the way

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,100
to be better

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,480
it's just innovate constantly if you're

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,610
looking at a company like Apple for

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,460
instance there was like just before the

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,650
fire and they let Steve Jobs go

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,750
basically the fight there inside was

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,610
that Steve job was constantly wanted to

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,430
continue innovative idea I wanted to do

00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,960
the Apple too right so I believe in

00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,550
steam right I really mean is way and I

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,640
think that what I'm planning to do there

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,020
is just a we just open-source a project

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,820
we already has six months ahead of it

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,200
right and basically what we continue

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,150
going to do is we're going to continue

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,710
putting innovation on we want to leave

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,300
this market we don't want to you know we

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,370
want to come with the idea and with the

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,070
direction and I believe that we'll see

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,480
what what happened to me I I love the

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,620
way you describe that because you know I

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,510
always talk from from the

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,490
the source project side as hey these

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,340
projects are simply raising the

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,950
innovation right like you know this is

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,530
stuff that's sort of continually pushing

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,170
things commodity but to to essentially

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,730
monetize you better get high up the

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,890
bottom on the Investor side and I'm

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,540
gonna come back to you what are you

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,150
seeing in terms of is that innovation

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,430
bar driving but the more as an investor

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,680
where do you look at the line there

00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,650
where do you have an investment thesis

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,420
on man if you're not adding value above

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,980
this particular area I'm not even

00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,610
interested in looking at you as a

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,559
company boy I mean I'd love to say

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,210
there's like a specific quantity or unit

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,000
of measure and it and it's way more art

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,800
than science but yeah I mean I totally

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,270
agree actually with what you're saying

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,550
and I also want to tie this back to

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,559
something that Jake said earlier which

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,270
is that and I think collectively the

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,500
panel said earlier which is the beauty

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,510
of open source from an investor's

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,670
perspective is distribution not

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,340
innovation right is its contribution to

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,170
to marketing not to R&D and I wish I

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,850
could cite this quote but it's I I don't

00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,260
know who said it but but it's so great I

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,270
have to share the thought anyway which

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,980
is it's something like look startups are

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,540
in a race with big companies startups

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,550
have innovation big companies have

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,230
distribution and you're in a race to get

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,870
distribution before the big company can

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,470
get innovation right and so I think that

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:43,330
in an open source in you it gives you

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,910
such a leg up on the distribution side

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,170
that it's almost it's it's it's you know

00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,390
especially on the infrastructure side I

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,620
think it is de facto mandatory I mean I

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,730
invest in a lot of very early-stage

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,500
companies where were the first

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,390
institutional money and you're talking

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,440
to any infrastructure startup and one of

00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,240
the debates they're having early on is

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,990
should we open source or should we not

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,580
and and so getting back around to the

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,890
question you asked me like the debate is

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,320
also what an open source like where to

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,690
draw the line on what is free and what

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,580
you hold back and try to monetize and I

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,050
would say the crucial principle for me

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,610
in those conversations I'm not really

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,830
wearing my investor hat I'm kind of

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,210
wearing my entrepreneur and operator hat

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,380
because I'm just trying to think of what

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,790
will make the business the most

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,650
successful it can be and and in those

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:30,490
conversations to me the crucial

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,900
principle is is backlash are you giving

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,670
something crippled are you giving

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,070
something that is like a you know a

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,530
a toy that like maybe is useful too and

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,300
and I think that that if developers I

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,890
mean I just think you know developers

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,540
are not you know children they're not

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,580
dummies right and if you call something

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,660
open-source but it's really trivial and

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,700
the only way to get the full

00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,090
functionality or do anything outside of

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,190
a demo with it is is to is to pay then

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,530
that's I don't think going to have the

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,760
currency that the you know nobody's

00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,230
going to get wildly excited about

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,240
contributing to that or sharing it or

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,610
building a community around it so I

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,530
think what's what's crucial is that you

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,240
have something that feels for all

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,010
intents and purposes really

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,590
full-featured really valuable really

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,300
nails my problem especially if I'm

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,700
working on my own or I'm doing research

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,920
or I'm doing something as a hobbyist and

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,690
the only time it sort of feels but but

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,560
that those enterprise features then

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,300
you're worried about competing with

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,070
yourself right that the free thing is

00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,720
good enough and so what's crucial is to

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,220
have an enterprise feature set where if

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,300
somebody's really running this at

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,730
immense scale if somebody's really

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,020
making a ton of money off of it by god

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,400
I've got to have the features that are

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,800
there in the Enterprise Edition and

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,300
that's I wish there was a silver bullet

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,220
you know if there was like a clearly

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,300
identifiable set of features but it's

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,490
just so dependent on a

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,440
project-by-project basis but the ones

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,120
that that find that way to thread that

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,610
needle where it feels so full-featured

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,920
for the hobbyist or the solo project but

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,160
so essential to pay for the Enterprise

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,710
Edition if you want commercial scale if

00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,990
you find that I think you've got it

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,520
Erica you you you know it seems like you

00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,100
do a lot of work on making that

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,010
operational efficiency really you know

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,480
providing huge value what bring us into

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,640
some of the debates internally at

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,830
bitNami about like where this line is

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,480
where's the innovation bar what do we

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,600
you know how do you think about that

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,120
it's I mean so but Nami is interesting

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,890
because most of what we do at the core

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,530
of it Nami is actually not open source

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:27,010
right we build value around open source

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,530
and the company has bootstraps itself to

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,060
the point we're at by packaging and

00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,800
delivering this open source it's kind of

00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,870
like almost like the Red Hat model for

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,730
applications that we're more focused on

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,230
kind of hardening and delivering

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,420
something that will run out of the box

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,670
so that's been very clear but we did

00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,560
just launch our first commercial product

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,330
last week which is direct to the

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,940
enterprise which is a product ization of

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,160
our

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,470
fooling so that others can package up

00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,580
their apps for all of these the

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,130
different platforms of Phenom II

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,130
supports and there's been a lot of talk

00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,320
around which pieces of that will be open

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,300
source in which won't and right now it's

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,640
completely proprietary and that's

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,430
because going to what Jocelyn said I

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,590
think it is really key to provide value

00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,870
and we see ourselves in providing value

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,660
in the assets that we generate out of

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:17,660
bitNami and so we've separated kind of

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,430
where we're monetizing the business from

00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,680
like we're delivering a ton of value and

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,690
the tooling for now is proprietary now

00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,920
over time we may open source that but

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,990
one of the things that I wanted to say

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,520
is you can also go too far like there

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,500
are plenty of companies that have given

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,000
away everything and at the risk of

00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,860
getting Tomatoes thrown at me like

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,630
docker I think is a good example of this

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,280
right they there's a lot of things you

00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,560
could say about docker but they gave

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,850
away so much initially without a clear

00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,470
business model and I think now the

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,270
company is starting to build a business

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,790
around it but it took a lot longer than

00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,950
planned and that's because I think you

00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,050
need to be very thoughtful about how

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,000
much you do open source and once you go

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,250
open source it's pretty hard to go back

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,540
and I mean look at the Sugar CRM having

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,060
to go through that it's not an easy

00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,340
process sure I mean anything good I mean

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,510
certainly there was a lot of marketing

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,790
efficiency and docker though we will

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,430
give them full credit on that I mean

00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:11,570
that you do a Google Trends to search on

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:12,680
docker and it's absolutely rush me I

00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,610
want to talk to you about sort of the

00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,870
mindset of a strategic venture firm in

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:22,610
Microsoft are you looking at specific

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,950
technologies and then trying to invest

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,900
around that like what what how do you

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,900
come up with your investment thesis yeah

00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,820
so we typically try and stay I'm gonna

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,110
say at least five years ahead of what

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,010
the product teams are building

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,690
internally benefit of being part of this

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,910
newly founded investment team at

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,680
Microsoft is we're not strategic so we

00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,050
don't require a business unit approval

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,270
to do a deal although we do check for

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,650
alignment with Microsoft down the line

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,290
which may not haven't happen immediately

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,660
but maybe down the line when it comes to

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,060
open sources definitely I would say in

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,390
the new Microsoft world there's a ton of

00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,780
interest and excitement about what else

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,880
can we do in the open source

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,890
so I'm pretty stoked that Microsoft is

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,770
the number one contributor in open

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:11,340
source projects we have about 12,000

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,020
15,000 open source committers there's 24

00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,450
projects across a variety of different

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:20,340
ways all the way from linux kernel to

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,900
dotnet core to kubernetes and darker and

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,200
a variety of different projects

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,730
internally so when we come at our

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,650
investment thesis and what would be

00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:31,200
areas that would be interesting it's

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,909
really anywhere up and down all the way

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,360
from infrastructure to databases to

00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:39,090
analytics to enterprise applications so

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,309
we look at the entire stack what we're

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,690
really looking for our companies are

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,309
going back to what Jocelyn and Jake were

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,559
saying it's companies that can really

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,000
produce a differentiated offering it's

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,250
not just doing open source for the sake

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,510
of doing open source but what really can

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,820
drive a lot of community engagement

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,130
around it what can you build a solid

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,140
monetization model around it and more

00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,850
importantly how are you going to make

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,860
sure that you don't get killed by the

00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,559
next AWS announcement and reinvent

00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,799
saying there's a surprise and now your

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,990
your company is just dead so those those

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,399
would be the three key points and just

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,159
like any other financial investor we

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,020
care about financial returns but at the

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,119
same time there's a lot of value that we

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,070
can provide to these companies through

00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,720
all of microsoft assets and the

00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,570
excitement that we have internally for

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,899
open source III can't help but riff on

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:30,990
that question and when you eat it do you

00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:35,040
live in fear of your company becoming a

00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:36,540
AWS feature there is a lot of company

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,800
there's the things that I thought I

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,720
noticed one of them is there's there's

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,149
own a company or really seek to be

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,349
partnership with Amazon and I just don't

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,089
get it because they never bought a

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,530
companies but they don't think I'm

00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,480
closer to the companies and they're

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,070
basically killing them so that's really

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,500
kind of like strength strategic that I

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:55,500
see people doing the second thing is

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,480
that I'm not because what I'm offer is

00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,920
always I would up right they will never

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,990
do that right their motivation is to

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,000
stay in a cloud I don't care right I

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,890
mean I want to go to Microsoft I want to

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,599
go to Google I want to do this on from

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,339
stuff and they will never will right so

00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,770
this is will always be my advantage and

00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm always working on layer 7 under

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,130
stuck which means that they cannot take

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,599
anything from

00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,930
you know what I mean so they cannot

00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:21,589
block that right so all of these

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:24,170
together make me feel very very listen

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:25,970
it's interesting you mentioned you know

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,259
how they don't do at least Amazon you

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,009
don't see a lot of M&A activity but I

00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:32,960
want to go to Gary and Jake here on you

00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,579
know you expect some outcomes here you

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,319
know you want a liquidity event at some

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,900
point are you seeing any particular

00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:41,569
trends in terms of more M&A activity

00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,430
more you know public market activity you

00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:45,170
know relative to these open source

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,259
centric type companies or are we just

00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,059
beyond that at this point with the the

00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:53,720
firms that we see you know going into

00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:56,299
the public markets these days that's

00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,589
it's a it's a really good question it's

00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:58,700
interesting what's the companies get at

00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:02,450
scale

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,809
most of our CEOs don't publicly describe

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,920
themselves as open source companies

00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:09,500
because they want to operate at a layer

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,829
that conveys more that they're not

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,069
focused as a tool that providing value

00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:19,160
at a at a higher level and they also

00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:20,710
want to be again not something that's

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,309
cheaper but something that is

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,809
future-proofed and better than what all

00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:30,079
the alternatives are in the marketplace

00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:34,670
so I think they really are describing

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,500
value and momentum and aspe and Rita net

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,410
retention that's what they're selling

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,839
yet as opposed to position themselves

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,009
those open source companies yeah Jake it

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,920
sounds like you're seeing similar things

00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:47,150
or yeah I mean and I like the fact that

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,549
these companies aren't necessarily

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,259
leading with it this sort of development

00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:52,460
model open source right there if you're

00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:54,619
gonna go public just lead with the

00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,910
metrics and if you have 80% gross margin

00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,619
you're gonna get valued like a

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,049
traditional enterprise software company

00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:01,819
and if you you know have a 25% margin

00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,089
you're gonna be valued as as something

00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,890
else

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:05,839
I think we've certainly seen over the

00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:09,410
past year and a half and looking for the

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,420
next year arise and the IPOs that are

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,119
fundamentally open source companies I

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,759
think we've seen a small uptick in buys

00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,619
of medium scale open source companies

00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:21,710
and including some you know pretty

00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:22,730
recent transactions I think you know the

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,710
rest of the world is getting more

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,270
comfortable I do

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,800
think there's still some holdouts I do

00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,720
you think there's still some large

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,099
corporate entities that are still

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,480
scratching their head a little bit and

00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,680
they're like we what are we buying like

00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,510
aren't all the contributors going to

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,819
leave after we buy them and maybe they

00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:39,880
don't have the right culture or

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:42,339
processes in place to take advantage of

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,270
them and that's not gone that is that is

00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:49,540
certainly declining and then you know

00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:51,760
the other the other mega trend that I

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,700
think we're seeing is this this great

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,619
concern relative to the cloud vendors

00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,599
and no disrespect and we'll we've Linux

00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,130
out but like it's not that it's not the

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,530
old world guys there's not worried about

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,690
like hey is like is IBM gonna come take

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,339
our lunch that's not what these startups

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,010
are worried about it's like very

00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:11,710
specifically the the big three you know

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,569
like newer cloud providers and that's

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,309
forcing a lot of a lot more thought to

00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,210
go into the business models in these

00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:18,940
companies a lot sooner

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,200
interesting interesting what one of the

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,339
questions we asked earlier in the week

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:27,640
is ha what how can an open source

00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:29,980
project be a super good upstream to your

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,329
downstream monetization models and all

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,210
that of this both to the investors end

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:36,930
to the entrepreneurs in terms of what do

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:39,819
you really look for there you look for

00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,440
sourcing do you look for a huge

00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:43,359
momentous trend are you looking at a

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
particular technology value what do you

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,099
what what makes for a super good

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,710
upstream open source project in terms of

00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,940
that downstream monetization I'll throw

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,650
it to anyone it looks like an investment

00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,760
I think that first of all I need to look

00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,319
at the code and see how good it is

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,970
really because that's the foundation so

00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,920
I have to make sure that is a solid not

00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,720
all the open source project are solid I

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,490
want to see that the use case is make

00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,140
sense to what I want to build and then

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,970
of course trending I mean to be fair I

00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,940
want to piggyback on the others but it's

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,319
really actually really good for me right

00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,270
yeah so piggybacking on the tribe it

00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,520
starts with good code is it's all some

00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,380
kind of problem anything by the way that

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,000
often shows that for my opinion this is

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,530
graded by putting the open the project

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,030
out there and can I give you an example

00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,460
of something that we wanted to do in my

00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,980
company and it's one of my engineer is

00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,270
basically offer a hack and I said to him

00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,799
that's will never happen we're putting

00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,780
it out there everybody will see that

00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:33,069
isn't everyone so I think that at least

00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,930
for me what is important is you put a

00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:38,520
cure very very good code outer because

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,109
that's my branding on my company someone

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,760
will look at it I said this is maybe a

00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:43,740
nice idea but the implementation is not

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,579
good they will never buy it right so I

00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,990
don't know go look at my for DAC so if I

00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,430
didn't and I'm very like every line

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,290
there I'm going over because I don't

00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,790
know it's my name on there right yeah

00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,559
Erica how about you I would add to that

00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,900
in addition to good code like good

00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,819
governance and I'm obviously biased but

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,339
you know being a part of a foundation

00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:03,960
with a very clear set of directions and

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,730
goals like I think that's part of the

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,710
reason that kubernetes has been so

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,790
successful in addition to being like a

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,240
very interesting and innovative

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:14,160
technology it's the governance around

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,780
kubernetes and the way that Google put

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,520
it into the foundation and now a

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,260
community has been built around it like

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,849
you don't want to build a business

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,530
around something where you don't have

00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:24,300
some degree of certainty of the

00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,160
longevity of the project and the

00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,079
momentum of the project and it's really

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,660
hard to get that if it's just coming out

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,760
of say a company that might have

00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,280
ulterior motives right yeah yeah good

00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,390
good point so I'm hearing you know

00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,690
obviously starts all with the code and

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:42,030
the innovation their governance the

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,319
ecosystem aking off of that that big

00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,849
momentum trend that sort of just

00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:49,829
starting well what else any anybody else

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:51,720
go ahead sir you know one one point I'd

00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:53,460
say is also about value innovation I

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,549
think the days when open-source was a

00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,680
way to do 20% of the price 80% of the

00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:00,839
value you know communities is an example

00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,250
of a project which you know in some ways

00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,990
you could use it as an alternative some

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,910
existing traditional technologies but in

00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,380
many ways it's actually I think Justin

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,760
said this right they were looking at

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,690
this as a way to build better software

00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,480
and it was not a cheapo VMware you know

00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,920
so I think that to me is opening up a

00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,510
new market it's it's about you reading

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,910
ultimately all of us investors

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,799
entrepreneurs together are we creating

00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,930
are we moving the the world forward

00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,660
right away I view that as a key aspect

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,770
of any significant open source project

00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,920
because ultimately it's about creating

00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,540
economic value for the world the only

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,030
one thing I would add is just making

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,770
sure that we or our portfolio companies

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,049
read the fine print on the licensing

00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,420
models because there's just so many

00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:44,640
different varieties in how the licensing

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,160
models work so does it mean that if you

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,290
use the open source project the portion

00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,250
of what you are using it for kind of

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,280
becomes open sourced

00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:56,070
like to get to keep that IP yeah is

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,200
there any inherent data sharing that

00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:00,510
just becomes applicable as part of using

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,430
that open source so it is reading that

00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,780
fine print and making sure that we

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,150
completely understand what we're getting

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,040
into yeah and I think maybe the simple

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,350
observation is sort of what is what is

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,150
your fundamental unfair advantage in

00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,530
terms of how you take advantage of this

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,420
open source project like at the end of

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,370
the day it is an open source project

00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,890
right so anyone can have a relationship

00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,240
is it like what is your role in the

00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,280
governance in the creation of the

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,040
product in your company's stature or

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,930
situation that's gonna actually allow

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,150
you to be one of the one to three

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:33,750
companies that can really draft off the

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,700
project and and you know I think it's

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,320
great for various consulting practices

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,880
and in other types of businesses to

00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,920
build a publicly traded company you have

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,780
to really articulate that and there's a

00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,580
lots of there's you know there's how

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,320
many kubernetes related companies do we

00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,320
actually need at the end of the day I

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,300
think there's room for one two three do

00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,850
we need do we need 30 kubernetes

00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,470
companies uh yeah I don't know yeah I

00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,760
mean it's hard to I mean certainly at

00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,680
least a couple those are gonna be really

00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,550
big is the point right that I think you

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,200
know this is the riding the coattails

00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,840
it's over I want to come back to this

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,490
register go ahead Gary I'll I would

00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,450
encourage everybody to be very creative

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:11,280
about how to monetize upstream so

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,690
certainly opens first gives you market

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,670
leadership you can start from nothing

00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,640
and become a market leader pretty

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:20,610
quickly and I think open source as a

00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,650
freemium business model and it has it

00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,180
also gives you a mindset of b2c which

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,980
you have to automate everything because

00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,990
you don't want people calling you

00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,370
because they aren't paying you so you

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,890
actually build up some pretty good

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,660
practices to make yourself operationally

00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,130
very efficient but then you got to

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,690
figure out how to monetize and I'll just

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,850
give you one example we have a

00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,030
co-investment with excel in a company

00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,160
called sona type it is the maven open

00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:47,040
source project for software build

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,930
management and it you know has all the

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,440
same issues of competing against the

00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:55,230
free version but we recruited in a CEO

00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,230
that used to be the CEO Sourcefire had a

00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:00,300
security background and he said hey all

00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,880
these components that are coming for the

00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,450
last panel all these components coming

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,110
in to

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,520
a company can be scanned and you can

00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,260
figure out what the pedigree is and what

00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,360
quality and the downtube also whether

00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,640
there's known security flaws we will

00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,280
create the equivalent of a component

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,070
firewall for large banks and retail

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,890
company isn't alike and and figure out

00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:25,980
what components are allowed in gold

00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,300
golden mastered and what servers what

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,100
applications they are throughout the

00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,360
whole organization and all of a sudden

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:36,540
now it is a runtime operational DevOps

00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,600
tech ops but also a CSO solution that

00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,390
took it from the twenty five KSP to six

00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,220
figure and some seven figure deals so

00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,130
who would have thought of monetizing it

00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,410
for security so think about your project

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,060
are there other ways you can add value

00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,340
to an organization based on the real

00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,350
estate you have in which with your

00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,970
product offering last question for the

00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:00,600
group and we just go down the line here

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,330
is consistently this week whether it was

00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:07,200
the Home Depot folks saying we like open

00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:11,760
source PS we're hiring the the theme I'm

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:15,930
hearing all week is talent is crucial

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:19,410
just this is such a big deal does this

00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:22,440
open source trend here is how critical

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,870
that is that to your talent strategy to

00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,640
bringing in and we did a little analysis

00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,640
of some open source projects it's sort

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,570
of in mid-flight right now where you

00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,210
know for a huge group of projects to 3%

00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,670
of the developers are doing 70 80

00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:41,010
percent of the code this is sort of you

00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,560
know your point these true innovators in

00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,210
there are really rare but how does this

00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,010
play into your your whole strategy or

00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,650
just open source move that needle yeah

00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,510
so before our server this project we had

00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,220
only packaged existing open source

00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,460
projects and delivered up as a SAS

00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:59,310
service but with a service project it

00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:02,250
was extremely well received and we had

00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,280
48 right now was 48 active contributors

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:07,320
10 of whom a 10 percent of whom five of

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,360
whom are now employees of platform 9 and

00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,340
these are the only employees of platform

00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,070
9 who are not based out of sunny well

00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,690
one is based out of Taiwan interests one

00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,690
is based out of Netherlands was a PhD

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,569
student doing

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:21,339
workflow composition and so really good

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,050
domain knowledge and expertise that's

00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:25,599
directly relevant to the project would

00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,410
have been impossible to hire but they

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,540
found us

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,030
there's no recruiting cars and so

00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,010
motivated so I think that it is a

00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,930
fundamentally different volume it come I

00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,520
think open source completely raises the

00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,319
bar in terms of the kind of talent you

00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,079
can attract their motivation to the

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,310
cause and the talent that capability yes

00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,500
you're saying big believers day

00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,810
interesting Eric are you seeing the same

00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,849
thing at yeah absolutely and in

00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,250
kubernetes too we also have a service

00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:53,230
project cublas and we've attracted quite

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,790
a bit of our talent through all of the

00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,010
open source projects that we have

00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,480
ongoing and also this commercial product

00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:03,010
is based on and runs on top of

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,630
kubernetes and like cerise we've started

00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,730
hiring people all over the world and

00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,770
somebody asked me like why have you gone

00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:11,079
into so many countries to hire people

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:13,329
where there aren't that many people who

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,579
are spectacularly good at kubernetes yet

00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:16,960
and it gives us a competitive advantage

00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,060
to be able to hire them wherever they

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,760
are when some companies want you in

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,920
office so absolutely yeah there are a

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,170
few of them in this room you know how

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,780
about you yeah so so for me again it's

00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,640
different I mean Boston so we have a lot

00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,260
of university but people that don't like

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,359
start-up they're much more kind of like

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,030
solid in the VMware Google of the world

00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:38,680
so for for me this is exactly what

00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,420
happened once we start open source of

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,650
projects and a talent come to us that

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,420
before that they were and feel

00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,910
comfortable to do that once the project

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,290
succeeds people want to come and it's

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,819
fantastic as I said I see a huge

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,339
advantage of being in Boston actually

00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:53,290
even doing because there is all those

00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:56,200
University and great people who just

00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,069
need to train I think I can give a

00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,140
little bit of the big company

00:47:57,069 --> 00:48:00,910
perspective on this which is certainly

00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,020
at VMware open source projects for one

00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,700
of our favorite ways to recruit because

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,079
you can actually identify people by

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,839
their work and you can find people who

00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:09,849
are specialists based on the actual work

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,109
that they've done and and we needed some

00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:12,819
people doing some pretty specialized

00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,920
things it was pretty hard to find and

00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:17,020
then you know Facebook I would say when

00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,670
even farther and you know as much as

00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,470
there were individuals within Facebook

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,910
who are absolutely passionate believers

00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,520
true believers and open source and had

00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,869
the desire to open source what they were

00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,880
working on and Facebook has contributed

00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,240
in many great projects to the world I

00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,650
have to say that the business

00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,720
motivation for Facebook to do it was

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,240
absolutely hands-down recruiting that

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,770
that in in releasing those projects we

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,420
were able to build our engineering brand

00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,550
we were able to attract people who would

00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,010
not have come to a company where the

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,200
only thing they would do was proprietary

00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,240
and so you know if you think about it

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,410
you know cassandra hive you know those

00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,330
projects are their existence to

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,930
facebook's bottomless desire to hire

00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,800
more engineers I'll take it

00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,270
jaqen want to go to you then rush me

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,040
I'll give you a last word I think all

00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,750
these comments are great I'd also point

00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,270
out like I think on the buy side there's

00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,460
also you know a huge desire a lot of

00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:07,730
people want to evolve their skillset

00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,560
they gravitate to you know working with

00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,810
open source projects and the vast

00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,160
majority the time that's positive you

00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,630
know maybe to say something a little in

00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,850
nassima and at some point some people

00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,290
maybe over rotate right and they're so

00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,550
enamored with open source they're like

00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,010
oh wait a minute like is this actually

00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,840
the best thing to solve my problems you

00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,760
know that's more the the exception than

00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,860
the rule but it creates this groundswell

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,770
of adoption and then the you know the

00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,790
fundamental outcome of that is to tie

00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:33,859
back something we talked about the

00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,750
beginning it's a you walk into the CIO

00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:37,400
after the the you know these open source

00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,840
projects are here and like of course I

00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,369
want to talk to you because you know

00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,680
it's already deployed all my engineers

00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:44,480
are telling me all about it what like

00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,609
the first time you you say hello to them

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,630
what proprietary software company like

00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,430
you're not going to see how this door

00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:51,830
and it's like go talk to someone three

00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,810
layers down right and so it has a

00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,740
tremendous benefit on on the buy side in

00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,840
terms of the interactions yeah

00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,090
absolutely rationally last word yeah for

00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,520
us as well I mean it's definitely the

00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,290
caliber of talent that we can attract as

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,140
part of recruiting so when we acquired

00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,660
as Gabe and his entire team stayed on

00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,369
board we got Brendan burns it was the

00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,050
chief architect of kubernetes to join us

00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:15,530
that was a big moment of celebration for

00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:17,420
everyone in house but keeping and

00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:20,480
retaining those people is incredibly

00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,980
important as well so I do agree that

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,590
it's great from a recruiting standpoint

00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,810
but I don't think that it would be cheap

00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,000
to continue to keep these people on

00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,170
board because obviously there's so many

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,490
interesting projects and so many

00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,650
interesting companies that they can go

00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,050
to and how do you motivate and retain

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,390
the set of people is going to be top of

00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,730
mind for any company bead startup or a

00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,980
big company that has these people yeah

00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,990
you heard it from rush me some of you in

00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,760
this room are greatly under estimating

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:51,410
your fair market value all right I want

to thank all of you for coming I really
