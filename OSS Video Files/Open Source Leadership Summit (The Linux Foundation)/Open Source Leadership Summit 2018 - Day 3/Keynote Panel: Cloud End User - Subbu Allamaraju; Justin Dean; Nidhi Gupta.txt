our next panel though is a group of

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,770
folks who are consuming all this open

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
source so probably have a good

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,360
perspective from hey we're bringing this

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,599
open source in we're using it to build

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,990
real systems and use in mission-critical

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,140
production work and really can provide

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,240
that different perspective not from a

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,670
supplier of open source but really from

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,390
large consumers of open source and I'd

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,980
like to invite the panelists up on stage

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,899
all I bring you all up and then

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,540
introduce you one by one but please come

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,040
on up

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:43,260
weird adjusting oh there it is all right

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,770
go ahead and have a seat so we have

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,910
subbu alum Raju VP of Technology at

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,280
Expedia so you lead Expedia's cloud

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,660
migration and enterprise data center on

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,050
the public cloud work that you're doing

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,050
that's a humongous job Nicci Gupta is

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,500
with the the SVP of technology at hired

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,260
how many people here know hired oh we

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,880
got to change that yeah it's like you're

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,860
changing open your guy yesterday's like

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,780
I we do like two-thirds of the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,090
healthcare financial transactions in the

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,710
US but we had terrible market

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,130
I think hired has better marketing on

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,350
front and then Justin Dean who works at

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,960
a company I believe most people know I

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,860
and end up hitting that refresh button

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
constantly on Ticketmaster to get good

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,750
tickets to to my favorite concerts but

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,970
welcome all of you so so you all clearly

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,110
are using open source as a Patrick

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,180
mentioned you know more and more

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,880
assistance or based on open source this

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,320
is sort of one but tell us about you

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,939
know what are some of the key open

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,270
source technologies that you're seeing

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,270
used in your stacks you know what what

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,549
are you bringing in these days to you

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,560
know move towards this sort of DevOps

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,880
movement and and so forth I eat and

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
maybe we'll start on that end just

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,320
because we always start on this side and

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,600
we'll come back yeah I mean Ticketmaster

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,729
at its core is you know we've been open

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,200
source since the beginning well I say

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,640
the beginning we're 41 year old company

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,680
which a lot of people don't realize but

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,269
the culture has been very

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,790
very very DIY we were founders built the

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,640
nucleus of ticketing engine you know in

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,599
1978 some of that software we still run

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,939
yes fortunately or unfortunately but you

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,760
know the culture has been very DIY so

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,189
that led into open-source naturally so

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,930
we use probably almost all of the

00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,049
projects out there in some way shape or

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,579
form but you know the the core of it in

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,359
my world and the technical operations

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,590
and our cloud and infrastructure spaces

00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:50,459
kubernetes and containers is all the

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,319
rage for the last two years ish and I

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,150
you know it's it's it's really changing

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,659
the the landscape for us because we're

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,139
using our container movement as a

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,200
catalyst to improve software across the

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,349
company you know in all aspects of it so

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,659
you know all of the gift all of the the

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,760
you know we're using these technologies

00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,629
that not just from a cloud computing

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,489
perspective but from a let's deep dive

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:21,449
into every one of our applications and

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:25,129
and do the work of cracking open the

00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:29,189
code and making it more modern and

00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:30,900
really up leveling on all all fronts in

00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,069
order to get it to run into a container

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,049
and then to get it to run into

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,489
kubernetes in a public cloud space it

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,549
has to be pretty good right it has to be

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,109
instrumented and all and so we're sort

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,540
of using it as the catalyst for an

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,549
entire movement yeah on top of the the

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,109
open source projects that are are you

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,239
know improving and becoming

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,169
enterprise-grade yeah it's a it seems

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,689
like you know trying to figure out what

00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:58,379
the right abstraction layers are to

00:03:54,689 --> 00:04:00,479
build these platforms so you know is VMs

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,099
as it passes it containers is you know

00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,859
which application framework I'm looking

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:08,639
seems like that is such a tricky thing

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,019
to figure out and you know you want it

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,030
to be maintain long-term you want to

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,259
sustainable you know what what are you

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,579
seeing you know what are those

00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,919
abstractions what are those platforms

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,599
what is that that you're deploying yeah

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,250
I mean I think our tactic so let me just

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,379
begin by introducing hired since most of

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,360
you don't know how

00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:28,090
actually even before that happy

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,490
International Women's Day everybody they

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,849
so hired is is an application that's

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,370
purely built on open source we have

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:39,800
we're not just a web application a

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,000
mobile application but in addition to

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,699
that we have a fairly sophisticated

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,250
machine learning algorithm that presents

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:50,569
job opportunities for highly skilled

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,310
tech workers as we've grown our

00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,650
infrastructure and as we've grown our

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,139
solution our tact is pretty much like

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,870
what Justin said it's about finding the

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,389
right tool for the right job we are

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,659
based in San Francisco highest you know

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,550
it's a very very costly market for a

00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:09,889
start-up that's getting off the ground

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,740
especially in this environment which is

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:15,380
so highly competitive we are very very

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,000
cognizant of our human cost and were

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,090
also very cognizant of our time to

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,490
market so because of that we don't have

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,580
the luxury we were not like born 40

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,409
years ago and the ecosystem was very

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,190
different I started my career at Bell

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:33,849
Labs where we had an NIH syndrome where

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,710
you know we had to invent everything

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:39,050
within the confines of Bell Labs and

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,569
that's completely and utterly changed so

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,759
for us our approach is not about

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:45,830
figuring out the different layers even

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,599
as we invested in machine learning and

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,509
figured out what algorithms we should be

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,930
using we first go seek those solutions

00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,509
if somebody solved them only and then we

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,360
enhance and build on top of them there

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:02,389
are very very few cases where we have to

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,090
sort of start from scratch if you will

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,159
so our primary motivation and driver and

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,130
making these decisions is around cost

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,870
and time to market interesting about it

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,880
Expedia what are you seeing what happens

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,190
I think I actually closed some of the

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,069
neediest comments on do-it-yourself was

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:22,099
open source I worked at before joining

00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,199
Expedia to lead for migration I was at

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,880
eBay building a base infrastructure

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,330
private road infrastructure for four

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,000
years and and we embraced open source in

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,180
fact we were at the time one of the

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,310
largest

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,830
successful stories of OpenStack adopters

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,300
to OpenStack at eBay and subsequently

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,580
team moved on to kubernetes and it's

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,389
open source docker missiles they were

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,150
all in gaining the culture and and we do

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:51,419
have similar mentality of embracing open

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,780
source being open sharing all that stuff

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:58,940
but what I see happening is that as

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,229
cloud has the service' fication of

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,500
problems has been growing very rapidly

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,509
in the last few years in setting from

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,460
2011-12 onwards until now your massive

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,479
warehouse scale services offering very

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,949
solving real interesting problems that

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,500
we were able not able to solve as

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,680
quickly in the data center so that has

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,500
changed from open source to a bit closed

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,599
source because I don't know how this

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,610
service called Kinesis works but it is

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,160
solving that problem right so that is

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,770
influencing how we are thinking about

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,180
this open source in in courts because we

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,130
have to take advantage of what exists

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,590
there so we can invest in our time and

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,419
money in where our business course yeah

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,760
so that's the chain I'm seeing or the

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,409
last solely yes I could actually won't

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,760
be supporting you yeah and we saw that

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:48,840
yesterday you know in the Cerberus

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,419
conversation this you know avoid lock-in

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,000
you know solves a super-fast problem

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,620
like I'd be curious to hear what what

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,419
did the three of you like where do you

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,310
land on this pendulum because I think

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,979
those are tough decisions because it's

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,710
so tempting to just say I gotta get to

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,180
market and just take that and then five

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:11,759
years later wow this is getting

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:15,870
expensive yeah from the Ticketmaster

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,930
perspective you know it's there's an

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,060
interesting dynamic that happens when

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,070
you you know at a large company with

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,669
lots of diversity of our product space

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,199
and different teams and you know in

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,849
different cycle like where they're at in

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,579
the maturity of their their particular

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,169
product that they're working on we have

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,000
a lot of aspirations like hey we're

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,589
gonna go and do whatever the thing is

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,229
right we're gonna be all kubernetes by

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,120
next year and then reality hits and then

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,820
you realize you know there's a there's

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,040
an entire spectrum of of these different

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,200
teams so

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,000
some of them take you know it all the

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,580
advantage of something new server

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,350
serverless technology and if they if it

00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,900
fits within if it helps them either by

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,690
speed agility or some reason deliver

00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,520
some business function and it's worth

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,370
doing that that's not in the vanilla

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,920
suite of sort of corporate offering type

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,720
of a thing then we encourage it you know

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,030
go do that because there's some ROI

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,680
that's important but we try to be eyes

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,020
wide open across the company that says

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,790
by doing that we not you know you may

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,270
not get centralized support on all these

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,040
things that are fairly you know we can't

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:30,930
support all Earth's technologies right

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,240
so but we've we've learned that you know

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,530
standard standardize on the things that

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,770
make you know the core bread-and-butter

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:40,140
things but definitely allow teams to

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,850
operate like mini micro businesses and

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,570
they have their own drivers and

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,270
motivations and being having an open

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,460
mind to that is you know it works really

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,140
well for us on the flip side it's

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,670
challenging a little bit because it's

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,100
easier when everything is one thing

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,020
right use this cloud and here's the

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,640
rules and here's the menu in an out

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,010
burger menu right it's just not super

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,920
practical for large scaled out companies

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:08,670
that have probably a diverse business

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,140
portfolio yeah yeah I think to the point

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,640
that specifically the lock-in point yeah

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,950
locking can happen regardless of whether

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:22,100
using open source of closed source right

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:24,540
so at some point if you hold back on

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,790
avoiding lock-in you're going to

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,860
sacrifice efficiency you're going to

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,600
sacrifice there's a cost component to it

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,400
and no matter how much you try to avoid

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,830
that lock-in even if you sacrifice

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,520
efficiency and you incur additional cost

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,760
you still will not be able to so my our

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,010
personal point of view is go all-in and

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,020
if you need to change down the road you

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,940
change down the road yeah can I make one

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,110
comment real quick sure I can comment so

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,790
I would I would since we did have a DIY

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,650
spirit like so we built our own cloud

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,029
ten years ago and like it's really

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,769
really

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,269
useful for developers it's easy to use

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,700
it all that I would argue that we've

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:09,040
built the most lock-in machine in our

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,149
private cloud that's really challenging

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,820
locked in you don't know you can

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,709
literally have to staff it you know so

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,290
it's it's challenging so it doesn't just

00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:21,149
go on the vendor side of things it's you

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,470
could lock into your own stuff I

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,050
couldn't agree more I think I think the

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,029
moment you pick something build some

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,940
tools around it build some operating

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,490
procedures around it and culture around

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,050
it you're locked into it whether that is

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,779
an open source software or a closed

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,579
source appliance or a cloud service a

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,089
lock and is here to stay it's part of

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:46,690
our it's actually a cultural artifact

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,250
because I do believe that the process of

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,610
Maine take that the act of maintaining

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,160
change I have the culture to yes we can

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,190
change anytime we need to change I think

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,170
that is much more important then but

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,300
then the feel driven mindset of okay I

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,639
don't want to embrace X product because

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,279
that X is close source I don't like that

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,070
vendor he might mess my things in future

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,449
that's fear driven approach I would

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,769
definitely not take that fear driven

00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:13,660
approach in fact instead I would look at

00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,459
the opportunities that exist for me for

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,350
my business for my customers and go

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,449
after those yeah and Interlaken is a

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,920
process I have to deal with it yeah yeah

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,050
it's funny because it you know I on

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Tuesday I kept saying like if the these

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,300
black and white like lock and versus not

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,519
lock in its past this now it's this

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,190
degree of subtlety of managing risk

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,230
somewhere on that spectrum which is what

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,399
you're all talking about net subtly

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,699
truly matters

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:43,029
yeah the what's interesting to me though

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:44,079
in terms of you three being here is you

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,480
know we have a lot of folks in the

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,209
audience that work at companies who

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
build commercial implementations of a

00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,630
lot of open-source right and that could

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,060
be intentional as a pure kind of open

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,829
source based startup or it could be just

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,449
because hey we got to get to market fast

00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,519
and our products just so happen to use a

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:03,490
lot of open source components to do that

00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,410
but and so they have program offices

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,240
they have people inside of the company

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,540
who manage the intellectual property

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,430
sharing that worked tool the development

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,860
process to pull code in modify

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:19,940
share back rules so on and so forth and

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,700
we hadn't seen that as much in you know

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,110
what you all represent which which not

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,330
necessarily you know you you obviously

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,940
have a service you're providing but we

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:32,209
think much more others end-user these

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,910
type of groups being formed what what in

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,350
each of your companies do you have like

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,089
the you know these policies are you

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,410
building compensate it's something to

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,360
build right into the engineering team

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,680
like how do you approach open source in

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,209
your firms yeah sort of so it's

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
interesting because it one of the first

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:53,149
things I noticed being here in talking

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,510
to people and on day one I I sort of had

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,010
a little bit of open source FOMO maybe

00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,810
you know it's like you know everyone has

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,110
these open source program offices and we

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,790
don't have that and part of me is you

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,589
know going and rationalizing like well

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,790
because in our DNA but then part of me

00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,459
is like we're probably missing the boat

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,980
a little bit on like doing it doctored

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:19,040
way but you know we we definitely

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,670
encourage in just the fabric of our

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,560
engineering culture obviously using open

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,830
source and but but contributing as well

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,080
yeah and part of it is we want the

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,060
highest caliber talent working at the

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,680
company and we want them to be happy and

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,000
excited about what they do and we want

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,459
them to be part of the open source

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,370
community and normally that's where we

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,010
find them and we recruit them so they're

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,660
naturally inclined to want to

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,020
participate in that and we support it in

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,580
every level that we can possibly do

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,770
everything from you know actually

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,660
committing to upstream projects you know

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,790
as well as supporting sending people

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,529
around and talking about stuff which you

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,360
know if you go back a few years ago you

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,070
wouldn't see a Ticketmaster standing on

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,570
stage talking about things that they're

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,100
doing right because it we're super

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,860
secretive and keep it all locked down

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,310
right so we're we're changing how we

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,260
think about the value we provide as a

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,579
company and it's not our secrets right

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,860
it's it's what we provide in the

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,050
platforms that we we offer yeah and it's

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,899
there's almost an infinite interesting

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,450
corollary as a company we're opening up

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,890
our platform meaning not the people who

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,769
own all the ticketing inventory but now

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,149
we're becoming a platform for a market

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,939
place essentially right so there's

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,980
almost this this company level

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:36,989
open-source mentality that's that's

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,989
happening and permeating so it's it

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:41,319
mistake away that I have from this week

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,239
is to really start investigating you

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,470
know we need an open-source office to to

00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,209
take advantage of some of the work that

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm seeing a lot of folks in the

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,360
audience do and put a little more

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,089
structure and rigor behind it because we

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,799
probably can increase our horsepower and

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,429
velocity and contribute more yeah

00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,100
interesting

00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:59,470
have a heart so some of the some of the

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,079
things we do in terms of adoption is so

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,049
are our application is built using Ruby

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,589
and rails so there's a there's a fairly

00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:10,660
large community of gems community

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,220
support around gems that's available so

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,040
for anything new that we're looking at

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,110
we we for scour to look for any gems

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,149
that we can just start in terms of

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,119
contributing back into the community

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,589
because so much I mean literally we

00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,420
could I could count on my fingertips of

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:29,079
things that are not open source in our

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,119
infrastructure so given that we sort of

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,059
make a conscious effort to contribute

00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:35,949
back into the pool some of the rigor and

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,670
process that we've introduced which has

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:43,179
been very interesting is as part of an

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:45,309
engineer's growth ladder one of the as

00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:48,209
they become as they grow in their career

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:50,019
they need to there's a leadership aspect

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,329
regardless of whether in the management

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,100
track or not as an IC there's a there's

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,319
a leadership aspect and there's a

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,139
community aspect and that community

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,749
aspect is giving back to the community

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:04,329
that you you've gained so much benefit

00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:06,399
from so that's been helping yeah I think

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,169
we take a similar approach in fact I was

00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,549
thinking we like Justin was thinking

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,850
like we don't have an office program

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:15,189
office but we are practicing learning we

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,809
are practicing sharing we encourage in

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,059
fact one of the norms we set for our

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,360
engineers like you had talked about is

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,189
that learning and sharing are part of

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,559
your your norms we expect each injury

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,510
engineer to adhere to right so you

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,440
cannot say I won't share I won't talk

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,760
your we expect you to do that as part of

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,799
exhibiting growth mindset taking

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,720
feedback from others and leveraging so

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,740
we have this question like where yes you

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,520
are doing this problem but are you

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,320
leveraging something that exists and

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,750
from Team we try to look for that to an

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,380
extent as long as it doesn't impede that

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,940
person's drive to do some things on his

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,800
own because there are teams that want to

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,420
do it and we don't stop that yeah

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,500
anything more important the leadership

00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:59,930
aspect is are you able to as you as you

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,640
grow as an engineer or individual are

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,740
you able to promote these behaviors

00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,230
learning and sharing and demonstrating

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,550
we do increase contributions or in open

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,680
source but we don't have a program

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,680
office as such and actually learning

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,840
from others and what how they approach

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,680
that problem yeah I mean because you

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,910
know the question I have is what I hear

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,160
a lot you know you heard this from Home

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,200
Depot yesterday right you know very

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,840
traditional company and I think they

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,690
said four or five times on stage in

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,460
their keynote a were hiring B we love

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,560
open source developers did we mention

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,030
we're hiring we love open source we're

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,680
hiring open source developers are

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,040
awesome right I mean clearly that is a

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,570
huge motivation to let your employees go

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,130
work in these communities because that's

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,350
what they want that motivates them that

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,960
helps you and so forth what what are

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,430
some of the the but then I talked to

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,790
let's say a financial services company

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:56,210
that I'll say whoa or not we're

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,710
regulated we're not sharing what are

00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,390
some of the road but can you give some

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,630
examples of road bumps that you've had

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,730
in terms of you know we don't we're not

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,250
quite sure how to share we have white

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,960
and black lists of licenses or we're not

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,220
we don't know how to pick projects what

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,800
are things that you struggle with that

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,410
maybe this community can help you with

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:20,660
so I can speak for us exactly the

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:23,180
example that you gave as we as we get

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,140
larger enterprises especially banks on

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:29,960
our platform they get scared they get

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,790
scared they ask for a disclosure on when

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,030
we get the info SEC requests you know

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,380
they ask about open source software and

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,180
you know sometimes they ask for us to

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,830
share the list of open source and you

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,060
know that this does really really

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,810
massive we actually do have a good risk

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,520
yes we use this tool we use this gem

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,440
thanks for the Ruby ecosystem that

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,470
actually discovers it and also actually

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,600
very easily just pick

00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:00,549
up as to what the licenses are but but

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,460
yeah it's it's a big challenge in terms

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,650
of not just educating our customers but

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,900
also their legal teams and their

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,730
security consultants that you know as to

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,650
the process but which we've gone through

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,770
in terms of through which we've gone

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,270
through in terms of evaluation we have

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,299
this constant conversation with our

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,909
legal right thankfully over the last

00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:25,419
several years legal is sort of catching

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:28,030
up so several years ago it was it was a

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,530
huge struggle in working with our legal

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,679
department but I think I think I think

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:36,450
the industry is catching up yeah I would

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:40,150
I would say we're in a similar boat that

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,669
the thing that I think I guess the

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,789
biggest unlock for us in that space was

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:49,539
is starting to educate the folks in the

00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:53,110
company hmm manage those risks like our

00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:55,150
legal our PR teams like those are the

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,610
two big big ones to get anything done or

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:01,750
approved and the closer they are to

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,429
understanding the value of being a

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,809
company that is embracing and adopting

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:09,120
and contributing back in an open source

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:11,789
community the more they can help enable

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,500
us to do things and approve things

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,400
versus just look at the risk side right

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,929
because there's there's not a lot of

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,610
upside when you send an email and say

00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,020
hey we're thinking about doing this

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,650
thing can you approve this and it's just

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,419
you know some legal doc they're their

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,059
default is no right why would I do this

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:30,039
hey it this is why we're doing this and

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,770
encouraging this and and then if you get

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:35,020
them connected to the financials of it

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,480
right like hey we're we're trying to

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,919
recruit just as a basic example right if

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,419
recruiting us a lot of money right and

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,030
we need top talent to do blah blah blah

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,830
so if you can somehow tie it to this is

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,539
super beneficial and important for us

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,110
and we need you to help us be an

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,340
advocate to sign the papers or you know

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,530
disclose you know whatever it needs

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,960
needs to happen so that it doesn't get

00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,429
stopped stopped stopped inside of like

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,070
email you know risk and or I don't

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,179
really know and you know definitely in

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,679
the I don't know I've had a lot of those

00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,940
it's something that should take two days

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,710
takes two months be

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,850
because no one's comfortable just

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,760
putting their name on it because they're

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,280
confused but some of you've been through

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,160
know generations of sort of you know

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,380
OpenStack the maze esta kubernetes and

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,270
and sort of what were the did you

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,760
experience similar road backs we're like

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,460
whoa we're gonna rebase our platform on

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,750
this thing and legal risk or like but

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,640
what challenges do you see going through

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,710
that problem we actually were fortunate

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,650
we did not go I did not go to the

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,630
roadblocks in terms of using open source

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,520
adopting open source and operating at a

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,260
larger scale because they actually

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,330
benefited a lot from that community and

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,160
we were able to scale introduced

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,410
tremendous financial and agility gains

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,320
for the companies so that was positive I

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,090
think the roadblocks are sort of subtle

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,620
doors locks that that I have seen in my

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,120
career in every company I worked for

00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,190
because not every engineer is willing to

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,530
stand up and say yes I have this small

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,140
contribution I want to make it tell me

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,390
how to do it oftentimes the there is a

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,460
red tense oh no I have to do this why do

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,470
I do this so that culture mind shift is

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,060
still happening has to have his teams

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,280
are going through that yeah I think

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,870
there's a lot more mentoring and this

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,000
package of growth mindset needs to

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,440
continue so that you are sharing and

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,720
you're encouraged to share you become

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,520
more comfortable sharing part of us it

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,280
will have the discomfort oh I need to

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,130
commit now it's part of my resume in is

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,990
it that they're too busy to say like I'm

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,970
you're already I'm already working so

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,560
much now I gotta go commit this thing to

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,300
a project and they're gonna give me a

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,490
hard time and they might not like my

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,560
code did you experience this a lot that

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,050
is that there is certainly some of that

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,550
because teams are in every company I

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,590
work for there's a lot more work to do

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,270
then a number of team the number of

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,360
people that have to do the water I think

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,340
that is by playing a pitiful so I've

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,190
seen unless you have a dedicated effort

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,960
to reward teams to increase the

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,090
practices show them how to do it

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,670
I don't think it's naturally going to

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,870
happen I'd love to get you're all three

00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,330
of your advice on you know one of the

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,220
things we said early on this week is how

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,700
do you how can you be a really good

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,770
upstream for this kind of downstream can

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,750
you know consumption and one thing I

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,070
just hear it is like panic and make it

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,350
hard for me to go

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,360
submit patches and you're put you

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,020
breaking us over the goals all the time

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,190
or it's an unclear process probably not

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,990
going to get that kind of it back and

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,039
starts to kind of deteriorate well what

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,419
are what are things you would advise

00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:37,690
upstream to do you know so one of the

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,640
things that's works really well is you

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,100
know when we when we started down our

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,039
kubernetes journey one of the things

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,730
that we did immediately was realized hey

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,910
we we do not have the you know talent

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,460
internally to really say that if we can

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,850
operate it at scale production grade so

00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:02,370
we partnered with core OS and through

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:05,110
that that partnership we've jointly

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,470
built things that were very specific to

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:11,110
in enterprise like so things like

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:13,090
detailed cost and charge back inside of

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,070
kubernetes itself right so things that

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,320
probably the upstream doesn't really

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,360
deal with but for me I have to build the

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,860
stuff back you know million internal

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,419
users so we work with their product

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,549
teams and we came up with hey there you

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:26,110
know sketched out what to build and then

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:27,970
we jointly build it and then they they

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,490
helped us push it back upstream those

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,090
sort of things yeah and it is they know

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,340
better you know how to get something

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,780
back upstream than we do or one of an

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,780
engineer who doesn't do that

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,299
professionally all the time but it was

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,400
just like this support harness that we

00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,440
you partner with with companies I have a

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,330
vested interest and it makes it easier

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,789
for us to jointly solve these problems

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,559
and and they take some of the friction

00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:59,110
out of it for us so I thought this is a

00:25:53,559 --> 00:26:00,549
really good example of how to take a

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,100
company whose we have all the problems

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,110
that that you know a lot of the

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,549
upstreams don't deal with so we have a

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,620
lot of knowledge and we can offer that

00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,570
and some hands on keyboard horsepower

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,730
and then they have the knowledge of how

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,500
to get it in scream yeah I mean it's

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,080
interesting because you you you know in

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,760
any user driven innovation cycle the the

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,960
end user requirements are you obviously

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,880
critical to this and you know a

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,770
developer you know may be working in

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,600
isolation isn't gonna see the scaling

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,580
problems and the you know that you gave

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,679
a billing example that you know you

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,100
would but what you're saying and I think

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,000
we all talk about is that having a

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,180
upstream that has a

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,100
support ecosystem of organizations that

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,020
can act as essentially commercial

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,270
intermediaries to that project is highly

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,100
valid bill do you look for that we don't

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:48,820
we don't necessarily look for commercial

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:51,520
intermediaries but we do look for we do

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,680
look for open-source software that's

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,840
well supported and has a community

00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,250
support behind it but does that support

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,320
it in a commercial sense and that like

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,560
others 10 vendors there or is it may or

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,950
may not okay so it depends so for really

00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,990
large pieces of infrastructure yes so

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,330
that's a backup option right we may or

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,860
may not call upon that commercial that

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,980
support infrastructure but we know that

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,350
that option exists but as it pertains to

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,880
smaller pieces of software like gems we

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,680
don't look for commercial support we

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,050
primarily look for look to make sure

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,510
that you know again time like time to

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,340
the previous conversation around

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,390
security and making sure malicious

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,030
software doesn't get into our

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:35,200
infrastructure is making sure there's a

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:38,110
history of changes there's a good a fair

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,550
bit of community support around there

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,200
around those gems and making sure that

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,960
this is not just something one developer

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,760
sitting somewhere has just shipped you

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,950
know there's like a there's a few people

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,920
who have been supporting it for a period

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,240
of time so it's hybrid for us yeah I

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,240
think going back to the question you

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,860
asked I think what I look for enough

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,630
stream based on my experience in

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,540
infrastructure open source projects like

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,420
kubernetes OpenStack mezzos I think in

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,390
the community we tend to underestimate

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,820
what it takes to run any software at

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,530
scale there is a service aspect there we

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,970
sort of miss in the in the way we

00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:21,400
architect and build systems I remember

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:23,620
very and I was doing an open stack the

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,270
number of con we had about 13 years I

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,010
remember I think the number of

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,130
contributions we made to upstream was

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:32,170
handful where our time was spent is in

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,370
actually operating the software at a

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,230
certain scale and we were increasing

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,240
scale systematically month after month

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,190
after month and that took a lot of work

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,350
I think we tend to underestimate what it

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,179
takes to run software yeah and and I

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,290
think operational operability is a

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,810
fairly complicated

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,640
and and that's where I feel that the

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,440
cloud is winning and open-source when

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,720
you compete on the same terms like the

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,550
same feature open-source versus a cloud

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,680
provider the cloud provider is winning

00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,030
because they're able to focus on

00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,590
automation automation and operability

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,630
much more than the community is able to

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,910
earn days that we have to consider that

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,130
a lot I do feel that it's time could

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,560
coming we are coming to a point where

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,820
the community probably needs to move up

00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,960
a bit on the stack

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,030
don't try to solve the same problems

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,850
don't let us fall kubernetes for the

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,800
cytosol infrastructure bonds move up

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,360
yeah then you can create more innovation

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,760
and let the providers operate the

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,500
service and they can add more value yeah

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,850
to us yeah I think one thing that's

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,650
always been interesting is that there's

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,030
this ethos of scratch your own itch

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,950
right like if you come to me with a

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,950
requirement as an open-source project

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,040
you better come with code right and I

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,570
think Greg Hartmann from the Linux

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,980
community and leanness and I have had

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,760
these conversations where you know years

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,650
ago I would say to them you know hey you

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,480
know these banks they're all using Linux

00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,810
and you know they're not getting the

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,010
common give code and scratched on it and

00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,410
surprisingly these guys saying back to

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,090
me we'll just take the requirements like

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,730
we're just not operating those

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,740
environments right we we really want to

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,020
understand and so it sounds like you

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,620
know just projects that have a healthier

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,660
way of at least just even hearing you

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:13,010
even if it's not directly with code it

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:16,850
is something that that you value there I

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:20,690
want to give a last word on the security

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,100
topic that that you just heard you know

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,980
this is something that I think we're

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,960
just all going to have to deal with and

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,730
live with and and improve and we're at

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,520
the beginning of a long journey of how

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,050
to fix that what what what is your

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,940
perspective on some of the concerns that

00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,860
Patrick raised which is you know oh my

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,660
gosh doesn't make it is this stuff more

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,390
or less secure and whatnot what word are

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,400
your perspectives I think I can touch

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,260
upon one point and I do agree with the

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,940
patek that a I think it's time to move

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,980
on from whether it's well multiplies

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,200
looking at the source versus propriety I

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,900
think what I'm seeing is a bigger bigger

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,120
challenge in corporations is that in the

00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,680
last 5-10 years we have sort of broken

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,110
the walls between Devon ops

00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,520
you know there's more feedback there's

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,890
more awareness of what happens in the

00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,360
site when things go wrong so that

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,770
feedback loop help the engineers to

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,190
build better systems that's happening

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,920
very healthy trend I see that but when

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,870
it comes to security it's not so because

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,400
teams don't understand what security is

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,230
doing and security sort of has this

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,140
glasshouse mentality we are now you

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,280
recover we tell you what not to do but

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,620
we don't tell you why we don't educate

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,110
you so there is that culture gap a lot

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,640
and and consequently teams don't make

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,400
mistakes because they don't understand

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,280
what that is collectors are I think that

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,660
there's a cop's a model where it's not

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,520
just about tools it's about the culture

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,950
how do you incorporate this mentality

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,900
into your your way of thinking any way

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,640
of doing so you're aware you make better

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,900
choices you teach each other yeah and

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:50,360
that's neat that needs to happen yeah

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:51,740
yeah sure so you know it's an

00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,930
interesting time for security for

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,490
everyone right because it's now in vogue

00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,770
it's now a topic it's now on the daily

00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,300
news like it's a thing like that more

00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,160
than it used to be even though it's you

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,110
know the landscape hasn't changed we're

00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:09,710
talking about it now and so you know

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:11,870
we're we are constantly re-evaluating

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,610
you know our practices procedures the

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:17,090
culture around security you know it

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,860
within the company I'm finding now it's

00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,660
a little easier to reevaluate because

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,930
usually reevaluate probably means spend

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,270
more money on it at some level but now

00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:28,310
the company it puts it as a number-one

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,380
priority and clearly right at the at the

00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,090
c-suite is security is number one

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,650
whatever we need to do to do it

00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,820
correctly

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,230
which makes it a lot easier right than

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,650
it was say two years ago

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,810
you know so that's giving us the

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:45,460
bandwidth and and the resources to

00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:48,440
really invest in in the tools the the

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:53,210
teams the put to bright policies and

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,740
procedures in place so it you know it's

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,410
it's a constant evolution I would say

00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:02,000
and you know where we border the the the

00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:05,180
different aspects of you know its

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,830
security is everyone's job but then do

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,020
you have people that are security in

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,250
their title and in balancing that right

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,389
so you have to have the security team

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,829
that has security and they're tied

00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:16,879
to enable and teach and get the

00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,899
requirements that you expect out of all

00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,389
of your engineers or all of your

00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,919
developers so that they know what to do

00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:24,679
and they know if they're winning or not

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,679
yeah so I would say you know for us it's

00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:31,039
just a constant focus of ensuring that

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,829
we're continuing to double down mmm I

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,629
think similar to what subbu said I

00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:37,309
hundred percent agree we've sort of

00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:40,669
broken down the walls between Davin

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,469
DevOps but performance and security are

00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:45,259
two categories that are still an

00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:47,599
afterthought right so we we had hired

00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:50,269
have a very sophisticated CRC the engine

00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,769
we don't have we hardly have any tech

00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:55,369
ops staff we hardly have we don't have

00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:57,559
any QA we've automated the heck out of

00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:00,139
our pipeline we're now starting

00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,809
conversations about not just

00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:05,659
functionality but also plugging in tools

00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:08,389
in the right places to make sure that in

00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,519
our CI CD pipeline were measuring for

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,649
performance and security today we

00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,849
evaluate it in production there are

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,200
third parties there's third party

00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:17,690
software that's running

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,700
that's evaluating it but you know to

00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,879
what patrick said we need to put that in

00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:26,359
place in our CI CD pipeline what I hear

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,599
is unanimous consensus here on dev SEC

00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:31,759
hops like I thought were just talking

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,659
about DevOps the other day that was a

00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:38,269
new thing already it's ruined one of the

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,669
dynamics around that right is is so I

00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:43,009
like to say that we DevOps hard over the

00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:45,109
last like three years or so and when

00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:47,480
we're delivering product the market did

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:50,329
crazy fast speeds compared to what we

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,149
used to be but we part of that evolution

00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:54,919
is putting control and autonomy out to

00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:57,049
the edges right to thousands of

00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,849
developers and then when you start the

00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:01,069
security conversation it's usually the

00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:03,049
mindset is what we need to centralize

00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:05,390
the control so it's like where is the

00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:06,769
control and and when you give autonomy

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,660
you have to give accountability

00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:10,460
responsibility with it you don't get

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,769
autonomy without those and that's where

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,150
the DevOps stuff got a little off the

00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:15,769
rails I think for most companies it's

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,470
here's the economy here's the autonomy

00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:20,450
without the rigor behind it all right so

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,859
next year we heard at all week I've been

00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,589
hearing security is everybody's

00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,950
responsibility dev SEC ops we have to

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,420
integrate

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,660
this in the process we have to have a

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,089
culture around this I mean next year

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,700
let's check in on how much progress

00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:36,619
we've made on actually doing that I

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,240
think that would be an interesting thing

00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,950
in retrospective for back nine

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,560
so I want to thank all of you for coming

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,380
and sharing your insights and let's give

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,360
them a quick round

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,360
