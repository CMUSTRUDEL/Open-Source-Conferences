so someone set out there you know

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,750
welcome to California but don't move

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,519
here

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,349
I'm a native San Franciscan and I have

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,360
to say it is great living here and I'm

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,750
encourage all of you to to consider the

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,609
bay area as a home all right so thanks

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,519
Jim's Emlyn Jim and I have worked

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,560
together and stayed in touch for about

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,160
20 years now we work together a covalent

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,349
as Jim mentioned Jim impressed me there

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,480
in his marketing capacity and he has

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,550
gone on to do wonderful things here at

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,210
the the Linux Foundation so I

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,719
congratulate Jim on all his success oh

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,079
you're right there

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,789
congratulations Jim okay so Patrick and

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,280
I have known each other for a number of

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,250
years when Patrick was the chief

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,940
security officer at Salesforce he

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,440
considered the fortified product suite

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,899
he goes back to McKesson as Jim

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,329
mentioned and and the Dropbox was your

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,489
last Marshall endeavor and now is a

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,280
venture capitalist at a firm called

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,369
clear sky I've escaped the seas oh we

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,869
love pain yes we we used to say in the

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,060
commercial side now you've gone to the

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,850
dark side you're an investment but it's

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,500
okay so Patrick and I worked on some

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,090
topics together that we think will be of

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,909
interest to all of you in the room so

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm going to act as the facilitator here

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,930
and I'm going to ask Patrick about our

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,210
first topic and this is the one we want

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,369
to start at a very high level and get

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,710
your views on the growing security risks

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,259
as individuals as corporations as a

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,360
nation I've even heard you use a

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,770
metaphor of a stealth bomber and all

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,710
that so I'm looking forward to hearing

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,150
that the hopefully we're not insulting

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,170
anybody in the audience here because

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,000
you're like living and breathing

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,920
security on the daily basis and it's

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,509
inescapable in the news but

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,280
fundamentally I think the game has

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,189
changed over the last several years in a

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,509
very visible way and yeah let me start

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,369
with this stealth bomber side so let's

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,500
let's talk about nation-state threats

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,329
and we see it in the news about North

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,610
Korea engaging in various hacking

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,799
activities we've heard about you know

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,990
the u.s. potentially collaborating with

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,910
Israel on the attacks against the

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,569
Iranian nuclear facilities which are

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,999
cyberattacks etc

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,069
but think about it you know it's like

00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,230
why is this so compelling why is cyber

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,060
as an attack vehicle so compelling and

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,879
I'd like to think of things in terms of

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,200
economics and currently you know if you

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,209
if you google how much does a b-2

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,769
stealth bomber cost it's about two

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,139
billion dollars per bomber I think it is

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,909
think about how many really smart

00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,680
developers you can hire stick in a room

00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:35,319
and basically say go hack something for

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,359
two billion dollars so in the grand

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,700
scheme of nation state budgets that are

00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:42,489
being spent in terms of military it

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,650
makes perfect sense and it also in a way

00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,079
I hate to say it is a democratizing

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,849
effect it doesn't take many really

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,980
really smart people to develop an

00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,919
offensive capability so even small

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,719
countries that don't have conventional

00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,969
resources they can't afford the b-2

00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,739
stealth bombers they surely can

00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,510
basically mentor a grow train and

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,219
develop kind of like cyber offensive

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,260
forces I hate to use the word cyber me I

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,579
was like old school guys don't like to

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,189
use it but it's it's so much in the

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,260
vocabulary nowadays so that's that's one

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,689
dynamic which is the the nation-state

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,000
side of the attack is very real we've

00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,069
seen it play out also with Russia and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,989
Ukraine X number of months ago attacking

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,509
the power grids and taking it down so

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,009
there is a very growing sense of

00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,019
paranoia here in the United States

00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:27,519
especially but globally as well on how

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,459
to deal with this kind of like the the

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,750
new reality of global cyber war god that

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:37,090
sounds scary but the challenges that we

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,319
face there are not just on the kind of

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,569
like the government side I think it

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,040
extends into people's lives as well and

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,859
having come from the healthcare world

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,549
sees oh Kaiser Permanente for a period

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,959
of time you'll learn that there is an

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,840
amazing amount of vulnerability and

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,799
opportunity to attack and to cause

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,909
damage not only to dollars and data you

00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,889
know it's like in the past I would say

00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:03,400
the impact of many of these attacks was

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,349
that you lose money or there's a privacy

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,299
issue and there's an uproar and people

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,310
get paid off or you could signed up for

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,109
like a three years of credit monitoring

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,349
and the world moves on I think that's

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,699
changing because the dependency on

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,639
devices whether it's medical devices or

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,919
IOT devices the consequences are

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,409
becoming physical consequences that are

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,220
not easy to compensate again if we

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,720
project into the

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,430
Cherno there's a lot written about this

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,350
with autonomous vehicles you know it's

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,970
like okay you know what are some of the

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,200
horror scenarios you can think about if

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,980
you have a compromised of autonomous

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,940
vehicles crashing etc with the

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,280
healthcare space you know we did some

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,890
tests even ten years ago we were able to

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,330
alter infusion pumps be other network

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,970
hack into them and deliver fatal

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:49,150
potentially fatal doses of medication

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,210
these are all life-changing scenarios

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,950
and what's really interesting is many of

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,170
these devices and systems underneath

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,000
they're actually powered by open source

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,760
software as they're being pushed into

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,530
the marketplace and as I'm still

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,150
monologuing you know I'll talk a little

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,770
bit about kind of like the Internet of

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,220
Things and kind of why it's concerning

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,530
to me and the best way to maybe frame it

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,080
is to put it in the context of a network

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,280
connected fridge which is kind of a I

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,200
don't know I consider to be a silly

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,350
device but let's assume you just bought

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,050
a network connected fridge and you think

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,390
about it as a refrigerator and ask

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,520
yourself how long do you expect this

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,880
refrigerator to be operational in your

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,080
house before you basically replace it

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,970
with something it's probably you know

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,710
like 10 15 years after that it gets too

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,900
grody and maybe you have an efficiency

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,160
problem or a refrigerant leak or

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,830
something like that you have to replace

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,960
it so a refrigerator is a durable good

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,890
that has a relatively long expected

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,390
lifetime from a consumer perspective but

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,680
if you look at the embedded component it

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,120
basically probably has a little

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,160
android-based tablet sitting in the

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,419
front and a few sensors inside but if

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,100
you look at the embedded compute

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,860
component that's built into that durable

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,330
good ask yourself which consumer

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,350
electronics company has actually

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,340
demonstrated their ability to maintain

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,710
technology designed for the consumer

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,080
market for more than a three years you

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,300
know we've created a disposable culture

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,640
around technology in the consumer space

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,070
and what happens when you don't maintain

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,660
something anymore and you know I I have

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,850
this principle I developed which is that

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,280
if you want to maintain a reasonable

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,229
security of a system you have to monitor

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,479
and maintain it for the duration that it

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,550
is connected to a network so as soon as

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,260
that as soon as that monitoring the

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,040
maintenance the patching stops which

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,050
should be a function of the

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,020
manufacturer you have a security problem

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,400
so you know what's happening I kind of

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,630
like to think I'm being a little too

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,030
alarmist that we're kind of driving to a

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,640
cliff we have a lot of saturation of

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,140
these low security quality IOT devices

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,510
that are gonna be sticking around in

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,840
people's homes and and in businesses for

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,280
maybe decades that are not going to be

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,180
maintained we know that the embedded

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,350
components are not going to be

00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,750
maintained so they will become

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,950
exploitable eventually good news is

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,980
there are a lot of vendors basically

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:07,340
fighting to play in that space of IOT

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,500
security and if we if we go back to the

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,500
to the nation-state though I think a lot

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,340
of a lot of the average consumer average

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,430
citizen thinks of nation-state attacks

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,730
as you know military against the grid

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,100
those kind of things but you have

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:28,340
nations like China 2.21

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,820
that the government and the commercial

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,430
sector work together in order to advance

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,610
the causes of the commercial sector so

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,430
the so the in the impact is not just do

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,760
we need to fear these nation-states in

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,610
terms of military defence protection but

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,650
it's also do we need to fear that well

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,810
it's been proven we need to fear them

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,960
around the economy as well well that's

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,180
been a huge issue and I remember shortly

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,800
you know if you remember the Aurora

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,110
attacks they were called and this is

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,790
when China compromised Google that was

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,380
at least for the tech sector that was a

00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,700
bit of a wake-up call that was a big

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,210
changing moment and I remember at

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,620
Salesforce it really drove security and

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,240
trust being the number one priority of

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,950
the company it drove an immense amount

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,170
of effort and focus which is this can't

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,580
happen to us especially in the cloud

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,470
business as a provider it's like

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,120
massively degrading trust of an event

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,790
like that happens so you know the

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,770
reality is that the the espionage

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,180
element of it it's probably more limited

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,620
in terms of the number of threat actors

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,780
that are out there but it's still very

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,910
clearly apparent in terms of economic

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,669
espionage but what we're also seeing is

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,800
clearly the more traditional espionage

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,200
against nation-states and if you read

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,150
the press this last week I believe

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,950
there's a bunch of evidence of Russians

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,210
having compromised German government

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,130
network so it's

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,960
the economics are too compelling not to

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,360
do this the systems are too vulnerable

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
and it's too cheap and easy to do it to

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,240
not do it

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,160
yeah for sure okay well let's let's

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,990
bring it down then to the topic that's

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,140
of interest to the room specifically

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,060
which is open source many say that the

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,399
debate between the closed source world

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,779
where there is some argue where there

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,089
are some that would argue that total

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,830
control an open source world where there

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,080
are many eyes you know this many eyes

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,610
debate what does this mean in terms of

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,190
security of open source who's

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,200
responsible how should the eventual

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,510
consumers of open source think about

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,060
security when they use open source

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,279
products I think there's been this

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,220
ongoing debate you know which is better

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,500
a closed source open source whatnot and

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know if it's settled yet and you

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,800
know maybe I want to poke you guys and

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
make you a little bit angry at me but I

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,120
don't think there's a lot of evidence

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,730
that the many eyes is actually working I

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,630
saw a report recently I read it I think

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,130
it was published by the Department

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,649
Homeland Security but they did an

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,050
analysis and they basically said that

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,120
yeah you know the open of the many eyes

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,920
is not as effective as we'd like to see

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,810
it and there is some benefit actually

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,790
having the obscurity of having a closed

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,220
source product and I think one of the

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,470
one of the events that illustrates this

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,180
is you know last year when we had the

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,860
vulnerabilities are on open SSL the

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,050
heartbleed vulnerabilities after as they

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,000
were called it's open source

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,010
there are hopefully many eyes looking at

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,470
this that was the theory but they

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,900
weren't so I think there's still a

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,190
challenge around and maybe we need to

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,450
move beyond the argument of which is

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,760
better we just need to figure out how do

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,830
we manage risk and both kind of like

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,830
both situations open source is here to

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,589
stay it's one now it's like a saline old

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,820
Linux is the new data center platform

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,320
every company I look at that's doing

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,920
some interesting networking product it's

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,500
based on x86 hardware with Linux running

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,380
on it so the the proprietary world is

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,750
shrinking in terms of kind of like core

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,339
especially so you know the question is

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,870
how do we live in this new world where

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,940
we know that there is a growing

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,550
dependency and open source software and

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,529
we know that kind of the the many is

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,670
that this is somehow self-regulating and

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,260
that smart people will look at it and

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,480
find vulnerabilities I think the

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,820
evidence is that it's not working as we

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,920
may

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,240
wanted it to work so we have to think

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,190
slightly differently about how do we

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,980
manage risk in this type of a world what

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,920
what about these open source projects

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,980
that are coming out now Facebook has as

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,440
some school has it's very hard thing I

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,020
mean there's security in terms of

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,340
securing the code of like other

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,140
open-source project and then they're

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,480
like open source security projects and

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,130
it's actually really cool to see many of

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,650
the large tech companies like Facebook

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,260
open sourcing say Facebook case--it's OS

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,000
query and I know that Netflix and number

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,860
other companies they're developing tool

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,270
sets internally and they look at these

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,060
and basically go you know we're building

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,650
security tools but they're not core to

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,180
our business so let's share those with

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,860
the broader community and then you see

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,540
uptake on those and then you see

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,400
commercialization such as I've seen

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,130
several companies now that have taken OS

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,690
query and wrapped it with manageability

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,520
components so that other industries that

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,840
aren't very heavy in terms of having

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,360
their own engineering teams can take

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,420
advantage of that so I I'm really

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,130
heartened by kind of the open sourcing

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,840
of security tools by very skilled

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,970
security teams security engineering

00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,710
teams the other issue though is I think

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,990
less addressed right now which is like

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,850
the actual integrity and the quality of

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,590
the code of all the other comic just

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,510
open-source projects as a whole and

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,840
reliable your ability to rely on them

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,940
well how do how do we if you think of it

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,130
the the company that Jim mentioned that

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,510
I was the CEO of called fortify was a

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:26,100
commercially build product to scan code

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,400
and look for vulnerabilities and then

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,050
provide ideas on remediation and such

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,180
and you know we would sell that

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,120
typically to commercial enterprises and

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,650
they could enforce rules you had to go

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,800
to training you had to use this tool

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:43,200
your output would be evaluated based on

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,600
what the tool told you about your code

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,480
the code could not go in production

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,580
until a certain level of security you

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
know what was achieved just like we've

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,810
always had a certain level of quality of

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,580
certain levels of performance but in

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,440
this open source world what what's the

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,390
responsibility of the developer then

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,750
when we get given that there isn't this

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,870
kind of a uber enforcement taking place

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,940
so it's responsibility and/or

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,209
measurement as well so is every

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,490
developer going to have the same

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:14,769
sense of responsibility do they do they

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,230
think about my code is going to end up

00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,850
as a module that's powering a battleship

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,189
and has national security implications

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,319
probably not so I think the question is

00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:26,319
how do we drive more visibility how do

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:28,119
we enable the organizations that are

00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,939
building on these open-source components

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,860
to have better visibility into the

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:34,929
quality and sustainability of that code

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,949
that's happening so love the concept of

00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,389
you know like source code

00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,290
vulnerabilities game there are all kinds

00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,939
of other things that can be done

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,189
including like dependency scanning of

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,809
libraries trying to see you know the

00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,889
distribution which ones are vulnerable

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:46,119
or not they're companies like source

00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,129
clear they're basically building

00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:50,079
businesses on this or Blackduck as well

00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,730
as moving in that direction that's all

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,649
really exciting the question is how do

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,709
we pull this together so that if you're

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,920
building an open-source application or

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,600
larger one that I'd almost like to say

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,579
basically it's like I have only used

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,860
components that have a Tier one trust

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,439
score of some kind and then back off and

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,809
look at some kind of composite metric on

00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,850
the components that say that is this

00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,439
actively being maintained in other words

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,939
do I see commits happening on a regular

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:17,740
basis has this gone through

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,389
vulnerability scanning then you'll have

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,910
we done a full dependency check on this

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,470
thing is there maybe a corporate sponsor

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,240
or somebody more accountable but you

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,529
know second I think there is an

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,449
opportunity for the open-source

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:32,290
community to really come together and

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:34,990
put some metrics kpi's other things

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,629
around these reusable components so that

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,350
the individuals and companies that are

00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,759
building on these libraries and tools

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,730
they can see basically there is more

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,980
transparency as to the trustworthiness

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:52,299
what about the what about these these

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:54,850
commercial attacks that are happening

00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:56,709
like ransomware and things like that

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,350
what are your thoughts there and how do

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:01,779
we how does the community respond to

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,449
those kind of attacks I'm gonna go back

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,240
to economics so it's it's about attack

00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,649
surface and ability to make money

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,179
ransomware under a Bitcoin are awesome

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,850
because you know you can completely

00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:14,920
disintermediate an entire very

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,499
complicated criminal supply chain and go

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,910
directly from compromised to profit you

00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,769
know so it's like it's a trend that

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,329
we're not going to see you reverse

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,279
itself I think we're going to continue

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,379
to see it both destructive

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,029
and also kind of these direct

00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,879
monetization attacks if you want to call

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,110
them ransomware related to tax how does

00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,959
that affect the open source community I

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,790
mean right now I would say prepare for

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,470
it because you know it's been targeting

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,269
the Windows desktop and end user

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,179
environments you know you go where the

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:45,309
money is but you know let's assume that

00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,689
some clever security companies and maybe

00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:48,970
Microsoft may figure out how do they

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,649
restrict that ability maybe it's at the

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,540
file system level so that you know you

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,389
have reversing capabilities that negate

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,279
this etc so if that happens the attacker

00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,379
is gonna shift elsewhere so you know

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,999
what's next and like I said earlier I

00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:03,369
you know I really think that especially

00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:05,259
Linux has one in the contemporary data

00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:06,550
center I mean even Kenmore what it is

00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:08,829
but a large percentage even the machines

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,439
running in Microsoft's Azure cloud or

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,389
Linux machines so it's like you're going

00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,249
to go where the money is and who knows

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,470
maybe they'll move upstream away from

00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:18,759
attacking the desktop and individual

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,350
end-users to attacking the

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,540
infrastructure holding it for ransom

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,059
so the accountability again of

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,889
open-source developers feels like well

00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:29,019
it's simpler ability it's like manage

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,550
your vulnerabilities but there's an old

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,620
adage which I think comes from Microsoft

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,089
which is if the bad guy can run his code

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,480
on your system it's not your system

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,120
anymore

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,589
so and it's like and the question of the

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,689
impact is really how creative the bad

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,759
guy is so we know ransomware is just

00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:44,379
kind of one instantiation of creativity

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,059
where like I said they've

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,589
disintermediated the criminal supply

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:51,339
chain have gone directly from compromise

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,529
to profit hmm interesting what we've

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:57,429
read in the news and we've heard about

00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:00,550
the specter and meltdown and just

00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:02,740
curious on what your views are of what

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,380
happened there how the response was the

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,370
the notification has been a little

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,140
controversial I think there a couple of

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,720
interesting trends here to look at I

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,669
mean one of them is there's a shift

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,429
towards more scrutiny at the hardware

00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,990
level which i think is good I'm glad

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,750
researchers are paying attention to this

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,279
and which is also causing more scrutiny

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,130
to the hardware manufacturers themselves

00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,990
and you know III don't have insight

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,790
knowledge in terms of how everything was

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,590
negotiated with Intel on

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,810
and the other chip manufacturers with

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,460
some of these vulnerabilities but

00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,560
clearly I think they're gonna be some

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,150
very interesting lessons learned because

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,830
it doesn't seem like there was a lot of

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,250
muscle memory there to make that a very

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,010
smooth process it's it's concerning that

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,100
certain open-source projects like open

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,170
BSD for example or very security focused

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,890
we're left out of that kind of like

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,780
negotiation ring kind of like the circle

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,580
of circle of trust basically which is

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,720
very interesting I think that needs to

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:08,590
be re-evaluated as well as again as an

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,660
outsider it looks like just the quality

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,950
of design I mean I've just basically put

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,200
a call out to the open source community

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,230
to view to hold themselves accountable

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,670
up opening metrics and KPIs in place but

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,340
I think maybe this will be a turning

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,140
point as well to look at the hardware

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,360
manufacturers because they have such an

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,460
amazing amount of power and impact to

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,250
the overall system security that maybe

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,600
drive a higher degree of transparency

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,120
into kind of what some of those risks

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,830
are and even into the into the process

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,340
that they're using for building some of

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:41,170
these kind of new chipsets the other

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,760
side of this is maybe less so on the

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,840
pure hardware side but there's something

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,730
in the middle that we're also seeing

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,990
which is maybe the attackers trending

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,330
towards firmware BIOS whatnot you know

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,830
like the UEFI BIOS is like if you look

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,960
at the BIOS from X number of years ago

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,160
it was this horrible little CLI not

00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,840
command-line interface but text

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,940
interface and nowadays you have these

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,070
rich graphical interfaces basically for

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,600
computer biases you've got a wonder for

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,340
how many lines of code are driving that

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,020
and what kind of attack surface is there

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,650
and what opportunities does that open up

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,950
and when I reflect back to my time as

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,510
being a CEO of large environments good

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,400
god I would not want to have to touch

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,960
the BIOS it was like the whole concept

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,140
of like proactively going up and

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,760
updating and patching bios's it's like

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,830
let's let's put our fingers in our ears

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,450
and Hum la la la so we don't have to

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,130
think about this because just managing

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,140
patches that the OS and the application

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,840
layer was tough enough but I think we're

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,000
slowly being forced into kind of like

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,350
expanding or a set of priorities to

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,150
focus more on the hardware as well

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,900
having knowledge around hardware layer

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,610
vulnerabilities having knowledge around

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,050
BIOS versions and what that what

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,210
opportunity those create and there's

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,040
there is evidence again that especially

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,950
at the nation state level that within

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,130
the supply chain in other places bios's

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,690
are being corrupted and if we kind of go

00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,070
back and I said that you know there is a

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,200
destructive element to some of these

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,660
attacks what better way of causing

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,250
damage than to just break systems by

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,710
corrupting the bios in a way that it

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,240
can't be recovered easily yeah we're

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,680
gonna we're gonna have time for a few

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,680
questions so if you think of something

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,600
you'd like to ask Patrick we have about

00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,220
nine minutes left I have a couple more

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,050
questions then we'll open up for a few

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,950
from the audience what one question I

00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,930
have that's off script sorry is there

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,180
are companies represented out here and

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,550
and you've had a ton of experience as a

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,370
CSO chief information security officer

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,950
how what advice would you give to a

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,500
company on just at you know at the

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,600
30,000 foot level of how do you think

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,890
about protection how do you think about

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,480
detection how do you think about

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:47,790
remediation in today's world so my

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,810
general bit of C Zoey advice is

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:53,250
prioritize everything a it's it's it's

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,650
like we talked about the attack surface

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,200
being almost unbounded almost infinite

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,640
basically that's kind of true so you do

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,530
have to really understand your business

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,080
risk and prioritize and be willing to

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,090
ignore stuff that just quite frankly

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,520
isn't that important and as part of that

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,780
prioritization can work with the

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,330
business so they understand and

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,100
basically say look here's what I'm gonna

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,810
be able to focus on and maybe risk that

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,340
can address and here's the rest of the

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,290
universe that we know about but we're

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,360
not gonna be able to work on for lack of

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,610
resources and other constraints so I

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,380
think having an honest conversation with

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,060
the business around priorities in the

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,240
risk management would be my number one

00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,890
bit of like seizo advice the other thing

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,930
in terms of maybe it'll be a little bit

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,330
more open source focused I'm really

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:41,130
excited around the whole depths a cops

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,510
movement which is you know I don't know

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,860
how much everybody knows here but

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,860
basically the whole concept of you know

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,930
the integrating security into the CI CD

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,760
pipeline it's not security being outside

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,290
of development and outside of operations

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,270
of pointing at the problems but being

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,060
part of the process both for software

00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,350
development operations

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,040
really exciting and I'm seeing companies

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,060
like gosh I'm blanking right now but

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,860
there are a number of companies that are

00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,390
basically creating enforcement along

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,160
that pipeline where you can integrate a

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,690
variety of tools a variety of checks

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,640
make sure everything passes before

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,930
anything is pushed make sure you look at

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,550
all the library dependencies that

00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,330
they're updated and then as everything

00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,560
is tested so there's there's there's

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,090
cyber that's the company I'm thinking of

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,500
and their number other ones as well so

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,080
they're said there's a good movement

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,040
going on that's trying to make that's

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,730
trying to create a sense of

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,290
sustainability especially on development

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,600
on top of open source system using kind

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:36,410
of these dev suck-ups philosophies and

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,360
my last question is that it concerns all

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,360
of us in this room as individuals is

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,110
what do you do to protect yourself what

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,300
can we learn from that number one thing

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,550
you can do as an individual is use

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,500
two-factor authentication I'm a huge fan

00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,270
of you bikies okay thank you for the

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,740
applause now seriously if you look at

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,870
the data it's like what are what do

00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,540
individual compromises come down to it's

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,310
not crazy zero day nation-state attacks

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,420
you know it's not like ninjas coming in

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,900
and trying to kill you in the middle of

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,110
the night

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,420
it's simple stupidity of reusing the

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,040
same password across multiple sites now

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,870
one of those sites happens to get hacked

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,180
and the bad guys then test that password

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,430
they have access to across all the other

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,020
known web sites and you know we saw a

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,000
lot of evidence of this testing activity

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,090
it's always going on and then they have

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,620
access to your accounts so I'm not even

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,030
telling you smart passwords just turn on

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,710
two factor authentication wherever you

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,260
can and for those sites that don't

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,780
support it make sure you use really

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,400
solid random passwords and I personally

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,960
use a tool called LastPass which

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,850
generates them and manages them and

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,530
pushes them into browsers and you can

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,790
also argue that's a risk in itself but

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,810
that's a risk I'm willing to take when I

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,730
combine it with two-factor

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,130
authentication that's number one piece

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,800
of consumer advice use two-factor great

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:53,620
I used LastPass too and said do we have

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,620
any questions mr. Sammon yeah

00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,040
your neck I'm gonna hog these questions

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,810
no I just have one question because you

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,600
keyed in on something and keep in mind

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,980
that we talked about this idea of open

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,010
source projects that are then

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,660
productized and you know companies will

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,100
then sell those and create valley and

00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,910
then reinvest back into these projects a

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,770
lot of people here are in charge of

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,650
productizing open source and in that

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,810
supply chain there indemnifying they're

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,870
taking responsibility but now you're

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,490
saying well hey that upstream has to

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,840
take responsibility too and there's some

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,100
people in here who are in those upstream

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,440
projects that might counter argue and

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,590
say hey the license is pretty clear here

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,360
as is no water to you right and it and

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,890
it sounds like you know Martin Miko's

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,450
was here from hacker 1 on Tuesday and

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,070
you know was saying it's everyone's

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,290
responsibility it sounds like we've

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,860
moved from sort of the law which is as

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:52,910
is no warranty into this social norm of

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,100
listen we are all in a pretty bad spot

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,860
what can folks who are in industry here

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,230
productizing open source do to kind of

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,210
help these upstream projects be aware of

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,880
this responsibility provide incentives

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,180
for them to do this to kind of help them

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,970
in in that that wall what ideas you have

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,820
around that Wow incentivizing them you

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:18,240
want to take that one well to me the

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,570
irony of that whole situation is if

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,030
you're developing an open-source

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:27,840
component you're very prideful that it

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:30,300
works right you you are very focused on

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,310
functionality and the reality is in

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,760
today's world functionality and

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:38,100
performance have to be have to go side

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,770
by side with security so it's it's

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,380
almost like you can incentivize but it's

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,100
almost like you there has to be this

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:50,430
mind shift that it doesn't work if it's

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,350
not secure that's right it can do what

00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,510
it's designed to do over and over again

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,880
but if someone can hack into it and and

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,160
and take advantage of it then it doesn't

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,160
work and that's to me that's the irony

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,680
of this situation it security it doesn't

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,330
work unless it's secure I think my

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,680
comment was step one before I even think

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,790
about incentives is just having

00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,490
knowledge so

00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,040
now looking at that dependency tree

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,540
that's they're looking and whether there

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,059
are old versions or libraries that are

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,309
embedded you know we as a venture firm

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,500
we know we do analysis of source trees

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,240
as part of diligence and we even find

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,980
security companies like why are you

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,200
running an old version of this library

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,570
you know it's just like the the in some

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,070
cases the the muscle memory if you want

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,860
to call it or the process maturity

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,270
around maintaining currency and going

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,910
back into all of these different open

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,290
source projects it just isn't there and

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,520
the tool set may not be there to enable

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,070
them to do that and that's why I was

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,390
saying I'm actually really enthusiastic

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,620
about what I'm seeing with dev psych ops

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,870
where it's changing some of that

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,429
dynamics so you have continuous updates

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:57,660
of a better components and visibility

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:59,700
into the risks Jeff boric with IBM

00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,490
thanks for being here follow up on your

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,290
point about the I don't want to say you

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,350
characterized it as a myth but the old

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:11,070
convention that many eyes on open-source

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,780
make for a secure ecosystem can you pull

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,790
the thread on that just a bit more get

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,429
to the next level of detail do you feel

00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,260
that's because it's just ultimately the

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:22,049
amount of volume of open source that's

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:25,169
creating a problem that many eyes can't

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:27,510
keep up with the question is who are

00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:29,040
those many eyes so are there I mean

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,750
they're obviously like project zero at

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,669
Google where people are looking at very

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,600
significant open source projects and

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:35,010
them you know they're basically saying

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,470
this is good for Humanity we're gonna

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,900
invest in that which is phenomenal but I

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,370
would say let's maybe up level it and

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,040
one of the biggest challenges in the

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,450
security world right now is that there

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,429
really aren't enough skilled qualified

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,470
individuals especially within the space

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,880
of application security and those that

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,410
are there especially in the Bay Area are

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,600
highly compensated by companies that

00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,910
they work for so you know it's like if

00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,169
we peel this many eyes argument back I

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:03,780
would ask who has the skills to look at

00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:06,720
and analyze in depth and verify and find

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,520
bugs in open source products and then

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,200
who's incentive to do so who actually

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,150
does it and it's probably a relatively

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,400
small and like think about it Venn

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,470
diagram a small group of individuals so

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,520
I do think there is maybe you know we

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,080
can take the lead that Google has

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,720
basically I think industry that is

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,509
relying and building an open-source

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,919
maybe they have to create some

00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,079
economic incentives to take these

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,029
individuals because it does come down to

00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,979
that and tools like mortify basically

00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:32,409
and basically say hey you know it's like

00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:34,209
our contribution and maybe iBM has a

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,979
role to play in that our contribution to

00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:37,719
the open-source community is to actually

00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:40,209
pay for people to look at this and

00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:42,479
clearly it's maybe not everything in the

00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:46,209
open-source universe maybe it's the most

00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:47,679
core projects the most the ones that

00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,659
everybody relies on again you can do the

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,009
dependency analyses and identify kind of

00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,509
what those are that are actually being

00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,919
used and you can apply some science to

00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:59,729
figure out where you put your resources

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,729
but in my mind I think that's the call

00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:05,979
one more question

00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:08,319
oh hi I'd like to follow up on that you

00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:11,469
mentioned earlier that you thought there

00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,149
was some advantage to obscurity in

00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:16,989
security I'd like to take issue with

00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:19,179
that mainly because of one of the things

00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:21,129
you just said which was when you were

00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:23,379
doing due diligence one of the things

00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:25,379
you did was analyze the source code if

00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:29,229
you're using proprietary components

00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:31,569
there's no way to do that so I agree

00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:33,249
with you about the many eyes people only

00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,259
look at your code if they're interested

00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,749
or if they're trying to break it nobody

00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:41,409
you know volunteers to go and secure to

00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:43,589
review something but given open-source

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,589
components

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,270
what that means is that they have an

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,210
advantage in that people who do have

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:56,010
security tools and who want to examine

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:58,200
the code for flaws can do so and the

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,090
security tools I'm hoping again in

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,650
better and better my big hope is that

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,950
the intersection of machine learning

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,290
with vulnerability analysis will

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,600
actually create a massive automated

00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,130
scanning machine that will that will

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,450
find the vulnerabilities before the bad

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,300
guys or probably the bad guys are

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,660
already doing this but I think

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,940
proprietary components simply can't take

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,950
advantage of that the only way you can

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,020
get to take advantage of that I think I

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,190
was very careful my wording to not step

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,830
in the middle of this debate and get

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,540
stabbed on the way out it was that DHS

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,480
report that made that statement that

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,550
conclusion now this has been a long

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,010
ongoing battle and both sides I think a

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,630
very valid points but again for you know

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,520
for what it's worth from an attackers

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,830
perspective it's maybe slightly more

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,660
difficult for me to attach to a binary

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,340
and tried to find vulnerabilities and do

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,809
blackbox testing than if I had open

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,059
source that did have tests against but

00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,620
so it's it's again I'm not gonna step in

00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,300
the middle of this debate that's why I

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,580
reference kind of the the external

00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,320
report on that and I also said basically

00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,640
regardless of where the reality is I

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
don't know if it necessarily matters

00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,570
it's just the open source community has

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,120
to look towards itself to how do we

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,770
improve the quality overall all right

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,730
thank you very much Patrick thank you

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:14,849
all for your attention

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,849
