good morning everyone a little irritated

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,390
to the people who aren't in this room I

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,390
think there was some drinking last night

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,860
so we're you know in wine country so

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,540
we'll forgive a little bit of drinking

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,949
but for God's sakes the moderation

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,230
please people so just as a way to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,289
penalize everyone next year we're gonna

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,699
change the venue but don't worry it's

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,420
still equally nice we're going down to

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,809
Half Moon Bay next year I heard there's

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,059
some shoutouts there yeah so one of our

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,920
staff on the amazing event team thanked

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,920
Angela back there and her whole crew

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,750
formal I believe formally worked down

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,120
there at the ritz-carlton and so we have

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,800
achieved an amazing rate and we'll be

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,899
down in the ritz-carlton Half Moon Bay

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,850
