so then what why do people that jars

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,220
good workshops always get bored don't

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,910
care because the instructor keeps of

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,910
babbling on

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,930
hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,410
episode of Jack adventure my name is

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,509
Jack and this is Ben yo hey it's been a

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,310
while but we're back today so I'm going

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,840
to be talking a bit about how we first

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,550
got into the web and JavaScript

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,769
specifically and then talk about how

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,660
we've been teaching it I think both has

00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,850
to be doing farewell workshop type

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,949
things recently you just want to kind of

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,739
mull over some force from those I guess

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,690
yeah yeah some start then how did you

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,370
even get into the web okay because we're

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,190
talked about this earlier and like so I

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,860
think I can I got in late so the first

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,180
website ever made was for my skateboard

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,219
I had like that's gonna yellow

00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,070
skateboard there a website for and it

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,309
was like it was terrible but it was it

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,199
was quite I had done a quick fun and I

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,640
think just be able to like the openness

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,149
of man just have something together and

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,300
get it online contributor geocities nice

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:13,070
yea ye what was your first I had to

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,350
build a website for my football team

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,530
okay good my dad and I actually built it

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,899
to glaze yeah so we bought a car around

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,030
HTML book and i'm rachel andrews CSS an

00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,369
apology but cool side for one which is

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,020
excellent and has been updated and its

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,819
really really good and yeah we just

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,009
built it I think we did use we didn't

00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,080
even use tables and we went straight

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,239
onto floats took us a little time pretty

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,679
sure we had comic sans and there the air

00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,020
but website to show all the scores from

00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,390
our for our football team solid and

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,319
never angry yeah so I guess one of the

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,289
things we're talked about earlier as

00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,720
well was about like we were both fans

00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,880
jquery and still bands right like um I

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,649
think so that was something that could

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,420
have helped us both along right like

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,700
yeah you gave a talk about that render

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,580
yeah good teachers cool thanks so much

00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,280
and yeah I think that to me the thing

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,970
that's important about that is the

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,099
accessibility of the web right like

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,879
making it easy just going to get started

00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:09,679
and made people not feel intimidated by

00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,170
it not generally went really far to do

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,090
that yeah i think my first exposure was

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,190
copying and pasting about cone's it did

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,319
like an accordion or a carousel or

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,260
something dreadful that Mia you know one

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,940
of those things I think JP gets a lot of

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,260
stick for making people be able to write

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,239
bad code already

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,700
efficient code in particular but

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,349
actually the way I would never been out

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,510
to write that code in regular JavaScript

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:34,489
at that time without being very much put

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,519
off I favorite and struggling with it

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,950
and i think jay jay is a perfectly valid

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,480
entry into the world of javascript and

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,549
what I did after that I think what you

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,170
did as well was go back a bit and kind

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,760
of step back and then I didn't know

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,959
about what's going on under the hood or

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,659
such yeah and I guess another thing

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,690
coming so I think we both got quite a

00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,260
lot from blogging as well right yes so

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,959
usually particularly you've got a

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,079
JavaScript playground yes yeah and I

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,629
have about 500 other blogs before yeah

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,340
my first upload was a CSS blog birthday

00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,129
yeah I think it would might have even

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,620
been called CSS wizardry before Harry

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,780
Roberts had CSS was a dream or maybe it

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,280
was something like that sometime soon no

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,269
it sounds like you know he probably had

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,970
at the same time that is way more

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,379
willing to learn good girl yeah I found

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,970
just writing about stuff a really

00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,769
valuable way to get thoughts down and

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,609
kind of clarified what would I fall

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:34,129
about it what was your first block oh so

00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,560
I think the first one that can

00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,329
contribute to go to I'm not had as many

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,049
as you but I had like be fox or walk on

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,669
and it was just like this random little

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,049
bits and pieces of things I was having

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,480
on but why found really useful ways like

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,010
I'm notoriously bad from not finishing

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,720
projects and stuff like that where is

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,720
having a blog gave me somewhere to kind

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,889
of output it yeah and I think to me like

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,560
possibly like github repos are my new

00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,239
blog thank you know it's like yeah and

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,060
so I kind of create I create one this

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:12,500
morning yeah there's no treated quite a

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:17,530
lot oh we're sounds like that we got out

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,530
right all right I

00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:24,150
so I think we've both been involved in

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,840
teaching other people out here to kind

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,940
of program stuff aware yes things so and

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,020
so you were holding some react workshops

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,759
earlier theory yes yeah so I did a few

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,910
times actually I did a couple Wyatt over

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,830
in London and then one at Scotland j/s

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,030
and somewhere else is what I thinks I've

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,550
done about three or four kind of day

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,560
long react workshops now which has been

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,120
really good I really if anything

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,310
actually prefer doing workshops to a

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,500
talk unlike having 20 or so people for

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,270
our old days it's very different

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,979
a bit more rewarding and kind of half

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,650
hour I'm a couple hundred people's

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,210
attention let's be really good as to be

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,039
really interesting to see how people

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,009
learn what areas people struggle with

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,660
and also dealing with like the tooling

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,789
around react and teaching that and

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,009
seeing how that gets in the way or not I

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,930
think there's a lot of people who think

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,250
that maybe tools are a big issue and

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,660
they are in some ways but it's really

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,160
sign see people kind of pick up these

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,050
tools and actually they're not half as

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,289
bad as the stick they sometimes get yeah

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,849
yeah yeah it's really enjoyable when I

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,099
learn a lot from it as well and how I

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,199
can teach things better react i'm just

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:32,099
generally kind of JavaScript and the

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,139
rest as well cool cool ya know nice yeah

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,580
I think I've ever going to believe like

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,789
you no longer need to say good things

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,199
yeah yes all good um yeah thanks and so

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,110
yes oh and also usually like tons of

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,669
talks over the last yeah like yeah it's

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,820
I think it's always interesting like

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,919
writing a talk to try and focus on

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,300
getting people to get as much as out of

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,520
it as possible and say it's really hard

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,659
to kind of bring everyone along at the

00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,070
same pace or something like that right

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,720
like which I guess probably more with an

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,729
issue with the workshop right yeah I

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,050
think with a workshop you have to be

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,639
much clearer ahead of time what the

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,380
requirements are for someone to get the

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,270
most out of it there will always be

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,620
people who a bit slower a bit they

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,490
quicker what I found really nice

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,680
actually at all

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,539
I've done is people have kind of helped

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,340
each other out along the way so that

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,660
that's from the best things if someone's

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,910
stuck and I may be helping someone else

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,440
or whatever often I'll come back and

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,030
someone's gone and I'd like better help

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,099
you a bit again I'm going to go so

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,780
usually like there's a sense of the in

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,460
the room that everyone is helping each

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,160
other out as well which is been really

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,990
nice to see so a big fan of the work my

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,599
workshops tend to be not be talking all

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,060
day because that ball me as much as very

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,580
much for the attendees than a clear I

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,979
mean you're bored right yeah I'm good

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,539
more words than I so I tend to like

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,250
maybe a bit of talking then have a

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,810
couple of exercises or challenges than

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,400
to do and rent a repeat after out of the

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,780
day so that's I found that very nice to

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,430
keep them and kind of hands-on engaged

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,530
talking or in laptops and then everyone

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,360
kind of often some will get stuck on a

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,949
problem i'll ask a question relates to

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
that and from their own leaders like a

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,699
half hour tangent on that particular

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,050
thing is almost the most valuable bits

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,960
the workshop chunky bits that happen

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,639
kind of the blue cool yep something

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
that's going all guys like ever done

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,650
know what's cool then or anything no so

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,229
I'm there what's really nice is you get

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,150
these set of ten tasks that you've got

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,130
to do to like achieve a particular to

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,860
learn about particular kind of text it

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,979
might be using express or might be using

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,050
kind of reactors on like that and you go

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,789
through each one a dragon-like workout

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,259
you can skip them if you want but in a

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,820
group it works really well because if

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,199
anyone's stopping a particular one than

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,639
other people who have done it they can

00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,110
go and help people going to do it at

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,740
their own pace and stuff like that yeah

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,509
it works really well as a no that's nice

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,580
we've held a few times in jayhawks right

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,370
and it's kind of just run itself it's

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,530
quite nice awesome yeah and you've been

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,560
doing a fair amount of JavaScript ting

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,960
as well yes yes in a sudden some tent in

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,889
a field yeah I wasn't a fan of yours

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,440
yeah and so yeah this weekend I was a

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,969
EMF electromagnetic field and I gave my

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,669
first ever proper workshop that I'd

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:08,069
written myself which was a little bit

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,490
shaky but I was using a new tool odd

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:15,030
written which is this I'm calling a co

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,219
je s for like collaborative Jes and it's

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,789
kind of like an in-browser editor that

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,249
you can cast to other people and we're

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,549
let you do is

00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:27,019
you can describe you can go through

00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:28,489
court example taking it and everyone can

00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,859
be watching long enough computer and

00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,120
it's like it's quite early days like

00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:34,069
I've been writing over the last couple

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,659
weeks but it's kind of cool like it is

00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:37,939
gonna it creates quite a nice

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,219
environment for people to kind of share

00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:42,560
their cold and working from rings and

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,319
stuff yeah so because I think thing I

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,560
find this thing i really i really dig

00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:50,870
talks they're awesome size wise that you

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,060
you can go to talk and like listen to

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,019
half an hour you've learned quite a lot

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,850
workshops are super cool we need to be

00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,889
there in our entire game I feel like

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,829
this is going to taking part of workshop

00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,689
style of seeing cold and playing with it

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,829
but cramming it into a smear amount of

00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,629
time so you don't have to kind of

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:07,790
worried about getting any tools and

00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,990
still order yeah so that's something

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,079
that I've been doing and so the tool

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,000
it's just an editor with an iframe feels

00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,089
doesn't like cold translation of stuff

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,670
is again using be playing roll up nice

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:24,589
your fans or you're so hip see oh yeah

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,600
yeah that's been yeah we were talking a

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,699
little while ago about tools and stuff

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,500
yeah and workshops so yeah without fail

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:32,420
every workshop I've done there will be

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,639
someone for whatever reason on whatever

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,990
laptop like not even like just old

00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,470
windows machines all sorts of devices

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,720
he's like no Jess will fail like how

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,970
won't work or some incredibly obscure

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,610
reason and that's the worst actually

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,170
because like really I don't know what to

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,850
do to fix those other than a few very

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,879
common areas all I'm going to do is is

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,740
google them and so so that often I've

00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,910
actually learning at all which I tried

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,079
our one of the workshops which I would

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,129
use in the future which is the same

00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,809
sounds pretty similar to your

00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:03,319
collaboration thing that is a react

00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:04,610
editor so people go to a website and

00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,709
they have an answer on the left and a

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,959
kind of view port if you like on the

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,250
right hand side the beauty of this is

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,959
they don't set up any of the tooling

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,649
around react and either like Babel to do

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:17,420
Jess X webpack to bundle together or and

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,879
hem to install things know that it's

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,840
also about balancing the browser they

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,120
write code they just have to define it

00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,550
was a name and it will magically get

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,140
rendered to to the browser and let them

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,550
see it and because it's all with a

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,320
browser they can pick up the react dev

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,450
tools instead inspected it and all the

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,680
rest of it but it I found that to be

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,990
really nice to just get people started

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,520
and it I use that for the beginning the

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,460
workshops will come in for the laptop

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,930
down go to URL and be straight in with

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,850
the the exercises and this kind of

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,890
lessons and stuff to guide you through I

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,600
think sometimes if people go and sit

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,460
down and have to clone a repo or unlike

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,940
any own story cetera that can often be a

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,630
bit of a kind of like momentum killer

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,070
particularly when something goes wrong

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,300
and then everyone else is ready to start

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,970
on one person is struggling because

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,620
their computers not playing ball so I

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:11,340
find interest how we both kind of ended

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:14,670
up on this yeah yes go through and you

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,170
want all my tears 2015 yes oh yeah this

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,910
is our other discussion that's the basic

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,220
about the show if you take this fast I

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,170
don't leave the office yo put them in

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,090
front of the camera so another

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,570
discussion yet Tommy doesn't we never

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,180
had this is good ok cool so how do you

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,920
feel about yes 2015 vary from learning

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,670
ballast games like well interesting

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,620
question yeah yeah so I really like it

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,960
is 2015 and like nearly all of the

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,010
features it provides I think we've

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,510
learned a lot from the way it was

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,310
released and so on and now again so much

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,590
smaller races we could card I think in a

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,240
previous Jeff adventure but think there

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,340
is a danger that some of the new

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,020
features are really good but not

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,720
necessarily is easy for beginners to

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,220
pick up upon I think very easy example

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,050
is an error functions are very concise

00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,460
which is great if you are comfortable

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,430
with them I think for a beginner they

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,950
can these encode that looks scarier than

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,560
it than it actually is in reality so I

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,970
think we need to actually if someone

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,380
came to me right now as I can complete

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,620
JavaScript beginner on everything had to

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,440
cover any es2015 not a single bit of it

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,000
oh yeah I as as you might've discuss

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,360
before I agree with that entirely I

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,010
think because I mean error functions are

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,170
cool when you know the problems with

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,750
this binding yeah you know Ennis but

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,180
then I think looking at them afresh it

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,190
can sometimes be a bit obscure then on

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,380
the same hand as like stuff like

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,890
kind of for each iterators and stuff out

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,710
there and that potentially makes things

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,900
be yeah this is a talk at render about

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:47,070
that and which will in turn the notes

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:50,280
basil yeah and just can't explain things

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,440
like for each sometimes like if you go

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,480
at like linguistically actor than people

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,160
can I can have on to be easier yeah but

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,270
I mean I think it's always really are to

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,790
see kind of coding concepts that people

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,800
are coming to like through from their

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,650
point of view like it's like some of the

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,530
some sometimes coaches like so obscure

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,110
and yeah detach from star sir yeah I

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,340
think a lot of you if you teaching on

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,290
the Australian 15 first there's an

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,700
appreciation for what the new features

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,440
are adding the structuring is another

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,330
good example like a Robin I'm do these

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,550
three variable devices I can just pull

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,280
them all out in one so yeah I think

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,720
there's a balance and classes again just

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,730
kind of syntactic sugar I won't want

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,810
someone to just pick up yes 2015 classes

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,230
without having a vague idea of what

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,670
they're doing by the scenes but you also

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,290
have to align somewhere it's like there

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,080
are some really nice array methods added

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,670
in yes following my map and elect or

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,620
filter I can never remember which one it

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,420
is called dr. Phil something might be

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,340
selecting Ruby them yeah it's one of the

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,740
two anyway whatever it is and there's

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,630
like some as well or every and all the

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,430
loans and I would teach those from the

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,500
from the beginning I think so be

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,390
interested seat like maybe because he

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,590
has 2015 is still relatively new we

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,530
think this but maybe in a couple of

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,000
years we might think yes 2015 as a

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,160
baseline to interesting to see whether

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,580
that line moves over at some time all

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,750
very interest is just so interesting

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:17,310
cool so I guess finally perhaps we could

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:19,080
talk about is how people can help other

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,240
people yeah what kind of things that you

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,880
can do absolutely yeah cuz we're just

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,770
making this up so we go ahead you know

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,870
there's a big misconception that you

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,700
have you know we know experts in this

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,540
right we just like doing it and I think

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,160
there are lots of people who could

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,690
probably just as well if not much better

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,190
yeah yeah basically yeah I guess yeah

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:43,660
right much better than me

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,550
oh cool cool so what would you say is

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,470
that if i'm watching this is someone who

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,270
wants to kind of get started maybe

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,600
teaching of it work or watch you go so

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,790
i'd say like so one of the things i

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,540
helped do is how it has a a meet-up up

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,410
an oxford can n javascript web group and

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,020
we're always looking for people together

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:05,230
then contribute talks and that can be

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,000
really great way if you've got if you've

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,920
learned something if you've kind of got

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,320
something to share and get in contact

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,700
with a group in this it's such a good

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,350
like it can be really rewarding

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,610
experience yeah i'm going to share that

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,510
information really useful pretty cool

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,490
yeah it's definitely like the very low

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,290
pressure environment as well i think

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,270
people also surprised about how few

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,160
people actually proposed talks to meet

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,440
ups totally i think a good example of

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,050
this is i was looking at the london node

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,910
user group website up there i think our

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,280
colleague Alex Linda's to it and they've

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,630
gotta get up repo for proposing talks

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,700
and this is London node group they have

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,900
a load of members and their meetups use

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,910
your very busy in they have maybe to

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,700
talk proposals so I think most meetups

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,100
are like absolutely desperate for people

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,380
to go into each other and everyone there

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,030
I want you to do it good tour but is

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,380
willing to kind of go with it and

00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,490
support you in it they're fairly chill

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,890
because I want to just come from work

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,480
they don't like and really you know it's

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,730
not too intense it's pretty relaxed as

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,500
usually like beer or drinks available so

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,250
it's a nice environment yeah totally

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,780
yeah and yeah another thing I so I

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,080
jayhawks video or with the solver and as

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:13,510
a few hack days and like as the same for

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,070
the old school one you get if you can go

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,570
and tender and you'll end up at the end

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,890
teaching other people yeah that's like a

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,080
really can a great way of kind of

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,690
disseminating knowledge and stuff that's

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,150
really it's worthwhile just doing stuff

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,220
yeah yeah and then there's blogging yeah

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,930
I think we both think is a very good way

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,240
to also check that you know what you're

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,830
talking about as well yeah what a load

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,450
of my blog posts have come with the back

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,770
of me learning something and immediately

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,470
blogging about it and that's not me

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,940
being like you know that knowledgeable

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,470
about particular topics I just learned

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,750
something called on get this down and

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,310
pay

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,350
because other people find a cool let's a

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,230
really interesting as late as soon as so

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,360
you need to get over is as soon as you

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,640
realize how to do something you I

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,530
sometimes insulae feel like everyone

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,600
already knows it yeah and it's like it's

00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,490
kind of like okay I'm just working out

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,350
this thing as I art I'm sure a one

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,700
already kind of they don't need me to

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,650
tell them because i actually just doing

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,630
a quick post or a tweet like that is

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,980
actually really bad yeah absolutely I'm

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,350
really gonna be useful to someone ya

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,470
ain't looking at my like Bob stats some

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,970
of the most popular posts are once room

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,620
234 years ago about stuff that you'd

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,630
probably imagine and I are mostly known

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,370
everyone knows that the others so many

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,620
people come into the web show from all

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:26,630
levels that yeah people always need to

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,220
know stuff die so we like to round off

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,020
the show by doing any other business

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,720
where then I picked some things that we

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,580
found cool recently so then what if he

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,190
found cool recently so the coolest thing

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,160
by far was electromagnetic field which

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,650
was a kind of I guess it was like a kind

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,330
of tech event last weekend and it was

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,490
all it was like a festival and it was

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,280
like there was tons of stuff going on it

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,760
was just mind-blowing this is the badge

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,070
from it like the lies so it's actually

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,660
yes you can program it and do a whole

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,890
one that's pretty good bad here's a very

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,670
good back use your problem it to have a

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:05,090
different thing yeah but then I think

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:08,630
yeah you probably could do that yeah but

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:12,140
you're not having it ok front of and on

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,330
that events like so I am helping run

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,760
cult retreat in later this month which

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,340
is a main up in Oxford which I'm really

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,530
excited about and that's about it's a

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,440
happy but happy about bettering the way

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,980
you make cold cool which is cool and

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,990

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,550
about it yeah so yeah I dad that's my

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,170
kind of pics a nice anybody any other

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,200
business I have got any other business

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,500
I've got two pretty cool things to the

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,120
world of JavaScript the first is

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,520
Facebook released a thing called create

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,780
react which is a command line tool for

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,760
creating reactor kind of fun in either

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,290
the idea behind this is people get

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,790
bogged down and starting react posting

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,620
up web back from Babylon and all the

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,850
rest of it Craig react app kinda there's

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,680
one command you run that has it all set

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,050
up for you in it kind of shifts a bunch

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,490
of stuff out of the box for you so it's

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,960
really really good for people who just

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,520
want to get started with react I would

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,250
for example probably use it in my

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,290
workshops because people don't demand me

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,300
so a bunch of stuff it got some

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,650
criticism around like because it

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,180
abstract Saul they're like no level

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,320
tools away but I don't see that as an

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,610
issue because I think it's at all very

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,280
much for beginners I think the people

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,960
who wouldn't use this tool shouldn't use

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,130
that tool I probably won't use it my

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,140
produce because i like having full

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,420
control but i'm comfortable in that the

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,710
web pack like config and environment but

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,050
if you're brand new to react you want to

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,240
get going on at its sponsor that's very

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,950
nice category a very small part that

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,170
which I particular Jose they include an

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,000
eject commands so you can react create

00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,310
app eject and if you've in your

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,890
resisting react app and it will actually

00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,870
remove itself and give you all the

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,460
config so you can then take that as a

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,080
base to build on seemed kind of like

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,340
create a sack with the tool and then

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,930
when you want to customize it just ditch

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,630
the tool and move on which is a really

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,730
nice approach yeah finally sort of tweak

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,440
couple weeks go by someone the google

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,150
chrome team they're very close to

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,860
bringing a headless version of google

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,180
chrome you can actually run it now

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,610
working there are some very involved

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,140
steps so i haven't attempted it but this

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,880
means like the hats have kind of phantom

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,020
jess and those other tools should be

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,370
able to go away and be a place with an

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,340
actual headless version of chrome we

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,200
should make browser testing way easier

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,050
awesome i'm sorry i started guys excited

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,330
yeah and finally this is going to be my

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:42,820
last Jack and Ben show yeah yeah

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,159
