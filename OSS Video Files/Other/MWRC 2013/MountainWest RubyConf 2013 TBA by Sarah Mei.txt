hey

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:28,619
hi thank you good afternoon I'm Sarah

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,849
Mae and I'm so thrilled I've heard about

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,739
this conference from other people for

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,290
years and I'm really thrilled to be here

00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:38,250
finally the last time i was in salt lake

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,650
city was nineteen ninety eight things

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,750
have changed quite a bit the last 15

00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,300
years the last time i was here there

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,730
were no bars only private clubs there

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,980
were no tattoo parlors that you could

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,440
see anyway and there were two coffee

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,329
shops in the entire city and they were

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,649
both terrible so given this i'm

00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,760
expecting probably that the next time i

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,230
visit you guys are going to have like

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,489
medical marijuana clubs or something

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:09,690
right it just seems like that's the

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,050
direction you're going uh so so as you

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,330
can see I totally did not forget to

00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,810
email Mike Moore the title and abstract

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,950
of my talk and I have to apologize for

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,179
that uh it's been a rough year or so for

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,429
me and my family and so I'm really

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,050
grateful to be here at all I'm grateful

00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,670
to Mike and the other organizers for

00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,009
inviting me and I'm really grateful that

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,390
all y'all stuck around to the end to

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,149
hear a talk that you had no idea what it

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,800
was going to be about so thank you so

00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,970
what I actually want to talk about today

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,679
is work play and code I don't know if

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,590
you guys saw bill Chapman's talk this

00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:49,140
morning about different ways of thinking

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,489
about how you work and this talk is

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,349
going to expand on those ideas a bit

00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:56,670
because to me the most important part of

00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,780
work is play but before we get is that

00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,580
let me tell you a little bit about Who I

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,429
am I don't do that normally when I do

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,379
talks because I figure you know Google

00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:05,520
is your friend but it actually is

00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,580
relevant to what we're talking about so

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,020
this is me on all of the important parts

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,500
of the internet which would be like

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,750
twitter and github basically right I am

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,060
a ruby developer at pivotal labs in San

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,550
Francisco if it there about three years

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,920
I work with clients I'm also the

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,840
co-founder of railsbridge we are a

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,069
four-year-old organization now and we

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,530
try to make our communities more

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,939
welcoming to newcomers and our

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,670
best-known program is probably the

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,900
railsbridge workshops for women which

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,099
introduced several thousand of them to

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,959
Ruby and rails all over the world sesame

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,220
my work at pivotal as I mentioned has

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,410
been working with clients and most of my

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,319
clients have been organizations that are

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,180
growing quickly and specifically

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,940
organizations that are adding developers

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,520
to their team so what I do with them is

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,840
I help them build a product and help

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,540
them build a team and oh those two

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,920
things the team and the product I've

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,180
discovered that building the product is

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,319
by far the easier of those two things

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,940
growing an engineering team the right

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,910
way is actually a really hard problem

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,560
and even even just being a developer not

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,660
just not a manager but just a developer

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,230
on a team that is growing rapidly is a

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,730
really hard problem so so this talk

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,910
comes out of those experience as well as

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,430
some research I've done in my own um so

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,620
getting back to the original idea and

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,940
I'm sure nobody in this room falls in

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,989
this category by show of hands anyone

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:35,370
have fun writing Ruby code okay thank

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,900
you you're my people I think I do too

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,640
you know I love it I love the language

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,579
part of it is the language itself right

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,850
as matt said yesterday ruby is now 20

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:48,180
years old and he said that that makes

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,590
Ruby an adult in Japan what he didn't

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,030
mention and this is perhaps because he's

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,769
LDS and doesn't actually indulge himself

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,950
is that 20 is also the legal drinking

00:03:52,769 --> 00:04:00,030
age in Japan and so now that y'all have

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,560
brew pubs we can have a beer and but

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,570
what I what I love about Ruby probably

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,100
even more than the language is that I

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,810
love the community around it right as

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,910
matt said yesterday rubios love events

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,019
they love conferences they love meetups

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,329
they'd love to go out and talk to people

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,680
you know how unusual it is find a

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,459
developer community where people want to

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,669
talk to each other that's pretty weird

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,750
kind of awesome and I've never I've

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,130
never I've been in a lot of different

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,289
developer communities I've never been in

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,860
one that actually was more creative and

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:31,830
more fun more social and had so many

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,479
other interests besides code and so many

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,610
interesting projects to work on but many

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,660
of us in this room have a problem and

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,950
the problem looks like this it looks

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,599
like success we are so successful ruby

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,310
has been amazingly successful right is

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,880
the language itself has gone from what's

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,180
essentially a fringe language

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,580
to almost maybe a mainstream language in

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,960
just a couple years right and so a lot

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,170
of things that used to be small have

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,190
gotten bigger symptom number one in the

00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,930
last year we've started seeing a lot of

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,910
conference talks and blog articles and

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,500
books that are started to appear around

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,740
this idea of what happens when your

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,090
rails app rose up right we're talking

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,650
about rails engines we're talking about

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,870
components we're talking about software

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,890
architecture we're talking about object

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:17,500
design even dhh as message he hates over

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,420
design is talking with people about this

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,710
right in terms of rails because it's an

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,690
important question right now write these

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,940
things don't matter in a small code base

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,740
your object factoring doesn't matter if

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,350
you're all of your code can be kept in

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,790
your head and what this tells us is

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,020
little since so many of us are hitting

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,480
these growing pains at the same time

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,950
this is telling us that our that that

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,390
we're running into the same problems

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,780
right our small code bases have gotten

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:45,040
big symptom number two who remembers

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,290
when Twitter was 12 people know long

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,180
time ago I was a long time ago and

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,590
they're not the only one right a lot of

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,050
companies that made their money off of a

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,150
ruby product a lot of them have grown

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,230
they've been IP owed they've been

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:02,080
acquired and so we as developers are

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,780
working on larger teams right what used

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,480
to be three developers in a co-working

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,650
space is now 25 developers in their own

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,790
office right and you can see that you

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,140
can see that in the way that we discuss

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,200
as a community we discuss like remote

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:21,640
work for example then my small companies

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,290
have gotten large and finally we've

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,510
started seeing some really really big

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,630
companies come into our Ruby community

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,140
right the HP's the IBM's the GES right

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,920
they're starting to they're starting to

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,120
they're starting to come in their

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,230
sharting to hire a lot of Ruby people

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,630
they're starting to grow a lot of Ruby

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,090
people from from their interior and

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,270
there's not a whole lot we can do to

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,010
stop something that large and I've heard

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,290
the same story from a lot of different

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,370
people in the last year it goes

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,840
something like this I was a ruby

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,190
developer and i joined like a couple of

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,560
my friends and we like started building

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,970
this product it was amazing and we all

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,350
sat in the same space and we talked to

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,520
each other and it was great and then we

00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,900
were successful we hired some more

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,850
people and then we hired a couple more p

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,009
then we heard some more people and then

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,000
we kept making money somehow and like

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,500
yeah they just yeah that what do we do

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,910
again what do I do with this many people

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,259
write the stuff that used to work with a

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,850
team of three doesn't work with the team

00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,080
of ten and that is the stuff that you do

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,000
with the team of ten doesn't work with a

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,940
team of 25 and when you try and start

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,110
putting a process into place for a team

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,320
that gets larger as you necessarily

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,479
start to make more formal the things

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,639
that used to be informal it's kind of a

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,910
scary thing to be doing right because

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,260
we're all afraid of this we're all

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,760
afraid of ending up here and we're

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,800
afraid basically that the company's

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,780
growth and the team's growth is going to

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,570
suck all the fun out of our programming

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,780
and having worked for a big company

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:54,250
myself in the past this is a legitimate

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:58,000
fear but the interesting thing about

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,240
fear is that looking at our fear can

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,650
surface some of the some of the

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,690
interesting assumptions that we've been

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,099
making about ourselves as programmers so

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,510
here's one that I've noticed popping up

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:13,180
a lot recently every call it three or

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,710
five months there'll be a article at the

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,919
top of hacker news be something like

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,650
this two sides there's two sides to the

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
developer world and as a developer you

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,250
are on one side or you are on the other

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,690
side you are an established company

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,849
person or you are a startup company

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,789
person and if you're an established

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,289
company person what you like is process

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,330
you're very focused you know what you're

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,469
building your determined and the other

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,510
side would probably say you were have a

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,339
little tunnel vision if your startup

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,979
person you're creative you have ideas

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,930
you want to disrupt things and the other

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,570
side would say you're a bit immature and

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,589
these categories have a lot of different

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,060
headers people talk about them in

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,080
different with different titles but

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,330
they're also kind of the same things

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,850
like for example if you're talking to

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,010
Paul Graham who founded y combinator

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,140
which is a little company in Silicon

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,000
Valley that funds 20-somethings in their

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,220
garages then these are kind of your

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,839
headers old people and young people

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,089
anyone go to the wausau conference just

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,769
like a month ago there's a there's a

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:16,939
speaker there Michael lop right

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,769
and his headers were these you know and

00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:21,949
no matter she's talking about it though

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,239
what it's clear is that as an individual

00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,920
developer at any given time in your life

00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,809
you are in one of these categories or

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,559
the other wait you may move between

00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:33,559
categories I mean Paul Graham thinks you

00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,549
do as soon as you hit 30 right but the

00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,399
assumption here is that these are

00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:38,600
different types of people and some

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,970
people will even say that you need to

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,920
hire both types of people like pit them

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,540
against each other in order to balance

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,259
growth and stability as your company

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,869
gets bigger we'll come back to that idea

00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:53,089
but right now what I'd like to do is is

00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:54,980
inject a little bit of science into this

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,360
conversation because all of these

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,309
categorizations all of these blog posts

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,660
and all these books that people have

00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:01,699
written including what I am actually

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,649
summarizing for you today is one

00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:05,809
person's experience right generalizing

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,879
over their experience and maybe talking

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:11,480
to a few other people and that can be

00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:13,699
useful but my dad who had a PhD in

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,720
entomology had a saying that he liked

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:21,230
and what he meant by this

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:27,110
is that a collection of anecdotes does

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,339
not add up to science and so what I want

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,129
to do is I want to look at some of the

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,720
science that exists around these

00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,189
categorizations that we put ourselves in

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,670
I want to start with creativity because

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:39,259
if you look at these lists the

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,019
generalization here is that the staple

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,490
side is boring and uncreated the

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,930
volatile side is fun and creative right

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,449
there's clearly a right side for you to

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,740
be on here but all the other properties

00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,000
in these lists sort of flow from that

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,889
judgment about whether someone is

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,209
creative or not creative right so let's

00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:56,839
look at the science around creativity

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,250
for a moment in the 1970s there was some

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,040
fascinating work done on the qualities

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,170
of creative people and they took you

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,430
scientists took two groups of people one

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,379
group of people identified by their

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,730
peers as being very creative and one

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,120
group of people identified by the crew

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,290
by their peers as being uncreated and

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,850
they looked for statistically

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,279
significant differences between these

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,699
groups of people so here are some things

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,000
that completely did not matter strangely

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:24,500
enough intelligence exceedingly smart

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,870
people no more likely to be creative

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,459
than average intelligent people age

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,490
gender race all these things didn't

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:34,699
matter either they actually found no

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,899
innate differences at all between people

00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,209
who are creative and people who are not

00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,879
creative what they did find where

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:44,689
differences in behavior and differences

00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,920
in their habits and i'll come back to

00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,449
what those differences are in a moment

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,040
but i think it might help at this point

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:50,779
to define creativity a little more

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,000
precisely because i think we all have a

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,399
feeling for what it is and whether or

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
not we are one but science has been

00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,819
thinking about this for a while let's

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,180
see what they think so so scientists can

00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:03,740
have distinguished two modes of thinking

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,149
that human beings engaged in the closed

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,339
mode at the open mode when you're in

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:11,000
closed mode you are getting very

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,230
specific things done I guess the

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,139
scientific term for this is like getting

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,910
 done right actually they call it

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,350
being executive far as I can tell so

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,180
your goals are specific your focus

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,309
you're doing things and then the open

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,269
mode you may have some general goals but

00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,610
what you're doing really isn't very

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:29,149
focused and you're open to new

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,980
connections and it's in open mode where

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,899
creative thought can occur so

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,389
first part of being a creative person is

00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:40,279
just knowing how to move between these

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:41,959
modes of thought deliberately so these

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,760
lists they look awfully familiar don't

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,139
they right they look a lot like the

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,510
categorizations that we do to ourselves

00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,860
and that we do in the community when

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,139
we're thinking about categories of

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,370
developers right my big company person

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:57,470
am I executive my task oriented or am I

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,380
stable forever am I a small company

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,399
person right am I unfocused were you

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,089
know we're figuring out our product

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,410
market fit and it turns out that the

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:07,699
people who would like to put us in one

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,560
of these categories or the other have

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,540
hacked have actually hit upon something

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,360
that's a real dichotomy and human

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,260
thought right these are different things

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,459
but there are different types of people

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,720
there's simply different modes of

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,910
thought and and it's a critical error to

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,610
say that a person is one or the other

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:34,160
because we are all both at different

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:40,190
times April is National Poetry Month you

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:42,430
know Plus this is a reminder to me to

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,430
breathe

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,250
so when I realize that that that both of

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,440
that all of us are both of these things

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,640
all the time it took me a while to

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,960
understand the implication there because

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,080
a person might be more comfortable in

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:04,700
one motor thought or the other right but

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,870
we are all capable of both and what this

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,520
means is that creativity is not a

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,860
property that you have or you don't have

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,200
were born with or you weren't it's a

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,460
skill that you can practice and get

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,860
better at so when people say that you

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,900
need both to balance each other that's

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,040
actually true right because you do need

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,200
both of these things that software

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,720
development each of us though needs to

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,640
be able to do both and a technical

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,440
leader shouldn't be trying to like hire

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,480
people that fit these architects and are

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,620
these archetypes rather and like make

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,510
them fight a technical leaders goals

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,960
should be allowed to be to enable their

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,250
people to do both at the right time and

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,840
at this point I think it's fair to ask

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,820
like what does this mean in terms of

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,670
software development what does this look

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,930
like and what is creativity really mean

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,180
in terms of software development cuz a

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,770
lot of people think you know when I

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,850
graduated from school they handed me a

00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:00,710
piece of paper and it said computer

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,380
science on it and my brother who's a

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,660
pharmacist I believe thinks about my job

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,250
pretty much as typing as far as you can

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:12,470
tell like what does this really have to

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,820
do with art and poetry and music humor

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,790
and dance right how are these things

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,210
those things are creative doesn't feel

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,890
like what we do sometimes I am NOT I've

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,380
never been a professional artist I'm a

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,030
consumer only what I see when I look at

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,800
art is the result right I see the

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,970
sculpture I see the painting and as far

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
as I could tell for a long time how I

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,320
figured this work is that an artist

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,180
would go into a cave do a bunch of stuff

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,940
I didn't really understand and then

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,890
emerge with their work of genius right

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,000
it turns out that that's completely

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,380
wrong this this lady is is an American

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,680
dancer and choreographer her name is

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,910
Twyla Tharp she's 71 years old she's

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,270
been doing this her whole life and and

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,040
at 71 she is still considered one of the

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,580
most creative forces in contemporary

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,630
dance and she wrote a fantastic book

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,560
that I highly recommend called the

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,020
creative habit

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,450
and the core of this book is her

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,820
explanation of her creative process her

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,670
process for how she comes up with a new

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,140
dance as a choreographer and how it

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,170
works is this happens over the course of

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,700
several months every day in the morning

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,830
she spent several hours dancing her sort

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,130
of standard routines and moves that

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,870
she's been doing for the last 40 years

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,330
and she's moving her body in these very

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,940
familiar ways that she knows she can do

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,339
without even thinking about it she's

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,200
executing she's comfortable right and

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,860
then in the afternoon she works on

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,850
coming up with new movements in the

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,800
movement that she does in the morning is

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,120
the raw material that gives her a base

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,130
that she can use in the afternoon to

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,830
refactor into something new and her

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,020
process deliberately moves her between

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,540
the closed mode in the morning and the

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,560
open mode in the afternoon she needs

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,940
both to come up with a new dance because

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,050
if all she does is dance the old move

00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,339
she'll never come up with anything new

00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,900
but if all she does is noodle around

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,430
with the new stuff she lacks the base

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,400
from which the creative changes can be

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,140
made so her creativity isn't a lightning

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,490
strike out of nowhere right you go to

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,319
one of her dances and it looks like it

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,100
must be right like where did this come

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,890
from this is awesome but her creativity

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,620
is actually a repeating methodical habit

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,760
that she has that gets her in the best

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,339
situation for the lightning to strike

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,560
and that lines up with the science right

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,530
people who are creative have simply

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,510
developed habits that move themselves

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,490
between the closed and open modes of

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,800
thought and it's the movement between

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,420
these modes that's the key because each

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,290
one feeds the other so let's look at

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,800
what that looks like when you're writing

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:45,020
code so this should look familiar I hope

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:49,790
yes one person okay all right all right

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,110
all right just making sure red green or

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,190
factor right first you write a failing

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,870
tests then you write the code that makes

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,790
a pass then you refactor the code to try

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,010
to make it better so in practice it's

00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,420
more like this right you go kind of red

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,800
green red green red green red green red

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,330
green for a while and then you get some

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,600
sort of stand-alone portion of your

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,130
feature done and then you refactor and

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,980
just in case you've never seen this done

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,570
before this is what this looks like so

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,549
think about adding a method to a rails

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,200
model right you've got a model for a bus

00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,360
and you need a method that tells you how

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,850
many ipads are on that bus in the

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,149
passengers bags so first you write a

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,159
model spec that fails then you write the

00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:26,210
method model spec goes green then you

00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,749
realize the story is asking for

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:32,179
registered iPads and not just plain iPad

00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:34,489
so you add a new line to the spec which

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:37,480
then goes red again they can't implement

00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:41,629
it on the model everything goes green

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,320
but yeah the code looks pretty bad but

00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:47,090
your tests are green so at this point

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,889
you have thousands of options for what

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,389
you could do with this code you could

00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:53,779
leave it where it is tester green right

00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:55,519
it's working you could extract it into a

00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,019
class you could extract parts of it you

00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,359
could leave parts of it in the model you

00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,279
could reimagine your entire domain model

00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,989
you could rewrite the whole thing in

00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,629
nodejs right like you've got lots of

00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:08,359
options and at this point you've gone

00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:09,859
into the refactoring phase so let's talk

00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,960
about what's different about these two

00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,549
phases of the cycle first thing that's

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,190
interesting about this is the words that

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,139
we use to talk about code change between

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,450
these two modes so if you're pairing

00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,499
these are the words you say out loud if

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,700
you're on your own i guess this is your

00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,309
internal monologue not quite sure how

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,690
that works anymore but either way we go

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,009
from talking sort of nuts and bolts of

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,690
the functionality like oh I think we're

00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,840
missing an end made that context doesn't

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,330
need to be there and we go to discussing

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,330
more the larger sense of like where code

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,769
belongs right no that method had a name

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,059
that made sense but now it does too much

00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,859
it feels like we should either split it

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,379
or move it out to the class or maybe we

00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:47,419
should make it its own class the next

00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:49,190
thing that changes is the like the way

00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,080
we use the keyboard alright so we're

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,340
entering code when we're in the red

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,409
green cycle we're like putting in our

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,359
teaches in our injects and then we move

00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,639
into like moving code around right we

00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,309
move it between classes we move it into

00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:03,350
new files we move it around and the

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,210
third thing that changes is our physical

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,649
posture when you're when you're writing

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,299
code in your red green or factoring your

00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:09,590
hands around the keyboard and you're

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:11,600
leaning in and you're looking at the

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,919
code and then when you go into the

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,210
refactoring mode kind of take your hands

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,830
off the keyboard and you're going to sit

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,179
back a little bit you just look at your

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,289
code for a while and fundamentally right

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,759
what's happening in these two different

00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,820
modes is that we're thinking about the

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,990
code differently how we're thinking

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,380
about that code has changed between

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,990
these

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,220
two modes and so when you're doing the

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,300
red green red green you're operating in

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,470
the closed mode and then when you were

00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,140
factored you're moving into the open

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,520
mode so just like Twyla Tharp's process

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,410
is a structured way for her to spend

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,930
some time in the open mode and sometime

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,670
the closed mode red green refactor is a

00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,170
structured way of moving us between the

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,800
closed and open modes from a writing

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,660
code it's a habit that we have that

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,560
gives us room to think creatively every

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,670
time we write code there's one piece of

00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,190
this puzzle we haven't talked about and

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,980
that is when you're in the open mode and

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:04,970
everything is possible how do you

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,680
proceed the process has given you this

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,920
creative space how do you get that

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,060
lightning to strike and it's often a

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,760
matter of being able to shift your

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,960
context appropriately to and to consider

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,980
the code that you wrote in a larger

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,960
context and that shift is the germ of

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,400
creativity no matter what type of

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,230
creativity we're talking about whether

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,610
it's painting or comedy or poetry all of

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,070
these creative works gain power by

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,480
showing the viewer context that they

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,630
hadn't noticed before let me give you

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,510
another example humor everybody loves a

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,950
good light bulb joke right how many folk

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,490
singers does it take to change a light

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,870
bulb answer 51 to change the bulb and

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,160
forward to sing about how much better

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:48,680
the old one was how many anarchists does

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,360
it take to change a light bulb answer

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,050
none because everybody knows they never

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,050
change anything

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,110
and if you find me at the drink up

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,560
tonight I'll tell you ashamed Becker's

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,850
follow up to that one and finally I'm

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,410
going to take that cheap shot how many

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,320
enterprise developers does it take to

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:10,090
change a light bulb answer none we are

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,090
not going to change it we think it works

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,040
so it's that shift of contacts between

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,420
the setup and the punch line that makes

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,880
jokes funny right and so once you get

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,990
into the creative mode that step one but

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,910
if you want to be able to come up with

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,190
these flashes of insight if you want to

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,480
write the jokes you need to be able to

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,800
make that context switch once you're

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,510
there if I were a management consultant

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,650
I'd call it thinking outside the box and

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,870
then you have to shoot me but really

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,930
it's just contact shifting that allows

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,960
you to see what looks like an

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:45,080
unintuitive answer to the problem at

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,400
hand and I'll state the obvious and say

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,660
that different developers have different

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,620
levels of skill with this type of

00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,240
thinking um I've been preparing full

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,490
time for about three years at this point

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,440
and I counted it up I think I've paired

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,550
with about a hundred and fifty different

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,050
people over the course of that time and

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,270
some of them when we're sitting there

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,600
looking at a refactoring seem to always

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,340
come up with a pretty decent solution

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,290
sometimes it feels a lot like luck you

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,090
know especially on a big project there's

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,180
a lot of code no one person knows all of

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,190
it but the lucky people seem to always

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,290
just been in you know looking at some

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,180
other part of the code in a completely

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,350
different part of the app that had a

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,350
pattern that might work here if we

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,250
change certain things about it so I was

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,010
thinking about that and then I ran

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,000
across another piece of science that

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,250
talked about what's different about

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,830
people who consider themselves lucky and

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,360
people who consider themselves unlucky

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,100
and the first thing they did was studied

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,370
whether people who think they are lucky

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,190
actually are and the way that they did

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,210
that was that they took people who think

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,380
they're lucky people who think they're

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,300
not lucky and they gave them a section

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,350
of the newspaper and they said I want

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,520
you to look through the section of the

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,740
newspaper and count the number of

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,310
photographs and then report that number

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,890
back to the researcher on the second

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,140
page of the newspaper section was big

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,140
half page advertisement with no photos

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,399
on it said in really big text STOP there

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,719
are 37 photos

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,719
go tell the researcher

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,309
and people who consider themselves to be

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:20,750
lucky way more often saw that and save

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,250
themselves from like actually looking

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,320
through 15 pages of newspaper and

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:29,570
Counting photographs then people who

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,890
thought they were unlucky and so having

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,870
just you know sort of having established

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:37,040
that the that the people who are lucky

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:38,510
do actually seem to experience the world

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,650
differently that kind of did the same

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,970
thing that they did with the creativity

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,860
research which is that they then looked

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,809
for differences between these groups of

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,890
people and just like the creativity

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:47,570
research they found that there is

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,799
absolutely no intrinsic difference

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,880
between someone who's lucky and someone

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,700
who's unlucky there are differences of

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,500
course in behavior but what that means

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,500
is that just like creativity luck is a

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,049
skill that you can practice and get

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,410
better at and it turns out that people

00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:09,470
who are lucky deliberately seek novelty

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,610
in all parts of their lives and this can

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,010
manifest itself lots of different ways

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,030
right given the choice of two paths walk

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,830
they will pick the one they have not

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,940
walked on you put them in a restaurant

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,799
to order a dish they haven't ordered

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,320
before these are little things little

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,000
things right but they but by the theory

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,679
here is that by deliberately exposing

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,750
themselves to things that are not in

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,460
their comfort zone they are changing the

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,470
mode in which their brain works they are

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,820
making it more open and that means they

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,850
notice things they wouldn't normally

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,890
notice and the end result is that they

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,250
are more able to see the context shifts

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,710
and that makes them unusual creative and

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,059
effective problem solvers and they're

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,690
setting themselves up for that lightning

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:48,980
strike so you can practice being

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,740
creative and you can practice being

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,780
lucky and that sets you have to take

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,240
best advantage of both of these modes of

00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,429
thought because we want all of these

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,780
things even the tunnel vision and the

00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:01,460
immaturity right we want the whole

00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:06,410
richness of human thought brought to

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:08,450
bear on our problems but and and so but

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,730
the interesting thing is in the world of

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,440
software development it's hard for us to

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,299
think about this but there are ways

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,860
besides red green refactor that you can

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:19,220
introduce creative space into your

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,330
projects the development process we do

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,710
at pivotal has a lot in common with

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,020
extreme programming basically how it

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,670
works is that we pair up in the morning

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,020
and we take whatever stories at the top

00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,050
of the backlog we work on it we finish

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,070
it we deliver it then we pick up the

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,120
next story that's at the top of the

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:38,330
backlog and we work on that internal two

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,080
pivotal we call this the story mill

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:43,140
because we're just kind of churning

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,640
through stories and it feels amazing I

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,930
have to tell you it feels amazing and

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,850
fantastic to get so much stuff done but

00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,130
once a week we do something different we

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,810
don't do that many meetings most days we

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,940
actually spend eight hours on the story

00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,130
mill but once a week we do a one-hour

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,230
retrospective which is a meeting that is

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,180
our chance to consider how our process

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,610
is working and how we'd like to change

00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,170
it and I could not do this process

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,630
without the retrospectives because the

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,250
story mill is closed mode is this really

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,620
freaking closed right we are very

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,690
focused but retros are the open mode

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,520
that balanced that right no process ever

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,470
works the same for two organizations so

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,850
but it's usually not obvious when you're

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,430
in the thick of it what exactly needs to

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,840
be changed and you need to so doing

00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,760
these retros once a week is a structured

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,400
way for us to introduce creative

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,990
thinking into our process the same way

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,310
that the refactor stage is a structured

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,260
way to introduce creative thinking into

00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:39,090
our coding so because process when it's

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,370
done right is what enables us to be

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,050
creative and being creative is what

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,720
enables us to build great software and

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,310
the process gives us that space it

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,440
teaches us the habits of creative people

00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:53,310
and if that's not what yours feels like

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,660
that's a problem and if you're at a

00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,800
company that's growing or already big

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,180
and you need to start adding more

00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,350
structure to your development process

00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,220
because it's not just the three of you

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:04,290
in a garage anymore there's a thousand

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,490
ways to do it right and I can't tell you

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,260
what the right thing to do is because it

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,430
depends on your people your product the

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,030
rest of your company what your financial

00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:15,540
structure is where you live but the one

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,010
thing that's important here is to make

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,280
sure that the process you add is

00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,980
enabling creativity rather than

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,180
squashing it and make sure it's not

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,970
squeezing all the fun out of your

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,210
development make sure that it's got that

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:33,570
it's got built in places for creativity

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,940
to occur because it's that fun and that

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,170
play and that serendipity that makes it

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,779
impossible for us to write great

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,649
software

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:42,879
and finally it's your job it's set

00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:44,139
yourself up so that lightning can strike

00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:46,090
when it needs to right and what that

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,499
means is you need to introduce enough

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,149
novelty into your life for you to take

00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:53,320
advantage of that time that the process

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,309
gives you and to do this you don't need

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,499
to spend a hundred twenty thousand

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,519
dollars on for years of art school teach

00:28:56,499 --> 00:29:00,909
you how to be creative here are some

00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,440
things you can do look at parts of your

00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,419
code base beyond what's immediately in

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,169
front of you so if you see a method

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,009
being used you don't know how it's

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:10,299
implemented go look at it just be like

00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:12,789
three parts of the code you haven't seen

00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:14,320
in a while fill your mind with the raw

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,700
material for creative thought and second

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,979
try to vary what you do as much as

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,929
possible switch projects every couple of

00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:21,460
months if you can if you can't spend

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:23,019
some time writing JavaScript if you're

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,460
back in developer or doing some sequel

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,279
optimization if you're a front-end

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,450
developer the main rule here is that

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,769
when you start feeling comfortable with

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,119
what you're doing it's time to move on

00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:36,099
and third seek out teams that have

00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:37,719
people that don't look like you this is

00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,849
an interesting hack there's been some

00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:44,440
research that says if you have to

00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:46,059
problem solving teams and what they do

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,619
require some creative thought and one

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,849
team is better qualified on paper but

00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,249
they all look the same and the other

00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:53,039
team is less qualified on paper but they

00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:55,509
have visual differences between them

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,969
this means things like height and weight

00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:59,499
race and gender ability and so on then

00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:02,979
the team that is less qualified on paper

00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:05,259
consistently does better and the theory

00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:07,809
here is similar to the luck theory which

00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,919
is that if you are communicating with

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,019
people that are outside of your

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,700
immediate comfort zone you are

00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,349
automatically opening your mind up and

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,779
you're moving it more into the open mode

00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:18,099
and if you have a job that requires any

00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,169
kind of creative thinking which I hope

00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,820
you all do that means that you'll be

00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,409
better at coming up with creative

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,649
problem creative solutions to the

00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:30,070
problems you're looking at and finally

00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:32,549
make sure you're having fun because you

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:37,529
cannot write good software without it

00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:37,529
and that's all I got thank you everybody

00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:16,940
