Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Hell Has Frozen Over: DevOps & Security by James Turnbull
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	A lot of Dev and Ops people look at their security teams with disdain: "Those guys are arseholes. All they ever do is sit in meetings and tell us no." They know there's no way Security will ever embrace DevOps. In turn many security folks see the emergence of DevOps as the inmates being put in charge of the asylum. It'll all end in chaos and disaster.
So who's right? Can DevOps and security co-exist? Can they be friends? We will take a deeper look at:
What DevOps means for Security
How DevOps can be sold to Security
How DevOps changes the risk landscape for the better
How those Security folks might know some things that could make DevOps better
You'll see how DevOps and Security can have a long and prosperous friendship that makes more awesome.

hey

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,250
so good morning so my job this morning

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:34,530
is called hell has frozen over devops

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:36,870
and security to cooperate alright we're

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,370
going to talk so who am i I'm James

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,540
tumble i work at puppet labs i was one

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,070
of the early employees of Papa labas

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,010
before that I was the release management

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,059
with a puppet project I wrote a lot of

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,320
the documentation which is now

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,589
thankfully being written by people who

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,899
speak proper English before that I was

00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:54,239
report to the chief security officer at

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,559
a large Australian bank and I was ran a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,629
cert team for those who committee with

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,870
cert computer emergency response team

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,489
it's largely about the fraud security

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,170
incident management and I've been

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,360
security architect and operations person

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,740
for about 20 years I've written six

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,479
technical books including two about

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,220
puppet I've just released a book called

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,740
the log stash book about log stash which

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,610
is an open-source logging tool even if

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,380
you don't buy the book you should look

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
at logstash it's really awesome view

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,090
something like splunk or log lee it's a

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,940
very cheap alternative and i think it's

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,440
it's a pretty cool project i always say

00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,360
this in Josh Chamberlain to tease me

00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,009
earlier I am Australian I talked with a

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,229
funny accent and I have a habit of

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,940
talking very quickly if you don't

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,759
understand something I say don't be

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,550
ashamed of what your hand up and go huh

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,899
I don't take offense there's about six

00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,399
other Australians in the audience and

00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,420
they may be the only ones who understand

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,810
me through the whole top or so here we

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,700
go this one I have to bottom line here I

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,259
also being Australian to have the

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,729
occasional habit of dropping words that

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,880
are inappropriate into my presentations

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,979
its cultural I'm really sorry about it I

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,690
try really hard not to but occasionally

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,429
bad words come out and I apologize in

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:06,179
advance I'm doing working really hard to

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:10,709
try and prevent that at ninja ok so does

00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:14,910
anyone here work in operations maybe

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:20,370
maybe a i'm not a huge crew how about

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,170
developers ok i'm pretty sure from jeans

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,550
to talk that that are that me and gene

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,560
is the only security people in the room

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,819
is that right josh josh is going to

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,969
claim to be a security person i guess he

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,670
was in the past will claim that

00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:34,920
so I spent about about 10 years working

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,569
in IT security in little organizations

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,760
and big organizations and my last job

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,640
was a massive enterprise organization

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,769
had about 50,000 staff and about 6,000

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,290
IT staff and IT security is about 300

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,670
people and I left that job to go and

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,019
work in a start-up and one of the

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,950
reasons I some of the reasons I left

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,590
that job is I didn't really like it

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,519
wasn't a lot of fun and there's a

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,329
there's a number of reasons why it

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,069
wasn't a lot of fun here's the things I

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,450
hated about security people don't like

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,670
you I actually would have project

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,109
managers who would hide like I would go

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,340
and visit a project team and the project

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,569
manager would go and get coffee because

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,989
he was hurt I was walking across the

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,129
campus tour was his building because

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,989
you're not usually the bearer of good

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,459
news usually the guy who goes yeah we

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,540
just tested that curtain wow you guys

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,359
should really salt those passwords

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,560
because yeah we cracked all of them and

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,819
that's the last thing a project want to

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,810
mention wants to hear a week before the

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:28,379
project goes live my I wasn't very

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,819
effective at my job because I was I was

00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,349
sort of security sort of an afterthought

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,940
on a lot of organizations it's something

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,579
that comes along at the end and sort of

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,379
know well we're code review this code or

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,359
will penetration test this application

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,709
by the time you get that all of that

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,060
done it's like the day before the

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,349
application is going to go alive and no

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,340
one is going to is going to say we're

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,560
going to stop we're not going to pull

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,470
the trigger so it was hard to actually

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,549
do you know be good at my job and all of

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,329
that resulted Amendment not being

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,359
particularly happy Anna so when I first

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,590
started I'm when I first started our

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,209
thinking about this particular topic I

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,440
stole a meme and you'll see a lot of

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,109
memes today but I still does me I like

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,090
to swim a lot it's the you know that

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,370
what people think people think things

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,129
you do so this is what generally what

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,930
the rest of IT think think that security

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,120
do know there's these guys with a

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,609
plastic cuffs and the battens and and

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,690
you know it's it's a i'm sure most

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,039
developers think they're somewhere on

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,740
the occupied Wall will occupy wall

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,599
street spectrum but this is security

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,669
come to hit your head on the head and I

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,530
number developers who tell me that they

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,909
have little time or respect for security

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,280
comes from this this phenomena what they

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,020
think security people like the

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,699
businesses even worse the business

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,380
thinks that where these totalitarian

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,990
guys who come in and say no you can't do

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,060
your job you can't sell that product and

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,010
the business generally set sees that

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,800
you know security is that these are no

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,480
entity like it's a group that generally

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,070
spends most of the time blocking that

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,630
the actual part of that these big

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,100
people's jobs that are really important

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,130
to them the actual selling a product or

00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:01,050
talking to a customer sadly this is what

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,430
security people think they do so and to

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,740
be honest there's some very very smart

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,360
people and security so you know to some

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,760
extent this is true you come across some

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,840
incredibly intelligent people and

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,490
they're capable of looking at really

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,870
complex problems in unusual ways and

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,150
come up with awesomely good solutions

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,690
but since there's a considerable

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,800
mismatch between these groups it's

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,520
important to understand what security

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,830
isn't so this is something that happened

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,450
very slowly in the security community in

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,600
about started about about eight nine

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,340
years ago there's a few people some

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,050
people may be familiar with them Kossak

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,850
and organizations like that where they

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,900
basically sat down and said you know why

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,660
do we always come to this conference

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,040
acuity conferences sit around the bar

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,479
drink hard liquor and talk to each other

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,860
about why our lives are miserable and

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,650
why we hate the teams will work with and

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,260
why the business thinks we suck and we

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,510
know a bunch of started and say well how

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,160
about if the first answer out of our

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,590
mouths wasn't no anymore it was

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,030
something else so what we'll be doing it

00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,380
or in return what will we do differently

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,640
that'll make security bit more

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,530
interesting so how about we do it about

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,000
partnership how about we actually look

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,550
at it in terms of we all work for the

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,229
same company me saying no to the IT

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,389
organization or no to the business about

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,550
something is not actually a productive

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,750
activity the productive way to deal with

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,360
this particular problem is me to say

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,030
okay this is my perspective this is my

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,130
view on how the world works and here's

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,620
why I think we have a problem how do we

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,060
work together to solve the problem and a

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,260
significant part of that equation is

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,520
that you have to accept the fact that

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,960
sometimes you're not going to win that

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,050
argument it's QT people don't like that

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,789
but they get there slowly as said

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,050
understanding and and and identifying

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,310
that all castes that all of the

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,470
customers and organization both the

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,060
external internal customers our

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,120
customers to our security helps

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,190
customers and that security persons

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,050
primary job is about increasing the

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,020
businesses risk appetite so the business

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,250
gets risk they understand you it's very

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,570
hot and user to come across a business

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,470
person who doesn't understand things

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,000
like credit and market

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,910
risk who doesn't understand what the

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,620
financials of their business are it's

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,330
very rare to find those people in IT and

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,090
it's even rarer to find them in security

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,350
so you need to start a screw to be money

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,760
to start to understand that their job is

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,430
actually to allow the business to take

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,110
no better risk decisions more aggressive

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,640
businesses and essentially your job is

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,070
sending a name of enablement all this

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,550
it's how do how do you help the business

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,620
do business so talked a lot about about

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,960
security so where does this where is

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,280
this sort of intersect with dev ops so

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,570
the group of people that sat down and

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,790
started talking about this concept of

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,020
security not saying no when DevOps came

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,700
along I started sending all of these

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,650
articles and so it was to a bunch of

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,390
these guys and like my god somebody else

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,940
in IT gets this stuff somebody else in

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,770
IT understands that you know this is a

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,870
collaborative cooperative venture it's

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,340
not it's not an exercise in us being

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,610
being hard asses and saying no to people

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,770
and we sat down and went you know how

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,880
would we adopt some of these ideas and

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,040
how would we make some of these ideas

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,450
work for security and there's a couple

00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,160
of reasons we chose to do that one was

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,810
that DevOps was a really powerful meme

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,110
at the time and it still is to some

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,940
extent and and that's useful for picking

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,200
things up people are less likely to be

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,510
resistant to things that I think other

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,669
popular people are doing it too and

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,140
DevOps is it currently in that sort of

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:15,240
you know cusp of adoptions at a phase

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,790
that sort of allows it to sneak in the

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,320
door and and and it's full of people

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,640
like me with tattoos and but hippie

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,650
hipster black glasses and you know

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,970
you're like oh guys at Flickr and John

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,370
wall's for an Etsy and those really cool

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,760
people they sell like crocheted things

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,650
there must be cool so that was it won't

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,110
ask the other aspect of it was that it's

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,510
actually a really good idea in terms of

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,979
security people want to be part of the

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,839
IT collected they want to be part of the

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,460
group that that sort of drives the

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,810
business they want to be successful just

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,250
like all of the rest of the IT

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,720
organization does so there's a really

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,220
important aspect of this that that it

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,920
covers more than just security but it

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,040
covers why why should you involve your

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,270
security people in your dev ops program

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,800
it's because security people are people

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,310
too and apparently united states that

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,089
corporations are people too but who knew

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,680
so the you know the issue for me is that

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,120
that a lot of IT people perceive

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,670
security people as being a different

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,580
sort of a different bunch of a group of

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,839
people people that don't actually share

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,550
much DNA with the rest of the Archie

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,740
organization they're weird specialists

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,450
they don't really know much about what

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,920
the actual IT organization does and

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,870
sometimes they know even less about what

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,380
the business does this is actually not

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,570
true so if I looked at the team I built

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,400
in my last royal security team I had a

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,890
bunch of people who would not be much

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,040
different from developers that code

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,380
reviewers penetration testers guys who

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,690
had you know spend a lot of time deep in

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,730
things like assembler and see right up

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,140
to people who could you know scan

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,000
through it scan through a few million

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,320
lines of Java or worse if you millions

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,240
of cobalt and tell you where the

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,170
security prompt the problems are the

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,670
security people who manage your

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,260
firewalls who look after your encryption

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,790
they're just operations people they do

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,220
exactly the same job they use the same

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,770
tools they have the same methodologies

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,390
you know you show a security person an

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,100
ops checklist and you show an ops person

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,510
a security check was essentially the

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,940
same document a little slightly

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,430
different bent there's people who do DBA

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,240
stuff anyone who does horrible things

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,709
like I don't know peoplesoft security or

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,660
you know something like that those guys

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,580
are those guys are essentially you know

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,020
roughly a DBA sort of person a lot of

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,550
security people who do network stuff

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,260
they're no different from a network

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,240
engineer and same with storage people

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,010
etc etc so it made a lot of sense to me

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,779
that you know we are very similar

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,610
community security people we fit into

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,150
this world we should actually be part of

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,580
this community the other aspect in here

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,410
is that if you are doing devops tough

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,910
you are about to make a fairly radical

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,730
change in the way your business works

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,560
and the way you operate things and the

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,170
temptation in that that thing is to say

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,060
that well know where it is do we still

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,110
care about security now if we deploy 10

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,510
times a day we're not gonna have time to

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,400
stop for security stuff and that's the

00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,650
wrong approach to take the tape roach to

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,120
take here is that security should be an

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,080
important aspect of all of this sort of

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,310
stuff if you've got if you're going to

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,779
if you want to put before on the

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,310
accelerator you want to make sure that

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,440
all the groups in organization are a

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,730
happy with that decision and be you want

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,380
to make sure you're making good risk

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,940
decisions and security people are

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,310
actually really good at working out what

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,050
a good risk decision is and sometimes

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,970
not so great at communicating them but

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,930
that's a skill that they can learn but

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,030
they're really good at working out you

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,140
know how we can do this and this is the

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,780
things we should think about these are

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,630
the controls we

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,660
think about putting into place and a big

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:33,090
part of that is that that evolution for

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,590
for security people is a mutual path so

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,210
you know you you are going to find that

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,820
that there will be resistance inside

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,200
your organization of DevOps concepts you

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,910
know the classic scenarios i've decided

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
things like increased deployment and I

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,780
Jean mentioned it is talk that you know

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,670
that people immediate media reaction

00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,870
when you say let's do things faster is

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,270
on the god no let's do things slower

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,460
because you know you obviously get heaps

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,810
better at jumping out of airplanes and

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,900
but you know with a parachute if you

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,130
only do it once a year whereas know if

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,180
you are going to do that thing they

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,350
accelerate that thing you need to be

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,780
really good at it so all the people

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,040
involved all the people in the light in

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,170
the life cycle need to be able to

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,090
understand this as well and the classic

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,650
example I give is that you know you

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,420
you're in an organization you've

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,890
introduced some dev ops stuff you know

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,200
your biggest problem in the past was

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,790
that getting service to a project team

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,050
took six to eight weeks because you know

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,480
there's the procurement guys needed a

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,830
sign a form and then the project manager

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,940
need to raise the right form and then

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,440
somebody else needed to order the

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,360
machine you need to get shipped in and

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,890
need to get built and a pass from about

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
six different teams to get built and

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,490
finally gets handed over the project the

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,930
project goes yeah we want to connect it

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,550
to the network and then the network team

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,680
has to raise a request to get a port

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,910
open in the firewall team needs so you

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,500
notice a part of that exchange there's a

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,560
whole bunch of different people handling

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,880
stuff in that so if you fix a couple of

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,070
those problems if you make your

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,010
procurement faster or if you make your

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,650
operations faster or if development and

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,240
QA you know decrease their test cycle

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,820
but it still takes your four weeks to

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,460
get a file will open you don't solve any

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:05,560
of your problems so it's something that

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:07,960
needs to be done in conjunction so a lot

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,280
of the time when I was thinking about

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,720
this I was like in all ways well how do

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,220
you get security people what buttons can

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,540
you push to get security people to care

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,430
about this dev up stuff and a large part

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,020
of it as with all day ops isn't about

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,120
tools isn't about really about

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,970
methodology like much it was about

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,410
people and I talked earlier about the

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,660
fact that security people are people to

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,130
their people in your organization it's

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,390
changing some of those cultural barriers

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,690
and they're particularly bad between

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,040
i-10 security oh you know the DevOps

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,560
movement is famous for saying that but

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,000
you

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,160
classic scenario of the developer

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,870
writing an application and you know

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,980
getting to Friday afternoon throwing it

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,690
over the fence saying it's deployed

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,940
here's the war file rushing off to the

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,160
pub and getting drunk and the operations

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,040
team going oh my god we've got to deploy

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,540
this and they you know they've deep they

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,460
install the application discover it

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,480
doesn't work because they're rooting a

00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,890
virgin they've developed an aversion of

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,529
the JVM that we don't have in production

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,510
or it's not designed to be secure or

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,860
doesn't fit with the backup or the IP

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,120
address is a hard-coded of you know a

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,800
number of dozen reasons so that's a

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,339
classic sort of why debt instead

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,880
opposite good ideas scenario and in that

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,529
in the same way you know that that end

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,930
result of that is obviously a

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,860
post-mortem on Monday or worse three

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,560
o'clock in the morning on saturday

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,270
morning where where somebody says I hate

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,370
you guys you guys are scrapped code and

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,260
the operations you know the development

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,990
of going would worked on my machine you

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,520
guys are obviously stupid and therefore

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,960
you know that that I've been in that war

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,140
in the number of times that conversation

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,490
deteriorates really rapidly to to all

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,150
sorts of name-calling and occasional

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,320
violence but what's even worse is I've

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,089
been in those war rooms where it's a

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,950
security problem and security people are

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,210
very defensive like like your job is to

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,980
be like sort of a little bit a little

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,970
bit defensive about things but they can

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,650
be tend to be a little bit you know

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,970
rough around the edges when it comes to

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,010
dealing with other people and dealing

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,390
with these particular problems they

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,300
could you know those scenario is equal

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,280
and equally ending things like we went

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,620
live with the application and we

00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,820
discovered on the day before you know

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,380
therefore we were like we discovered up

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,320
let's say a severity one vulnerability

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,089
in some of the curtain in some subsystem

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,010
or something we use to do it but we

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,360
launched anyway because you know and the

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,620
security team goes you didn't tell us oh

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,030
my god this is exposure you know we

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,580
could lose million dollars an hour and

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,220
this conversation very quickly degrades

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,630
from there so the sort of cultural

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,160
interactions that security and

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,959
operations people have that security and

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,209
development have are very similar to the

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,240
cultural interactions that developers

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,890
operations have so it's really important

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,570
up front security people used to being

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,620
blamed for things by the way you don't

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,470
know we do familiar with this but we are

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,180
really easy target projects that are

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,680
about to go live when you discover some

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,660
vulnerabilities the project manager is

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,310
like awesome I get an extra four weeks

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,450
on my Gantt chart because securities

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,480
just told me a bunch of things is wrong

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,339
and I get to blame them for it

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,870
it's never by the way the security bugs

00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,630
problem it's always the security theme

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,940
for finding the bug this is a fairly

00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,560
classic corporate scenario and project

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,170
managers I you know I must admit project

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,180
managers sometimes you'll do this in

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,709
security people sometimes their behavior

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,910
will also contribute to this but first

00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,070
thing to do is destroy that blame

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,839
culture destroy the culture of this is

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,519
your fault this is um this is you know

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,990
John Wall sport talks very heavily about

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,490
the fact that you can't actually have a

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,440
proper conversation about a problem if

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,750
your primary interest is covering your

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,850
ass or finding someone else to blame for

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,649
the problem if your primary in turn the

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,120
conversation is solving the problem all

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,430
of a sudden a whole bunch of stuff goes

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
away and a whole bunch of interactions

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,540
become really smooth I strongly

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,089
recommend your regional spores posts on

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,459
his blog about running blame free post

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,990
mortems because when I read those I was

00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,519
like I remember some of these

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,870
conversations where I'm sitting down

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,490
with the network vendor I'm seeing down

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,500
with the security team and you can see

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,389
the first thing in there is I hope I

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,850
hope we didn't do anything that caused

00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,380
this problem how do we make somebody

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,000
else's problem ah the network team

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,529
upgraded the firmware definitely can't

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,180
be a problem if that's the first thing

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,399
you're thinking about you're not going

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,220
to achieve very good results you need to

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:06,459
get rid of that culture the second thing

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:08,290
is oops is going on here sorry I'm going

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,410
to my slide desserts decided it doesn't

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,880
want not to change so the second thing

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,990
is you need to start to speak some of

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,250
the same language and I think I've

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,740
mentioned the talked a couple times the

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,299
word risk good risk is a really

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,829
interesting term in the corporate world

00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:24,069
it means a whole bunch of different

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,679
things security people mean it you

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,750
generally take it to mean you know I'll

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,270
give you a definition this definition of

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,450
horrible as well this is not for this is

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,880
more for edification rather than are

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,470
this is from the decisive standards risk

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,640
management is the process of identifying

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,590
vulnerabilities and threats the

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,740
information resources use finally my god

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,390
are you asleep i am so security people

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,799
use this all the time to sort of and

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,080
they come up with elaborate systems to

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,669
sort of determine how we know how big a

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,990
vulnerability something is or high-risk

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,980
something is you made up of the research

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,990
rated stuff all the things that don't

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,610
mean very much but there's some really

00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,110
useful things about risk that that's

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,669
actually easy to adopt and easy to

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,990
change and learning how to speak some of

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,770
that risk language is a really good way

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,890
of communicating

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:11,650
security people first of all most risk

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,880
is is essentially is risk is about

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,590
letting the business do business with

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,680
the right controls there are controls

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,060
are things like you know we have a

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,490
particular we have a particular exposure

00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,020
or vulnerability we stand to lose no

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,540
let's say that we state we start to have

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,310
our public web facing presence down and

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,750
we're a public listed company we could

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,450
lose a lot of money and PR and

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,030
credibility so we should assess that in

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,620
terms of actual the actual external

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,450
facing real-world consequences of that

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,700
instead of like you know this is a

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,670
technology risk because you know it's a

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,500
it's a step up you know I step up the

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,210
indication problem that you know this

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,680
particular vulnerability stop talking in

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,030
terms of those technological problems

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,400
start talking in terms of terms that the

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,050
business will understand if you start to

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,220
introduce some of that conversation into

00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,480
the business and for both of our

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,340
operations for the development spective

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,540
and for scuba spective is you like okay

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,070
I want to talk to a bit about the risks

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,740
involved in house doing this particular

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,180
thing how do we quantify those and then

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,710
start to quantify those risks in terms

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,690
of in terms of business terms in terms

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,210
of this is actual dollars we may lose

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,510
this is actual know the potential public

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,340
exposure a particular problem and

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,870
there's a lot of there's a lot of really

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,160
useful outcomes from that is because

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,990
security models are built on this old

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,390
risk concept you can plug into that that

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,800
concept you can identify the things that

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,990
DevOps a good app that will make risk

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,710
make doing business in our with the

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,960
right controls easier here's a here's a

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,540
really good example of talking controls

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,670
and why and why security people care

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,310
about this stuff so provisioning and

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,450
deployment I talked earlier about the

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,190
fact that you know if you've got a life

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,840
cycle and involves engaging security

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,810
people say burn firewall rules or change

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,280
network ports or you know added

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,170
encryption interface or whatever happens

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,760
to be if you're going to demonstrate to

00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,320
them that that the particular process

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,180
you're adopting makes it a hell of a lot

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,550
more efficient for them to do that that

00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,650
their life gets easier and those

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,960
concepts like self-service here but also

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,070
concept like no you should stick all of

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,810
this configuration in a version control

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,280
system you should use a configuration

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,110
management tool anything that will make

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,970
their lives easier the actual guy

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,410
operations guys on the ground their

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,580
interests in the same things you are as

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,290
operations people the same thing

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,610
developers interesting which is solve

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,340
the problem as fast as possible so I can

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,480
go to the pub

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,820
and the second one their configuration

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,600
management configuration drift and

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,309
inconsistency it to be I've dealt with a

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,130
lot of different sort of threats as a

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,409
security person my biggest view is not

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,700
some guy in Bulgaria with a PhD in

00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:37,460
mathematics who wants to try and

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,140
penetrate you know our internet banking

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,460
system not particularly worried about

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,990
that guy there's a there's a handful of

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,730
them some of them are really smart I

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,590
probably don't have a defense against

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,809
lot of those guys my biggest fear is

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,789
inconsistency and configuration drifts

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,950
because that happens naturally it

00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,600
happens at through entropy it's very

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,940
hard to control and it happens in a

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,710
large-scale kind of way if I can

00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,390
introduce some new controls like puppet

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,950
or chef or something like that in that

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,419
as a way of actually controlling that

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,330
configuration drift about actually

00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:07,669
preventing that inconsistency then I'm

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,850
going to significantly reduce the impact

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:12,440
of a particular problem my environment

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,909
I'm Chris goodness and even over the

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,570
whole environment reduce my risk

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:19,100
exposure I reckon if you those of you

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,529
who operate the new operating a business

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,480
has a risk register like you have a team

00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:26,450
that the constructivist of risks so

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,100
there's some isp guys that but a lot of

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,720
our organizations have or do you have a

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,770
list of security problems or security

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,690
registry if you have a security team

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,740
that does that there's a long list of

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,720
things in there and a lot of them will

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,360
say things like this system is not

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,100
patched to this version or this change

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,309
this this configuration is changed this

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,029
way across ten percent of our systems

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,220
configuration management is a really

00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,510
fast way of knocking out a whole bunch

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,890
of low-hanging fruit from that thing and

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,480
security people will love you if you

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,690
provide them other way to get rid of

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,149
some really annoying things um thirdly

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,700
you will probably work in organizations

00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,500
that have lots of machines if I

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,419
challenge you to tell you tell me the

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,620
sort of useful information about a whole

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,210
bunch of those machines those of you

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,020
some of you might have a cmdb maybe

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,049
anyone have a CMD be Wow as I think one

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,059
person he works at opscode that's that's

00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:15,500
a shame seem divis are awesome when they

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,970
work soon derbies all tend to be really

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,580
bad because they tend to be two or three

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,200
weeks at a date so what happens is when

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,059
you have an incident you go I would like

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,190
to look up the particular configuration

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,899
of this particular instance of the JVM

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,920
I've got that in one of my configuration

00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:31,660
management databases okay last

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,040
was updated three weeks ago and in the

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
meantime six people have made a change

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,390
and as a result you tried you try to

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,500
draw a remediation that doesn't work

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,060
incident management information is king

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,120
so knowing stuff about the environment

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,530
I've been in situations where i was i

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,730
was called into a war room because i'm

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,050
the only person who had a network

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,240
diagram for some critical part of the

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,460
infrastructure if you have tools like

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,020
configuration management audit tools if

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,610
you are looking at sort of automation

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,080
then you have a whole stock of

00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,710
information that's really useful to the

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,150
security people this is linked to the

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,330
last item which is audit magic way

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,040
auditors and i think the the really

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,020
interesting part of this is that a

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,340
significant number of the time security

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,470
come and bother you is about things like

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,750
patching packaged really annoying

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,710
because security people come to you and

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,540
they say we've identified a

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,510
vulnerability in the JVM tell me how

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,500
many systems are vulnerable and you go

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,350
bugger all right well there goes my

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,000
weekend run script run more script oh

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,200
that's in the damn said will tunnel

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,370
through this pack bounced through that

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,050
you know gather this data and i'll come

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,400
out in two different formats i know i've

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,200
got to work out whether this version on

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,420
solaris is different version of this one

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,740
too and the compiler report you stick it

00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,270
in an excel spreadsheet and you give it

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,010
to the security guy week later or

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,480
something like that and a week or so

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,310
goes by and the security guy goes skip

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,180
all right it's vulnerable to of seventy

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,980
percent of the fleet we're going to

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,810
patch it please go and patch it now and

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,820
then you spend the next six months in

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,560
change windows where every subtle little

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,730
scrap your gap in your change cycle

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,560
you're trying to attach a different

00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,970
system with obviously that the resulting

00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,430
sort of consequences and and confusion

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,240
we have a customer of ours is Google you

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,590
may have heard of them they have a

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,890
search engine and they sell ads and

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,690
stuff they manage about 30,000 desktops

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,970
with puppet and one of the big problems

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,620
was audit I know the guys no securities

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,480
how Google's had some reasonably high

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,800
profile security incidents where some

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,380
bad people who live on the other side of

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,760
the world try to do bad things and

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,350
they're so as a result that auditors

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,180
come through fairly regularly and look

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,770
at all the systems and go you know you

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,180
need to upgrade this version of OS X

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,550
from here or this version of Java CH

00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,930
mijita here and that was a six to

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,120
eight-week exercise the orders would

00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,530
come in they'd review a whole bunch of

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,240
stuff that identify all the systems that

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,740
have a problem they compile a huge

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,790
report they break the report into list

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,770
of priorities and it's in the back the

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,330
operations guys and go upgrade and

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,150
aberrations guys will go

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,410
okay lets you know piece by piece will

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,480
go to an upgrade and six to eight weeks

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,070
to upgrade a for a purse everyone save

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,750
Java vulnerability that's a it's a

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,210
pretty big window there's also lots of

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,280
opportunities in there they decided to

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,320
install puppet Nigel Kirsten is now a

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,720
CTO installed puppet and he was like I

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,820
can now generate a report on the fly in

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,500
real time that i can send to the

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,730
auditors and I you know I pipe it

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,990
straight into an Excel spreadsheet and

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,210
dump it into an email and go straight to

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,350
them they can look at that report they

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,580
send it back and tell me what upgrade

00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,010
and then I go through my systems they go

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,800
who change public manifest hit enter

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,180
upgrade all of those systems this is an

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,500
extremely annoying problem for you and

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,880
it's also extremely annoying problem for

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,950
security people they would like this to

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,840
go away if some of you are DevOps

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,580
practices if some of your tooling allows

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,750
them them to this problem to go away for

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,880
them and they have to they can stop

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,110
nagging you um they have to do a lot at

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,890
astute those orders never talk to them

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,060
again they'll be happy people as well so

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,670
I'm conscious the time so I'm going to

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,610
try and speak even more fast than I was

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,960
not okay so ideas for collaboration so

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,980
this is going to be you know how do you

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,860
how do you actually get some of these

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:53,890
conversations to happen I think probably

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:57,970
really interestingly is get roles and

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,230
responsibilities right so in most of

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,060
your environments you have a bunch of

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,620
people who are you know the question

00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,070
earlier was like you know what is it dev

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,940
dev ops teams look like I think one of

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,190
the big liebig struggles between

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,560
developers operations people is is who

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,730
does what and and as a result know and

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,320
often that's quite linked to the the

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,090
consequences of doing what so the blame

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,740
piece of it but the who does what know

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,440
so-and-so packages something so answer

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,590
passes over the fence security does this

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,900
instead of instead of you know instead

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,370
of doing it this way actually sit down

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,960
and go if we're going to build a new

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,400
life cycle and you develop life cycle

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,080
and how the rest of the teams fit in how

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,850
does storage fit in how does networking

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,410
fiddy and how does security fit in make

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,730
sure you understand that if you're going

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,080
to change a bunch of the things about

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,310
the way that you operate your business

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,020
and the way you operate your IT

00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,630
organization is that you involve

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,800
everybody and that way you actually you

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,810
can take advantage of the sudden new

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,120
methodologies your security people who

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,320
are probably pretty smart people and

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,290
they've got good skills and they're

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,720
useful they know thing practical things

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,940
about things like development about

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,230
encryption

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,450
that I think my things use things about

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,540
network and operating systems involve

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,950
them in the process I mentioned earlier

00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,110
there's a lot of useful tool in that

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,060
comes out of DevOps if you can if you

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,340
can identify things in your security

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,370
teams list of problems low-hanging fruit

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,660
and point out to them we are able might

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,490
be able to help you solve this problem

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,870
if you can sort of sucker them in with

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,880
it with a little bit of you know a

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,940
kindness I guess that's a really good

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,130
way to sort of get started develop my

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,780
own security put security people into

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,360
development teams I cannot emphasize or

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,910
not as much much how really important

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,380
this is the worst case scenario for a

00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,000
security person is to discover there's a

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,350
new project that's about to go live a

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,430
week before it goes live and then

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,010
scramble to try and find all the

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,560
problems scramble to do a code code

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,570
review scramble to a pen test if you put

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,640
security people in at the very start of

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,480
the process when you're actually

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,250
developing our requirements when you're

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,510
actually designing architecture a whole

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,040
bunch of these problems go away and

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,600
you're never going to get a perfect

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,160
outcome right you're never going to get

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,960
the scenario where the security guys

00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,130
this security guy slipped let's face it

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,830
all of us would prefer if you stuck your

00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,600
laptop in a in a concrete block stuck in

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,760
a 44 gallon drum and dropped it off a

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,790
huge cliff because that's the safest

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,900
system out there awesome but you're

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,760
never going to win every no we're not

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,010
going to win that argument but if up

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,720
front somebody asks me the question what

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,850
can we do to make this better what's a

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,500
good architecture we can try I'm happy

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,970
to negotiate you that's much better than

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,560
me having a huge stand-up fight with you

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,240
about the fact that really really you

00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,100
should have done it this way or my god

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,810
you've used them i add a data encryption

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,610
because i read this article and all

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,130
those conversations are pointless and

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,750
boring because no one wins if you have

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,310
that conversation up front then you

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,530
actually I have an opportunity to say

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,090
okay there may be maybe the still

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,770
problems at the end but they're

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,570
quantifiable problems and we can work on

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:46,500
those they're not and become massive

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,380
unknown yeah the blind designed for

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,190
security deployed sanely and securely a

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,780
significant number of problems that

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,910
appear when you deploy applications in

00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,290
production guess what it turns out to be

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,850
something like we did know this port

00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,010
needed to be open or the firewall was

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,170
never got burnt or all of those sort of

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,020
issues are easy to solve if you identify

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,190
that security is something is you know

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,390
it's a base requirement of but most

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,340
application than something you do up

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,039
front

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:16,679
Ops teams in bed security into ops

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:20,500
escalations I when I first started in a

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,549
security role in a bank then security

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,380
had a separate incident management

00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:24,909
process for operations sometimes it

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,769
overlapped but most the time is entirely

00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:28,179
separate so I'd be getting escalated to

00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,980
a problem I'd be getting an incident

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,440
reported to me that operations was also

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,029
working on and I would often not know to

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,259
like an hour into the process that fact

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:36,460
that operations was pursuing what

00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:37,990
perceived to be an operational problem

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,720
while I was pursuing a security problem

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,129
and it turns out you know if I've been

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,360
sitting in the same room or having the

00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:45,610
same conversation will be in part of the

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,950
same group then all of a sudden this

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,500
problem stops happening additionally a

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,600
lot of the things you do during during

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,340
an incident have security implications

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,779
like if you're an operations person or a

00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,549
developer change you make on the fly

00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:00,340
they have some really big implications

00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:02,350
like I'm sure none of us have ever done

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,549
this but it would be really simple since

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,409
we can't work out how to trouble this

00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:06,730
troubleshoot this networking problem we

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:08,669
just turn the file off in this host

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,509
because nothing walking it then right

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:14,139
sure none of you have ever done that

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:16,929
have some consequences though yeah I can

00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:18,940
hear that there sure you've never heard

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:20,490
that particular problem but if you have

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,779
it security people in the room with you

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,980
know they're good at this stuff there's

00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,299
a good ways you can look at actually

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,409
solving this problem in sort of creative

00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:29,710
ways that don't expose you to mass

00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:31,029
amounts of real risk post-mortems in

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,009
post mourners we often come by with a

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,509
lot of action items things that we

00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:36,519
should do they all have often those

00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,590
acronyms have security consequences have

00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,250
conversations with those guys about in

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,480
those post mortems about you know what

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,649
we should be doing how we should be

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,529
doing at how we should be this more

00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:48,850
efficiently and how we should actually

00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:51,190
you know solve the problem in a sort of

00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,840
sign and secures it away security people

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,100
actually we like metrics I know in many

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,899
people know this but security people are

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,100
very metrics driven people you have a

00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:59,080
whole bunch of metrics and data they

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,190
actually care about they probably have a

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,960
whole bunch of metric society you care

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,940
about expose them to your metrics and

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,500
data there is nothing like as I said

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,179
before about patching nothing will make

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,649
a security person happier then not

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,269
having to go and find an operations

00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,740
person who is ducked behind the building

00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,909
or gone on holiday or eat from them

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,250
because they want to know the patching

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:16,480
status of the system if you go here is

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,720
access to our configuration management

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,789
database in a lot reporting data you can

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,530
I just have this query or his this

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,299
report will mail you every day that has

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,289
the status of that their bosses are the

00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,970
ones handing them for that information

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,530
if you provide that information to them

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,179
that's a really good way that's a really

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,510
collaborative and helpful way to get

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,309
them on side so I apologize for talking

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,549
very quickly I'm gene just went way over

00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:40,470
time it's shocking from did like that

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,799
thank you very much for your time much

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,799
appreciated

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,380
